# üíª Advanced Analytics in a Big Data World - Group 7

This repository contains the code developed by Group 7 for the course Advanced Analytics in a Big Data World. The assignments were completed using Python as the primary programming language. The repository serves as a collaborative platform for all team members of Group 7, housing the code for all assignments, including preliminary, final, and test versions.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Predictive Modeling for Airbnb Properties

The dataset is downloadable from [here](http://seppe.net/aa/assignment1/data.zip).
The leaderboard that presents our ranking is to be found [here](http://seppe.net/aa/assignment1/)

In this assignment, we develop a predictive model to estimate the "price per night" of Airbnb properties in Belgium. The notebooks present our process including exploratory data analysis, feature transformation, feature engineering and model evaluation.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Deep Learning for Image Classification

The dataset is downloadable from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13uqo4de3n0Of1X2Appt_G3WAUXqF3h4J?usp=sharing)

The task focused on image classification using deep learning techniques: distinguishing between food and interior images in the Michelin Guide and predicting cuisine type based on food images. The trained model to classify food vs interior of a restaurant is saved in the same folder with the name `food_interior_classifier.h5`.

#### Installation Guide

To set up on your local machine for this assignment, follow these steps:

1. Download the ZIP file from [this link](http://seppe.net/aa/assignment3/spark.zip) and extract it to a desired location (e.g., Desktop). The ZIP file contains a portable Spark installation with the latest stable version (3.3.2).
2. Make sure you have a Python 3 Anaconda distribution installed on your system.
3. Create a conda environment with Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed by running the following command:
```
conda create -n your-environment-name python=3 jupyter
```
4. Activate the conda environment using the command:
```
conda activate your-environment-name
```
5. If you are on Windows, double-click on `letsgo-win.bat` to start Spark. If you encounter a "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen" message, click "More info" and then "Run anyway". A Jupyter session should open up if everything is successful. Note that Java might require access to your Windows firewall, which you can safely allow.
6. If you are on Mac, open a Terminal window and navigate to the unzipped folder using the following command:
```
chmod +x ./letsgo-mac.sh
```
Assignment 3 outlines the findings of the third assignment, which focused on real-time sentiment analysis of reviews from the Steam website. The chapter covers the data collection process, sentiment analysis, and results.

#### File structure
`spark_streaming_saving.ipynb`:  A simple Spark Streaming script that saves the reviews in order to build our historical dataset
`merge_export_csvfile.ipynb`: To combine the text files from subdirectories and construct a dataset in CSV format
`spark_streaming_model_construct_predicting_original_dataset.ipynb`: A notebook that demonstrates the construction and deployment of a Spark streaming model for predicting on an original dataset.
`spark_streaming_model_construct_predicting_balanced_dataset.ipynb`: A notebook that demonstrates the construction and deployment of a Spark streaming model for predicting on an balanced dataset.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Graph Analytics on Twitch Data

Lastly, Assignment 4 presents the outcomes of the fourth assignment, which involved applying graph analytics techniques to Twitch data using Cypher. The chapter highlights the approach, analysis process, and key findings.
