21,21.0,21.0,21.0,21.0,136573277.0,1409300,"What a great start by Pendopo Creations to take a debut step in a early Q2 2023. This game kinda remind me of Lacuna and Virtua Verse since those games look pretty similar. But, review is review so I'm gonna tell what I felt and experienced while playing this game. 

Start by the premise of story, Setyo starting to take a step in Bay City as a foreign agent and then as a security of a tech company. While his colleague, Jack, who works in Bureau appearing in Bay City and gave Setyo a bad news about the lost of his sister so it forced Setyo coming back to Neo-Surabaya and find some clues about his sister. All I can say, the plot is properly wrapped in a 6 chapters in total which makes the story more focused. The story doesn't feel rushed at all. Plot is surprisingly attractive so the experience kinda similar as watching a movie. Besides that, the dialog is well written in english. So, from the story aspect, I could say this game is a have a great plot, not rushed, and a well-written dialog. 

For Indonesian folks, trust me, some of the dialog is so much related to our culture and society nowadays. One of my favorite is while there's a conversation talking about ""a department"" of a country that loved to block an access of one of a biggest game marketplace in a world.
Story: 8/10

Move into the gameplay, this game, put it simply, is an action adventure game with a side-scrolling thingy like Lacuna and VirtuaVerse. The most important value that been delivered by dev to this game is at puzzle and combat mechanics. Puzzle mechs are variative which make this game has a bit of repetitive level. I'm sure that you're not gonna get bored while facing all puzzles in every chapter on this game. Okay, let's say some of them are stealth, hacking like a Watchdogs game, bunker code solving, making a key, ""stay calm while disguise"" with a rythm alike system, etc. There's so much variation of puzzle so I can't put it here all one by one. Besides puzzle thingy, this game also have a freedom for us to fight some foes with any weapon and a combat system. A combat system is quite okay, i think. One thing that annoyed me is just an energy and consumable items while in a fight. Energy drought so fast and consumable items a bit complicated since you need to open an inventory first and the consume the item. It will be better IF this game giving us a ""quick action button"" so we don't need to try hard anymore. 
Gameplay: 7,5/10

The graphics is lovely jubbly. Imagine, the composition of 2.5D pixelated game combined with a proper lighting and synthwave colour tone is just right. It looks satisfying. This game is actually worth for some players who loves to see a pixelated or cyberpunk game themed. Give it a try!
Graphics: 8.5/10

Finally, talking about sound/audio. All I can say is the background music is well delivered in any situation so the tense properly build up while playing the game. When we need to be relax, stressed, pressured, it's all depicted good by a presence of a cyberpunk themed music. 
Sound: 7/10

So, in the end, the pros and cons of this game are
Pros:
+Better plot, movie alike and doesn't feel cheap. 
+Puzzle mechs variative which makes the experience doesn't feel bored.
+Dialog is well written, some of them talking about Indonesian culture and society issues
+Oooomagaaa, the graphics bro, beautiful. 
+There is so many Indonesian thingy in a game like tukang sate, kang cilok, preman, pertunjukan seni, etc while the game is delivered to be fantasy futuristic. 

Cons: 
- Game still buggy and stuck at loading because of steam overlay. pro tip: don't ever open a steam overlay while playing the game. Let's hope the dev will fix it, asap.
- Combat system duh idk, all i want is a ""quick action button"" and some clarity improvement while in a stealth mission. 
- Bahasa Indonesianya ga ada cookkk, semoga ntar ditambahin hehe, ksabar.
- There is no manual saving

Overall, this game is at 7,75/10. Is this recommended? Yes, it is recommended. With this rate of price, you can get an experience of exploring to a deep down of an Indonesian greatest civilization with hi-tech thingy with a great story and puzzle mechs. Let's go give em a try!

It's different from the other Frogwares Sherlock Holmes games in that you are solving one grand overarching mystery rather than individual cases, so I haven't had the experience of having to pick who I thought did it with what in that intense and wonderful way that the other games have, but the story that it is telling is so damn compelling that I don't care. I'm still finding clues and slowly piecing together what's happening, all while people are dying and crazy supernatural stuff is happening around me.

The juxtaposition of Lovecraft and Holmes works perfectly, the aesthetics combine well, and I love Holmes' analytical mind trying to work out why there's weird supernatural bullshit happening. I'm super excited to find out what is going on. 

On the mechanical side, this game uses the same engine as Chapter One but adds some excellent quality of life improvements. For one, I think the open world was a detriment to Chapter One, and this one is much more linear which is good. For another you can click Z to have all of the interactable items pop up around you, which is an amazing thing to have in this sort of mystery adventure game.

Special shoutout to the characterization, writing, and acting of Watson in this, he is so good.

Very excited to continue, and congrats to Frogwares for a great game.",1.0

28,28.0,28.0,28.0,28.0,119682629.0,1729900,"Now let me get this out of the way. The game has potential. But right now it's very clearly unfinished. My first problem is there being no tutorial, thankfully somebody posted a guide explaining the basic mechanics. Apparently there's a flow mode and different characters have different things they specialize in (For example: More damage but you take more damage, stronger flow mode, etc.) But I didn't even realize this for the first 10 minutes since none of this is explained to you. Even the guide doesn't specify what character does what. Also, speaking of characters. Their designs for most of them are unfinished. One character looks like they got somebody else to draw smoothly. The rest though are hand drawn models that look like a deveant art OC. Hell, in actual matches there's not even the character model. Just a rough sketch with basic outlines. Now (In my opinion) the worst thing about this game is there's no online multiplayer. Sure you CAN play with friends. But that seems local only. It could be a 6/10 with the online multiplayers, but without it (including the rest of my points) it drops down to about a 4-5/10. Fix all these issues and you got a solid 7-8/10 rythm Game.
TLDR; Add a tutorial and online multiplayer, along with finishing the characters and you get a solid game.",0.0
29,29.0,29.0,29.0,29.0,118681190.0,1729900,"Rhythm Brawl is a laughably poor Guitar Hero ripoff with an adversarial bent as you play a 3 button rhythm game to some pretty craptastic music and wonder why Valve doesn't have the quality control for Steam it so badly needs.  There's a few different game modes and you can play PvP or vs the computer or just watch the computer play itself, this is convenient because while the computer is playing itself you can go find a pencil to rupture your eardrums so you don't have to listen to the crap music anymore.  Very thoughtful of the developers there. 

The nicest thing I can say about this is that it doesn't use 2D retro pixel ""art"".  Unfortunately, instead, it uses some of the most eye gougingly bad high school art class dropout drawings (I won't deign to call that scribbling ""art"") instead.  Like really bad.  Pixel art would be better, seriously, it's atrocious.  The developers indicated they would replace it, but that hasn't happened yet, so the game gets judged for what it is. 

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the Godot game engine/toolset.  This is a very poor quality toolset sometimes used by amateur developers as it's free (so they don't have to pay for GameMaker Studio) and doesn't require advanced game development skills, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities (it's arguably worse than GameMaker Studio).  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.

They're seriously trying to charge money for this, $4 USD plus an eye watering $8 USD to unlock the rest of the game they haven't finished (yeah, there's DLC for an incomplete Early Access game, that's not okay to the point of being unethical).  All that for a business model to try compete with Spotify by charging $12 USD for 6 crap songs on Steam.  Ugh.  If you play this game I recommend proactively seeing an oncologist afterwards.",0.0

I would love to change this review to a recommend.

First off, A LOT of the art is unfinished. I'm of the belief that if you plan on making a commercial product, you HAVE to finish those kinds of assets beforehand. I understand this game is in Early Access, but this feels like an EARLY EARLY ACCESS. A would love to also see different character have different passive abilities and maybe an attack move that's different per character. More music would be awesome as well. 

Along with this, online play would be huge for a game like this. My final thoughts are that if you add Steam Workshop this could be the defacto Rhythm Fighting game that people have been begging for. You have something special here. Please add Steam Workshop. Other than that, if the game fixes these issues, this will be an incredible game.",0.0

You can view my initial impressions review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/9Wax1TLL-gc

Anybody who follows my reviews knows that I absolutely love VR roller coaster / amusement park rides. So this game should be right up my alley, a fun twist on the coaster formula with some action adventure thrown in. 

Yeah, this game took everything I enjoy about coasters and made it into a bland, repetitive game that sucks all the joy & thrills from fun rides. It's a poorly made game on the Unreal Engine. At least it seemed be to be running at a steady 90 fps on my RTX 3080 and it did not crash. That ends anything positive I can say about this experience.

The visuals are ugly. The UI is horrible. Your motion controllers (at least on the Quest Touch controllers) are mis-aligned with your avatar pickaxes / shield that you hold. The feedback from any action is terrible. I couldn't tell whether I had hit an object or if I had correctly blocked or dodged out of the way. The sounds are bad as well. The music is bad. The gameplay is bland and repetitive. 

I would not recommend this game if it were free to play. I wanted to quit after 30 minutes of gameplay. I went with my gut feelings to quit and do anything else. Maybe someone out there can play this game for longer than 30 minutes, but for my own sanity I will uninstall this game and never play it again.

It's nuts and easily one of the better ""Vampire Survivor-likes"" out there. If you're looking for a wild time where you spent a few minutes between rounds figuring out a ton of gimmicks to chain together to create utter nonsense before you fight again, this is for you. It's more or less an ""engine building"" game, where one thing triggers another thing and efficiency buffs damage and things... Start off with a simple Spine and a tentacle gun, make it so that tentacle gun bursts into a giant skeleton blade on contact and poisons things. Use another brain to maybe build a function that connects all enemies who are poisons to be chains together by a death beam that saps their health for five seconds. Now do that for a default (for most prototype characters) for 8 total modules and level up to maybe 12, and up to four brains doing different things. Want to go summoner? Take a Queen and pick up every spawn thing you can, make them shoot instead of you or carry around debuff clouds. Want to machine gun things? Take a bunch of piercing tentacles and boxer nerves to trigger a lot of ""on hit do this"" commands. Don't worry about committing to stuff... you can tear these structures all down and reuse your components or sell them off between fights. Also has a trial mode so you can test your crazy thing before you actually have to worry about dying. 

Freaking fantastic. Thoughtful, strange, and something to really make you think a bit to optimize. Only real complaint at the moment is enemies mostly just run at you at various speeds and take more or less damage. Feels like they're just messing around to get all the node building right at the moment and maybe enemies become more interesting in the future. Still, worth it just to screw with.

[i]Simple Sky[/i] is top-down twin-stick space-shooter/score-chaser with some unique ideas. The simple and bright artwork gives the game a friendly appearance, but after I headed into the main game, I quickly realized that it gives the player no quarter. There are 10 difficulty settings, and only two are unlocked in the very beginning. Well, so far, I have yet to unlock another. Please keep in mind that this game is in Early Access currently, and some of my discussion may be outdated by the time you are looking at the game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The idea is simple, you start off as a ship with a main and secondary weapon, all of your movements use your energy reserves that spontaneously regenerate, and every action has a cooldown. Enemies start coming after you in what almost seems like a survival arena and you need to fend them off until the boss encounter for that particular stage, after which you can complete the stage and move on or stay behind to gather some more resources, though with a finite absolute time limit. There's a visual countdown to when things start going haywire if you stay too long, so it's not difficult to gauge this.

During your time spent on any level, finding local planets of various sizes and mining their resources will be very important. These resources are currency that you also get by killing enemies and you can upgrade your ship every time you reach a preset ""value."" You need to be docked on a planet while you upgrade, and this isn't difficult, you can run headfirst into a planet and that counts as docking.

When you make an upgrade, you are given a choice from 3 random selections. You can gradually maximize your firepower, your abilities, your cooldowns, HP, etc. through your various upgrades. You can even increase how many selections you get when you upgrade. If you get lucky early on, you can take an upgrade to make it possible to upgrade mid-flight, which doesn't seem like much, but is actually a huge boon. Or at least I think so.

In each level, you are constantly being hunted by the boss, which slowly approaches you from afar. You can see where it is and where you are, along with locations of the different planets on the minimap. It would seem that either avoiding the boss in the beginning or heading right in may each have its own benefits, I have yet to figure out the perfect strategy.

The individual runs in this game are usually pretty short. If I don't have a good combination going for me from the first few upgrades, I find that I can rarely make it to or past the 2nd boss. With some nice upgrades working in nice synergy, I was able to get to what I thought to be the final boss on the easiest difficulty, though I still struggled to live to the end. I would say average runs for me when things are going well are around 15 minutes or so.

There is a lot of movement based on your momentum, and because you are a ship moving around in space, you can expect to have some arcing movements and annoying ""sliding-on-ice"" feel as you try to maneuver around. This is just something to get used to, it's a game decision that will make a lot of people throw their hands in frustration but it's a decision specifically for this game. Once you get used to it, it won't feel so bad.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
Keyboard and Mouse required, and for some reason I had to launch this on my laptop, since on my main PC, the keyboard was being recognized in the menu, but once the run started, it wouldn't respond. I do hope that this gets hashed out and not too many people buy and need to refund due to unrecognized keyboard controls.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The artwork in this game is nothing to write home about, everything is pretty simplistic in design. It has bright colors and simple designs that give it a bit more friendly appearance, but the game mechanics beg to differ.

[h1]Music & Sounds[/h1]
The music gets super repetitive, to the point that I had to turn it off

[h1]Audience[/h1]
This is where I struggle a bit. I would say more for people who don't mind repetitive deaths and are okay with working through the initial slow bits in an arena-survival/shooter game. The run becomes more enjoyable when you can survive the initial start-up phase, which can be over quickly if things fall in nicely, but can also draw on for a while.

[h1]Pricing[/h1]
Early Access base price is $9.99 with regional pricing. It does have some replay value in that you are trying to chase the high-scores in kills during your runs while also trying to beat the game as fast as you can--the two leaderboards on Steam. I think the price is fair as far as people who enjoy the game are concerned. Those who cannot stand it have plenty of time to experience it prior to making a decision to refund, if truly they determine it's not worthwhile.

[h1]Personal Wishlist[/h1]
1. Have the issue fixed so I can play on my main computer, but the problem is that I have no idea what the issue is.
2. Having a bit simpler initial stages of each run when it comes to upgrades. I find that it's the part I enjoy the least and it tends to drag on for a while, and for me that's the do-or-die part of the run. If I make it, the rest of the run is enjoyable, if I die, then I have to start over from scratch and keep my fingers crossed.
3. More clear-cut synergy effects when upgrading, maybe showing some numbers/stats or highlighting which other prior upgrades will benefit, etc. It would be nice to know whether I am making a good decision or not when upgrading.
4. The mid-flight upgrade option comes up infrequently and I personally dislike the fact that I have to dock to upgrade prior to getting this. I almost wish the requirement to dock to upgrade would be removed completely.
5. More weapons/upgrade options, etc.

Bottom line in regards to this section is me saying that for these kinds of games to keep me interested, I need to see faster earlier progress to get to the fun parts, to keep me coming back and playing another run. It's not difficult to start another run after the previous, but the desire to immediately start is definitely hindered by the knowledge of the beginning grind. It may be only a few minutes, but it's enough to make me hesitate. With that and some additional QoL changes to facilitate smoother and more streamlined gameplay, I would enjoy it a lot more.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[i]Simple Sky[/i] is overall pretty fun, and so far I am enjoying myself. I realize that this game is in Early Access and so I hope to see some improvements in the aspects that I have requested, just to make it even more fun. I have confidence in that this developer will make the game better from its current build as there seems to be an update every time I look at it, especially with the latest one around a request that I had made.

Current score 7/10 (written Oct. 9, 2021).

Thank you for reading.

An interesting point is the combination of effects, for example the ice tower only slows the enemy, but when the enemy is wet, they can be frozen by the ice tower, and you can wet the enemy with traps or water tower.

I'm not having this problem with Wildfrost.

Now obviously I've only played an hour so far, and I definitely haven't made much progress, but every time I've died so far, I've always felt like it's my fault in some way, whether I made a stupid decision or didn't prepare well, and even in the times when RNG has screwed me via lacking options for card synergy or in-battle junk, it still feels so much less frustrating than in other roguelike deckbuilders. I think this is partially because of the way the gameplay is structured; there's no obvious endpoint, just a continuing path, and you're not spammed with cards or the like. Every encounter keeps you incredibly invested with how you're strategizing, and even when you lose, the progression with the town can help you still feel as though you're making progress.

If you really want to try this game but aren't entirely sure, I'd say go for it. I'm having a blast so far and the literal only reason I'm taking a break after an hour is because I, unfortunately, have important things to do T_T But I will absolutely be back ASAP to see more of this game.

 I think a good thing to do after beating all the levels and collecting all the 40 (? it was an even number I arrived at and I stopped seeing anymore) green coins is to try to beat all the levels with sub-one minute times. The levels feel like they're specifically engineered for this time frame in mind and it forces you to play creatively. 

I want to see this expanded into a larger game. I think the mechanics are polished and the understanding of how to implement platforming gimmicks is there. The dev is obviously very skilled at what they do. I think I got more than 3 dollars of fun out of this. I think an expansion on the concept should provide a purpose to the in game timer, such as beating a dev time or maybe a standalone collectable like the crash bandicoot games.

This is a ringing endorsement but I am going to post the few observances I have with the game after this, as well as my level times. (played with a controller)

good
+ All platforming is incredibly tight and telegraphed very well. 
+ The little overworld is very fun to navigate however small it is. There is one out of the way place that immediately opens a warp after getting it and you can actually skip a few intended platforming parts using the core mechanics.

neutral
= there is an acceleration you have with gliding, it feels like the opposite of what gliding would normally do. I consider this neutral because after you get used to it it feels very satisfying to move around, but there is a learning curve.
= physics with any moving stage gimmicks can be odd at times. It's consistent and you can actually use little things like leverage from spinning platforms to push yourself upwards a bit for more air but it may not do what you expect at first.
= In my opinion, I think the gold coins should be finite. It would give an easy third goal to the areas, and you can very easily afford everything even without the respawns. being able to grind it feels like I didn't earn it. I don't know how much I can criticize the economy in a 3d platformer though. 

bad (these are really really minor issues)
- recovery from a dive seems inconsistent. Sometimes I can recover and other times I feel like I can't and go barreling off the edge. This feels intentional but I couldn't get a feel for what triggered specific reactions.
- The camera snap during the sections where you're repeatedly hitting boosts is a little jarring. This only happens once or twice.
- I would like a little page in the menu that tells you all the information from the levels you completed. this is small but would be important for a larger game. It would have made tracking my level times at the end slightly easier too.

[b]+ A captivating twin-stick shooter metroidvania game with a physics-based grapple and engaging story!ヽ(´• ω •`)、[/b]

[h1][b][1] Intro [/b][/h1]
Rusted Moss is a twin-stick shooter metroidvania game that features a physics-based grapple and full 360° aiming system. Set in a wasteland once inhabited by humans, this game provides a challenging and immersive experience that allows users to feel in complete control of their character.

[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]

The game's twin-stick shooter aspect emphasizes tight and precise gunplay, with players quickly switching between their arsenal of weapons to best suit their playstyle and situation. Players can get up close and personal with a shotgun before grappling away and pulling out a sniper for the killing blow.

The grappling hook is the standout feature of the game, which takes some time to learn but is ultimately rewarding to master. The physics-based elastic grappling hook allows players to latch onto any moss-covered structure and swing their way through the rugged terrain. The freedom created by the controls creates a smooth experience, allowing for creative solutions to flexible traversal challenges.

The game offers a challenging experience, with powerful witches and machine monstrosities as the bosses. Each boss fight throws its own unique challenge at the player, requiring them to push their gunplay and grappling hook skills to their limits. Players must dodge swords, avoid energy fields, and blast away at conjured spiders to progress.

The game features beautifully melancholic pixel art with a retro vibe and modern aesthetic, bringing the world of Rusted Moss to life with moody pixels and stylish animation. The game also offers customizable strategy and gameplay, multiple endings, and encounters with humans and fae folk who are trying to find their way through the world.

[h1][b][3] Verdict [/b][/h1]
In conclusion, Rusted Moss is a fantastic metroidvania game that provides a challenging and immersive experience with its physics-based grapple, twin-stick shooter gameplay, and engaging story. The game's pixel art and aesthetic add to the overall experience, making it a must-play for fans of the genre.

This game is a MASSIVE step up from the first game in every way. The music, the movement, the effects, the editor, literally everything. All of the tracks are diverse with different genres that one or two might have a special place in your heart, the movement being silky smooth makes the experience much more better and doesn't feel clunky at all, (unlike Soundodger+) the effects give the levels a much more stronger vibe to them and the freedom you have in the editor this time is insane. The game can sometimes not be very friendly with new players I'm gonna be honest and adding the shatter system on top of that can definitely ruin a players experience if they just want to play all of the levels for fun, but for people who want a challenge will most likely enjoy it. I've mostly spent my time on the editor on this game, but the main levels are really fun to play and the challenge level have cool mechanics that challenge your skill in unique and different ways. The easy and normal levels sometimes can feel lackluster, boring, slow, empty, etc. The advanced and expert levels can give you the real fun of the game. (though sometimes they're a big difficulty jump from their easier counterparts.)

Overall If you're really into bullet hell, this game is a must have. It's really fun and its tracks are absolute bangers.",1.0

The protagonist of the tale is a mixed-race fox who aspires to be something other than an alcoholic slacker. Let's just say that the story is quite basic and that your overall goal is to change your destiny.

The game plays like any other action/platformer. You can jump, scale walls, and attack. You immediately realize that the stamina system is involved in all actions, which is fine when done correctly and just for certain acts. However, in this game it’s highly aggravating because jumping also depletes your stamina. Platformers require a lot of jumping, thus you'll spend most of your time waiting for it to fully recharge before making a jump. Then wait once again on the following platform. And again.

The same goes for combat. Each battle becomes a chore due to the very slow recharge. You're moving around wasting a lot of your stamina trying to gather enough for just one hit. When you have enough experience points, you can increase your stats, but you must first kill enemies who use a totally absurd mechanic.

Enemies are brainless. They will follow you anywhere you go if you are in their line of sight, including across ledges, into pits, under spikes, etc. It is usually simpler to lure them into traps, which kill them and leave their corpse hovering in the air.

The game goes with old-school style of progress, which means linear path and no option to revisit stages. Even if stages include numerous paths and secret spots with gold and treasure, it's difficult to collect everything because it's so easy to die. Furthermore, if you just head for the exit, you can make things much tougher for yourself because each coin and experience point is valuable.

The overall difficulty of the game was the final straw that broke my back. There are traps everywhere, coming out of nowhere and taking cheap shots at you. Even if you survive falling into a hole, you most likely won't have the strength to climb out.

What makes this even more annoying is the lack of checkpoints. If you die, everything you collect is lost and entire progress reset. Any kind of exploration is entirely discouraged because you don’t want to spend time by carefully navigating the stage, collecting everything you can and then get killed by a stray arrow.

If you're like me and you're desperate for anything remotely good in VR, this will not suit your needs more than likely. Unless you and a friend are okay with wasting money on a thing you'll probably play for 20 minutes, then, I don't recommend this game. 

The physics is... fine? It's better than most other VR titles, and the full body part is the best aspect of it. However, meleeing with anything feels very bad, there's no sense of impact or collision. You can stick things to other things and make weird things, so in that way it's like GMOD but with like 3 tools. Gun, flight, and sticking things to other things. In it's current shape it's not worth the price of admission, and I couldn't convince any of my friends to get this game, so this is a review from the perspective of someone who put more hours than I'm willing to admit into single player GMOD. 

The interaction spheres appear under alarmingly specific circumstances, the gun interactions are bad/very inconsistent. Even holding things seems wonky, since I picked up two things with one hand, which I don't believe was intentional, because when I dropped both one permanently was stuck to my interaction button, so if I tried to take a mag out of my pocket, it would send me flying toward the corner of the map, since the 'jet' thing was still bound to my hand despite clipping into the ground never to be found again. I experienced this bug within like 15 minutes of play, and it happened to *both* of my hands. It seems like too big of an oversight. 

That being said, if this game got workshop support, fixed their interactions, upgraded melee, and allowed people to make some mini-levels to coop through with your friends (puzzles, combat, etc) or even had a miniture proof of concept coop campaign or even a wave mode, this game might begin to be worth your time and money. I went in with pretty low expectations, and even those weren't met. 

I'm not the biggest fan of Boneworks/Bonelab, but this game needs a few more months of [b]core changes[/b] to come even remotely close to the level of physics and interaction those games achieve. I understand this is likely a much smaller dev team with far fewer resources, but there's a lot left on the table for them to address. I hope it gets there, I do, and I'll be watching this game for updates, I'll try to re-review as more things get pushed out. Best of luck to the Devs.",0.0

The problem that lies in the narrative is the fact that this is not a game that has concrete ending. I had actually seen a D23 article this morning stating that there will be more Tron games by Bithell Games.
Last bullet point in this article [b] (https://d23.com/decoding-the-grid-a-conversation-with-tron-identity-producer-heidy-vargas/) [/b]

Why this was not said long before the game came out that this would be a multi part story is beyond me. Maybe I missed this information? Someone please correct me if so

Another positive about the story is that choices actually matter, given how many AAA games tote this saying plenty of times without delivering, this deserves to be commended, granted I will say the outcomes of your choices are very obvious and have very little surprise to them but that's fine given the scope of the game.

[h1] Game-play wise [/h1]
There is only type of puzzle which is not at all challenging. It appears quite frequently, almost at every story juncture with a certain character, due to the short run time of the game it thankfully never outstays it's welcome. It can also be skipped if you don't care much about it. 

[h1] Tron wise [/h1]
The tiny little nods and references to the movies (achievement names, certain codex entries) were well done. The new additions to the lore are cool and feel like they fit. World building is very subtle yet it's enough to set the stage of the world but it very much a start for the obvious sequels to come. The music is quite good, it's no Daft Punk or Joseph Trapanese but it's up there and is honestly quite memorable.

The game's controls are responsive, and the progression is well-paced. Throughout the levels, our goblin collects scattered coins which can be spent on upgrades, such as the beloved double-jump. Cleared levels can be replayed at any time, allowing him to access previously unreachable areas with his newfound abilities. For those seeking an extra challenge, the game can be completed without any upgrades, with an achievement as a reward. From time to time the goblin will encounter bosses, which, although easier compared to the levels themselves, are creative and add a nice variety to the gameplay.

An interesting aspect of the game is that all the sound effects are created using the developer's voice, which may initially feel unusual and take some time to get used to. Some players may find it awkward or irritating. However, it's worth noting that the game was made by one person, and this unique approach to sound effects adds to its overall ""hand-crafted"" feel.

It's impossible to die completely in this game. When all continues are lost, the goblin is sent to the Underworld level with infinite attempts (after all, you can't die when you're already dead), and clearing it resurrects him with 15 extra continues. This process can be repeated indefinitely, ensuring that the player won't lose all of their progress and have to start over. However, the game can still provide a challenge, especially for those aiming to collect all the coins.

Overall, this game is a great choice for satisfying old-school platforming cravings. It never gets boring thanks to unique and varied level designs, enjoyable boss fights, appealing pixel art, and just the right amount of difficulty to keep the player engaged. The only minor downside is that it runs at 30 fps due to engine limitations, but it doesn't detract from the overall experience. 
Give it a try – you might just enjoy it.

First and foremost, allow me to say that Caliber hasn't always been the game that it is now. If you have ever heard anything negative about this game, chances are those things no longer exist. The developers have been very open and willing to listen to the community in order to make this game worthwhile. And with that said, Caliber is certainly a game worth playing.

If you've ever played Ghost Recon Phantoms or SOCOM, Caliber is basically the spiritual successor to these classic third person shooters. There are a ton of unique operators to pick from, team based gameplay in which each person fills in their own role, fun co-op missions, various game modes, and no P2W. If you're a fan of third person shooters, tactical shooters, or shooters in general, you absolutely should give Caliber a try.

As someone that has been playing games since the early 90s, I would like to thank the developers for not only listening to the community in order to improve this game, but for making such a game to begin with. Caliber offers up a nostalgic experience, harkening back to a time when shooters weren't mindless, and horribly generic. You've done good, 1C. Keep it up!",1.0

There are also some strategy elements, such as building various buildings, collecting resources, implementing space stations modules etc. I have to say that this game really surprised me how well made it is. 

Story/Narrative:

I have to say that story is quite well written and everything is connected with each other. There is a lot of text to read, a lot of choices to make. Currently you can only play Chapter 1 (new chapters will come as DLCs) that has many mini chapters in it, and as you progress the story, you're able to learn a lot about who you are, what is your mission and what you're capable of doing. Prologue is some sort of Tutorial that shows you and teaches you how to play the game. The other chapters are specific stories that tell you about certain events. Now, the biggest pat of this game is that as Amender (controller of planets and universes) you have specific traits that influence the story. You can pick between 5 different paths and each brings unique traits and bonuses. In the story there will be some choices that you can complete and they have difficulty, ranging from very easy to very difficult. They do somewhat influence the story as it makes you get different ending and you don't collect all the information needed but the higher traits you have, the easier it is to complete them. For example, you'll have to talk about history of certain civilization and to complete that choice, you'll need decent knowledge on ""Strange Worlds"" that is a specific trait in the game. All in all, I have to stay that story is quite unique and it does get you hooked but I just wish that developers added the button that you can speed up the text since most of the time you yourself have to click Continue in order to progress through story and text is quite slow which leaves you enough time to read everything.

Strategy elements:

I personally think strategy elements don't influence the game that much. Yes, you have to collect resources such as energy points, technology points and population in order to complete some chapters, but at the same, you collect those quite fast and buildings are quite cheap to build. You can also upgrade them which allows you to gain resources faster. There are special buildings that do require some effort to build, and they bring you various bonuses and materials that are later required to build certain buildings. In general, it's not time consuming but you'll sometimes forget that they even exist or forget to upgrade them since you're mostly focused on the story. There is also war in this game. I personally think it's quite unfair for other provinces and countries to get attacked by you. Because you're technologically stronger and the higher population you have, the easier it is to recruit troops. Enemies are quite easy to kill and they won't pose a threat. I think it's more beneficial to just focus on your military rater than pure resources. 

Issues:

Even though the story is quite well written, music and images are well made, I can't suggest this game for everyone. First of all, the mechanics of the game are quite easy to master and the game doesn't offer much content. Yes this is visual novel, but at the same time developers could have given us something more unique to do in between the stories and the stories progress way toooo fast. As soon as you're done with one mini chapter, you can instantly go to the other. As I already mentioned, building and waging war isn't anything special and it really doesn't bring you much. Time in the game can be slowed down or fastened up. If you have enough time to read through chapters and chapters of the story and you really do like to immerse yourself in futuristic world where AI helps you with everything, then surely this game is for you.

Pros:
+A lot of game modes, both PvP and PvE. Not all of them are equally populated but you can find a match even in not so popular modes pretty fast.
+Over 60 characters to choose from. Different operators offer different playstyles, some are good for mowing down bots, some are perfect for PvP.
+Nice visuals with decent system requirements.
+No 'pay2win' - all operators can be purchased with ingame currency (and you don't need to grind for weeks to buy one you like).

Cons:
-Visual customisation system are lacking. You can apply different camos to the operator but most ot it can be obtained only during events or for premium currency. Nearly all of the skins with really unique looks are premium.
-Leveling up the operator can be tiresome - later levels require lots of XP and credits to grind.

1.  There are really no options.  You have one woman to impress and god forbid you choose wrong in one of the options you have, she'll friendzone you.  If you didn't find her attractive (and I really didn't--she was too heavy for my taste), then too bad.  She's the only choice in the game so far.
2.  No roll back.  Did you hit one of the choices accidentally?  Too bad. Replay the entire thing, or create tons of saves as you go.
3.  This next one goes towards the ""dating sim"" aspect.  If the one woman pisses you off (which she did), there's no option to tell her to go **** herself and walk off.  You're forced to be nice.  I would really have liked a ""b*tch, I have enough friends"" option.  I've never let a woman friendzone me IRL, and I certainly don't want to do it in a game.  There's great satisfaction in ghosting women like that.
4.  I suppose because it was by the same people that did College Kings, I was expecting at least the chance to have some good, meaningless sex.  That was not to be the case.  I suppose this game is G rated, or PG at best.  My hope is that the more episodes that come out, the more this will change.  I can ""not have sex"" with as many women as I want IRL. There's no need to go to a game to do it.
5.  I both understand and enjoy the necessity to build up to a relationship.  It was my favorite part about games like BaD and College Kings, but both of those games gave you significant feedback when you did something that would cause a girl to friendzone you, or not like you, or whatever, and you weren't friendzoned... you were merely ""in progress"" and the girls kind of let you know that.  In this episode, I got friendzoned and had no idea why.  None.

Again, however, this is all after just one episode.  Perhaps there's still hope and I do look forward to the upcoming episodes, but the lack of a rollback option is just AWFUL!  If you want to add an ""ironman"" mode where you can't rollback, by all means, do so.  I generally do my first playthrough keeping as true to how I would personally answer as I can and some kind of ironman mode for that would be fine, but to force everyone to play that way every time is absurd.

TLDR: As far as the final recommendation, I'm going to say for those seeking an AVN, this isn't it.  This is a teenage visual novel at best... no adult content whatsoever.  The dialogue is fun, even funny at points, but in it's current 1 episode state, I can't in good conscience, recommend it in its current state.  I will update the review as new episodes are released.",0.0

The progression unlocks different tribes (card sets) and some new cards, but the cards you have in the beginning are completely valid to win a run.
Cards can be upgraded in a run to focus on different builds.

- Cute minimalist aesthetics, that are well-suited for the worldbuilding style the game aims to set.

- Decent variety of items to make your base functional and shiny.

- Lack of any objective to complete whatsoever, without enough diversity of activities to make the gameplay interesting in the long run.

- Shallow, repetitive combat system that is a kiting game, a trade of blows without depth or any mechanical variety.

- Resource / durability economy issues: some are too plentiful, others too scarce or, in case of tools, break too fast compared to resource drop rates. No repair system.

- There are no bosses, random special encounters or anything else that makes exploration exciting after seeing biomes for the first time.

- Trading and trader reputation systems are a redundant gimmick that you won’t need at any point, and won’t create interesting opportunities at any point.

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Setting & Writing[/h3]
Without much preamble, your non-customizable character is dropped onto a tiny speck of land in the middle of the sea. Soon you notice the ability of creating more squares of terrain around you, and do so to expand the world map itself. There’s no story or lore to speak of, other than you have to survive in the wilderness by any means necessary, as the night is dangerous, while the day is peaceful.

 As much as sandbox games can be far from being story-oriented, the complete absence of any narrative element is a strong malus when there isn’t enough variety to compensate for it. The world itself is composed of tiles belonging to various biomes, each has a colorful and vibrant palette, but also feels static; there are no changes in the weather, and no interactions between confining climates or between animals, monsters and plants. Like a diorama with a few moving parts.

[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]
You’ll explore the world you yourself create on foot, or later on via mounted animals. Speaking of expansion, each new day will have you choose some “cards” belonging to different biomes, to then place them as tiles to expand the map. Each climate has different animals and resources, so varying the composition is fundamental to access all materials for crafting. 

The sense of discovery typical of an open-world survival is largely lost and washed-out, as even after many days the explorable world, including the underground level and the “enchanted dimension”, all matching in size, will still be small in size. You won’t even need a map for orienteering, and there isn’t one. As you roam these tiny expanses, you won’t witness interesting random events, rare spawns or other points of interest spawning at any point. The best you’ll get are goblin traders that you can shelter and house in your base, or animals to kill or capture and breed. The interest wanes after only a couple of hours, as you’ll have seen everything by then.

[h3]Combat System[/h3]
At night, monsters will spawn on any non-player made tile. The inside of your (hopefully) walled base is safe, but outside the hordes are relentless. Enemies vary per biome: for instance the ice biome will have evil snowmen, the underground caves have explosive spiders, and the enchanted dimension have floating, energy-shooting abominations. The way to defeat each foe  is always the same: kite them in a circle and keep slashing in melee, or wait between shooting patterns for ranged enemies. All of them have one attack pattern and follow mostly the same archetype, with minimal variations.

Your choice of weapons is limited to swords, throwing spears or, if you grind trader reputation enough, slings. Each of them has a single attack, with the sling capable of flinging various crystals and bombs as an exception. Enemies become repetitive and stale not after long, while the combat system simply doesn’t have the depth to keep being engaging. No armors, accessories, upgrades, unique weapons and so on are present at any point. Blocking? Parry? Dodge? Anything? Nah, forget it. Minecraft’s combat system is Dark Souls in comparison to Miniland Adventures.

[h3]Crafting & Base Building[/h3]
You’ll use four main workbenches to get anything done, from flooring to utility buildings, weapons and furniture. The crafting system is the typical one of any open-world survival, requiring you to have a certain amount of basic and processed materials to make a finished product. 

There’s no further elaboration or novelty to it. The economy is kinda broken, to the point I never used anything else than stone tools and Ruby (like Minecraft’s diamond) swords, as metal tools lasted too short compared to the effort to grind the materials to make new ones. Expect to take some time to have a spacious base with all the bells and whistles, even if most craftables are purely decorative or gimmicky - you won’t need them, unless you want to upgrade trader reputation by placing them in their rooms, which isn’t worth it anyway.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960460780

[h3]Trading & Farming[/h3]
Traders offer wares locked behind reputation tiers, gained by furnishing their rooms in specific ways. Some of these items can’t be obtained in any other way, however none of them is really worth the effort. The system exists and is even a decent concept, but has no incentive to be used. 

Farming works in a classic way: plant crops, water them daily or use an automated sprinkler, reap the fully-grown produce and repeat. Of course, some plants may only grow in certain soils or biomes, while animals won’t need care but eat specific vegetables to breed and have more to harvest, like sheep for wool to make an example.",0.0

It has more depth,  more characterization, more backstory, more interactions. Your MC has to actually work at developing a relationship with a female character  that wants more out of life. It's not a ridiculously stupid AVN,  which is the typical  visual novel genre,  but the audience for those stories are immature frat-boys or really damaged misogynists. It took just about two hour to play through the story,  and the price might be a little steep for the one chapter,  but if we're getting additional chapters later on,  it'll be worth the investment.

202,202.0,202.0,202.0,202.0,136559848.0,1949030,"This year has been a great period for horror game remakes between Dead Space and RE4, and now even Frogwares seems to be getting on board that train. If you aren't familiar with the older games in this series (like the one this is a remake of), you should know that despite this sharing a lot of the DNA of Chapter One, it isn't an open world game. There are a few small hub areas with occasional small diversions, and if you get the side quest dlc there's some side stuff to do throughout the first half of the game, but for the most part it's more like a traditional point-and-click adventure game campaign (which I consider a substantial plus, considering how poorly their attempts at open world games went). It's adjusted to be less inventory focused in favor of more of the modern investigation gameplay, but the main campaign is essentially one big ""case"", and it took me around 11 hours to get through everything. 

Its adherence to the original material comes as a slight detriment in some parts, because the pacing around the middle of the game was kind of a mess back then and to some extent it still is here, but a lot has been done to tidy things up and smooth over the rough edges. The writing is all around improved, the tone is more consistent across the board, and the story and puzzles have been changed up for the better. And compared to Chapter One, it's honestly just really nice to have Watson back again; I went into their previous game with an open mind towards Jon, but he just didn't have half the chemistry that these two have. There aren't any of Chapter One's unsolvable ""no right answer"" choices, and you never have to gun down a room full of enemies! It's just a fun game all around for mystery fans, and while it's not enough that I don't still miss the Crimes & Punishments style of gameplay and deduction, it's a level of compromise I'm happy to work with.

The original Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened was always a fairly substantial departure from what was normal for this series, injecting all sorts of horror and mysticism into the otherwise fairly grounded universe and then daring you to call it non-canon by bolting itself to the timeline with a single key plot element. I thought for sure that this would end up being more of a reimagining than a remake as a result, with it seeming to position itself as an official sequel to Chapter One, but it doesn't -- if anything, it gets even weirder at some moments, and I wouldn't have it any other way.",1.0
203,203.0,203.0,203.0,203.0,136559763.0,1949030,"No, it's still not on the level of Crimes and Punishments. It appears Frogwares just doesnt effin get it. We want the games to be more like C&P NOT what came after it. The design mistakes of The Sinking City and Chapter One are still present though they seemed to have realized the eavesdropping and combat sucked so they have been removed. Once again, you are asked to make choices on guesswork since they could really go either way, things will not be visible because you werent on the right viewmode or were not highlighting the the right clue. Yes, the silly pinning mechanic is still here, and the game wants to be a sequel to Chapter One, constantly referencing it. Chapter One was a mistake that should be forgotten, not referenced multiple times within the first minutes. You already have a foundation to build on, it's called Crimes and Punishments. The mind map has been simplified yet again, and in a more frustrating way that tells you what kind of clues to select and how many, in a much less intuitive or interesting way than select posibilities enabling a logic train of thought like the one in C&P and TDD. The new Mind Map is also ripe for frustration and bruteforcing as you will frequently know what the answer is, just not what evidence it wants as the chain of thought that leads to it (a common problem of detective games), or you know onlt the logic train to an answer and it comes out of Sherlock's ass since the player could not have pieced the finan deduction from the clues. I'm supposed to BE Sherlock, not WATCH and nudge Sherlock. This is not a Watson game.
Also, in that respect, the Imagination mechanic still solves the whole thing for you. You play a game of ordering very vague but still chronologically simple to follow events, but then Sherlock fills in all the blanks sometimes with plenty of information you didnt glean at all or couldnt be sure of. The character does the detective work instead of the player who gets to play a minigame and watch. Yaaaay.
 And once again, side cases either dont get a mind map at all or get an even more simplified one.
Oh, and in a cruel twist of UX, the archive is now accesed by looking at clues. I bet many returning players will try to access it by frantically pacing around the two inches of 221B you can move through repeatedly befroe realizing that. I'm beginning to think the game lacked playtesting.
I'll probably finish it as I'm out of other games but if you were hoping for a return to form, sorry, no. It seems whomever is in charge now plain and simply doesnt get the appeal of the best detective game they made, and has no interest in building on it. They like what I consider to be their worse games too much and will continue on the path they laid foward in them. Shame. Chapter One was a mistake and they are happy to keep making it. Fire whomever is in charge of CO and this pseudo remake and get the people in charge of C&P back on board for the next one.
P.S: Credit where credit is due, the game is really well optimized and while the animations are lacking, the character models for Sherlock and John are great.",0.0
204,204.0,204.0,204.0,204.0,136560732.0,2060670,"It starts off promising enough, but having played the full release, I just don't know why you would play this over almost any other competent release in the new genre.

The graphics are neat, and there are a lot of interesting things presented - talents on level up that unlock a new set of talents, choosing your starting basic weapon, the watering thing is neat and the building stuff seems interesting. The problem is, you don't get to interact with it at all. You choose from 4 options on level up, and that includes ""potions"" which are basically temporary buffs. The pool of talents is MASSIVE, and not weighted (as far as I can see). You get 2 rerolls per floor, which amounts to about 8 rerolls per run, which is basically useless for actually trying to do ""a build"". If you choose one of those ""class"" talents that unlock more options (mechanic, ki, etc.) it gets even worse.

Basically all the choices are worthless because, like all these genre of games, you need synergy and multiplicative power to survive, which means just take the most basic, passive stat upgrades, and the basic fish summon skills, and do the same thing every run because everything else requires a staggering amount of luck in your favor to see work. 

You can experiment on the lowest tier difficulty a bit but even then you'll often just run into not killing stuff fast enough which means less xp which means less leveling which means killing stuff slower which means spending 5 minutes after the end of the level timer dodging endlessly while you whittle away the hp of the boss (or you could go onward and forsake even more xp). Oh also you obviously get WAY less rewards at the basic tier. Also unlocking higher tiers requires beating the previous tier, which means doing incrementally less forgiving runs over and over using the same builds over and over because anything else could mean wasting 15-20 minutes of your time and not knowing it until the choices keep failing to happen.

There is a fun game hidden here behind the insane lack of meaningful choices presented to the player. If the level up options were like, 8 choices instead of 4, it would STILL be more RNG than most of these games, but it might be more friendly to try out other builds. There's just no reason to recommend this because it's closer to playing a tedious slot machine than a bullet heaven.",0.0

The main gameplay is typical for the genre. You advance through randomly created floors, defeat enemies, gather coins to spend on better goods in shops, and open boxes with perks. Everything is lost upon death, with the exception of special keys and stat improvements.

The unique mechanic is the blue and yellow energy. Numerous things are connected to each energy, and you can change at will. Examples include opponents that can only be wounded with the appropriate energy and chests that open only with the matching color. 

Additionally, some weapons and perks are energy-specific; they simply don’t work if you have the opposite energy. Fortunately, most enemies are in neutral energy, so you won't have to continually switch during combat.

Three keys are unique to each floor and are hidden in unique puzzle areas. These challenges disable your ability to switch between energies but give you doors that, after you pass through them, switch between the two colors. The goal is to push boxes and use doors to reach the final room with the key. 

You keep these keys forever because they let you open unique chests that make subsequent runs a little bit simpler. But the most important is the puzzle room that gives you coins at the beginning of each run.

The reason you want to do that is that items are pricey. It's nearly impossible to purchase anything just by eliminating enemies that randomly drop a chest of coins once you finish clearing out a room. While your starting gun has unlimited ammo, the short range and fun factor just isn’t there because you simply can’t afford a better gun at the start. 

The game's subject is time travel and experiments, therefore each ""floor"" is set in a different time period. Most enemies show up in all the stages, but there are still enough distinct ones to keep the game interesting. Four floors might not see much, but there’s enough content here to keep you busy for a while. A nice addition is a library that gets filled with all the weapons, enemies and perks you encounter.",1.0

There's the mind castle where you can solve the cases, but you need to gather clues first. They can be items, conversation topics or just observations. Then there's two difficulties, one which helps the player a little bit in finding clues, and the other one which doesn't.

Pro:
1- Game looks nice and runs smooth (for me).
2. Good concept but could be lacking longevity or replayability.
3. 3 different mines on the map and map is large although a lot of wasted space

Cons:
1. A lot of the controls are not really explained clear enough- especially when it comes to assigning haulers to diggers. Make sure you assign the hauler first then the digger or you will waste a ton of resources.
2. When it comes to the second and third mine- to load the cargo onto the barge or train- make sure you hit the Q and E key to open and close the scoops. Also was not clear.
3- The drill rig was also very confusing at first- but the arms can rotate outwards much further than it appears. You just have to keep moving them in a circle format to fully extend them. Might be easier on controller but on keyboard it was a chore.
 4. My biggest complaint and an issue I might be overlooking:

Workers do not seem to continue to work if you are not in the mines. At least it seems that way to me. So not much reason to have all 3 mines working. As there is no fast travel and it takes for ever to travel between mines- I think I am going to sell all the machines at the first mine and just concentrate on either the 2nd or 3rd mine. Someone could clarify if I am missing something here.

Anyway- that is my 2 cents- thanks for taking the time to read it.",1.0

************************************

I was one of the games playtesters and was fortunate to see the game grow over its development cycle. I have completed the game several times, and currently working through a play through of the release version. Even though my current hours on the release build are low, I am writing with the benefit of knowing what is coming from playing it first hand during tests.

Rusted Moss takes the standard metroidvania with double jumps and replaces it with a challenging but extremely satisfying grappling hook. Some people might find the grapple a challenge at first, but I found as I played more I was able to improve my skill quickly. And once you do.... wow this game really opens up. The satisfaction of landing a sick grappling sequence, or ""breaking"" the game in ways that while intended, allow for a high level of creativity in how you approach the game. Once the game 'clicks', you feel like Spider-Man swinging around as he pleases. The game also has optional climb challenges for those who stray off the beaten path that push the limits of the grappling hook even further. The grapple challenges alone would have justified my purchase as they are extremely fun and allow you to attempt to improve your time, pushing you to be better and better. However, the grapple isn't the only element of the game, and to ignore the other elements would be a mistake as they are also excellent.

The gunplay is tight and satisfying, and playing with mouse and keyboard allows for precise aiming giving me a sense of complete control of my character. When I make a mistake I know it was an execution issue on my end, not a cheap trick from the game. Save points are abundant, which allows you to experiment and go for challenges that otherwise might have seemed too risky. Boss fights have always been the thing I look forward to the most in metroidvanias and Rusted Moss does not disappoint on this front.  I especially love when the grappling hook is integrated into the fight itself as it adds a new element that I have not experienced before this.

The story is an interesting take with morally ambiguous characters, fighting for their lives in a war between the Fae and Humans. With talk of prophecies, secrets, traitors, and double agents, I was fully invested into the story and wanted to progress to find out what would happen next. The music of the game adds to the atmosphere beautifully, immersing me further and further into the game. Going from making me feel transported into the world, to being hyped during a boss fight, or even scared and uneasy in an optional zone that become my instant favourite.

If you are a fan of the metroidvania genre, Rusted Moss is a fresh take with a lot of fun challenges and upgrades to explore. I highly recommend the game, especially to those who ‘click’ with the grappling hook as it opens up the world in a way that I found exciting.",1.0

Now that I've finally played through it (just once so far, though I'm planning on replaying it to make different decisions), I find myself pleasantly surprised. The best Tron game I'd played before this one was either Tron 2.0 or Tron Evolution. I think this one is a lot more interesting than either of those, frankly. It's short, with my first playthrough clocking in around 2 hours, but there's definitely incentive to replay multiple times, as there are several decisions that affect the fates of characters and the roles they play in the story. And at $15, it's hard to be mad about a short runtime.

I really enjoyed the writing and the story here. I think this is the most existential and even political that Tron has ever been, and as a fan of the franchise, it's exciting to see a title that feels eager to dive deeper into the pre-established ideas and see what makes them tick. I saw on the writer/director's Twitter that they have multiple games/things already in development for the future of Tron, and if this is any indication of their quality, then I'm 100% on board.",1.0

This is the first piece of TRON lore that we have received in ten years!!! This is a great visual novel for players who love the genre, love TRON, or both. I'm still going through the game, but with my first play-through, I can tell that the writers took a lot of care and effort into recognizing and expanding on the intricate details of the TRON universe. 

However, the story is shorter than I would have wanted it to be. If you're a fast reader like I am, your play-through should take you 1-2 hours. Wish there was more to unlock and read. The $15 price does not justify this short length. 

Hopefully this is the only the tip of the iceberg for us to receive more TRON content. With the recent opening of the TRON Lightcycle / Run roller coaster at Walt Disney World and a third movie on the horizon, this is (hopefully) just the beginning.

HD version still proccesing!

This new visual novel is more of a romance story that is heavily focused on the stories of the characters present in it and I guess it tries to get the player invested in them too but, personally, I found it boring because from the start of the game all the dialogue was about your 3 friends and their inside jokes that I don't care much about (because there was no build-up to it, just loads of info about characters that I'm not invested in yet). Too much useless information and back-story all at once in the beginning (just my opinion). Other than that the characters look good and detailed, the story don't seem so far-fetched as it is in other visual novels, there are some animations and a lot of images. The price is kinda spicy but it seems that the devs want to release more episodes in the future at no extra charge.",1.0

Furthermore, I think there should be more settings, like the ability to change from downscroll to upscroll, as well as change the scroll speed like in normal rhythm games. It is also quite complex to learn the controls since you need to switch between different attacks while hitting different notes. I believe there should only be light attacks, heavy attacks, and blocks otherwise the gameplay would be too complicated since you would need to fight your opponent while hitting your notes with your other hand. Additionally, the mapping appears out of sync, especially in Vertigo. In order to preserve the true feeling of a singing competition between two great musicians, I believe more hard and upbeat songs should be added. I also find it strange that two people would be fighting while singing, but since that's the point of the game, I think it's fine. Moreover, I believe that different game modes, such as 4K, 7K, 9K, etc., should be added. As a conclusion, I think that hard charts and different genres of music should be added to keep the game from becoming boring and bland, and that more content should be added to allow players to discover what they're good at.

THE MAP:
The map is massive with nothing on it but roads. The world is basically just long roads leading to each mine with nothing in between. The garage/petrol station is a good idea but I didn't fill up the car once after the tutorial bit at the very start.

SOUNDS:
The sounds on this are just very bad...I muted my game when playing.

MINES:
All three mines are basically the same with nothing added to them (just a bigger area to walk across to sell coal). So this means that buying the other mines is a waste of time (you only have to buy them to get the achievement). 

WORKERS:
The workers don't actually work. 

MISSIONS:
At one point in the game the mission says "" Now you can build your coal empire"" and it basically stays the same no matter how much you earn, you can't advance any further than this. 

DISASTERS AND VEHICLE DAMAGE:
I am yet to see any disasters in the game which is indicated in the trailer, and no damage at all to vehicles (so it was pointless picking up the tool kit other than to fit that wheel at the start.....which you never have to do again.). If disasters and explosions actually happened I could maybe avoid that happening if I could actually buy a gas detector (The key command is in the menu but you cant buy one) and phones for the mines isn't working either which is also stated in the description.

It's worth noting that all of the battles in each run are interesting rather than the ""filler"" battles which many similar games feature.

298,298.0,298.0,298.0,298.0,136577403.0,1685730,"The game has a pleasing aesthetic and atmosphere to it. The journey takes us from colorful, vibrant landscapes, into medieval dungeons and murky swamps, which presents a welcome change of scenery and mood for each chapter.

The soundtrack is well done, each chapter has its own theme that fits the level and surrounding area, and the audio queues for being close to enemies or being spotted add some tension to the stealth gameplay.

The puzzles are well integrated into the levels, they're not too easy but also not very difficult, which makes it a chill experience while still offering a bit of a challenge. 

The stealth segments of the game have a good pacing to them, the levels aren't just extended sneaking sections, but a healthy combination of stealth and exploration with some puzzles thrown into the mix for some variety in gameplay.

I played with mouse and keyboard. The game is also compatible with controllers and joysticks. All controls can be remapped to your liking.

The game isn't very long. You can probably finish it in about 2 hours. I messed around a bit which lead to me spending close to 4 hours in the game. However, the game being short is definitely not a negative in this case. I think that overall the chill atmosphere and semi-challenging gameplay makes for a cozy experience on a rainy afternoon.

The game has some bugs in it, which is to be expected from a new release, especially one made by one developer and one 3D artist. Some of them have already been fixed in the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1685730/view/3719451786611878892] 1.0.1 hotfix [/url] that was released within a day of the launch.
Most of those bugs are and were extremely minor nuisances but nothing really game breaking. Most could be fixed by simply reloading the latest checkpoint, which the game has a good amount of, so you don't really lose much progress.

Cynthia comes across various collectibles throughout her journey, which offers some replayability should you have missed some. The ability to select and replay levels after completing the story would be a welcome addition, since there is no way to go back to get a collectible you might have missed other than starting a new game, which deletes your previous save.


What I didn't like as much was the dissonance between the character models. Cynthia, as the player character, has great quality model with physics and a neat selection of cool outfits to collect along her adventure. However, the other NPCs, while not looking too bad, are of noticeably lower quality than Cynthia. It makes sense to have the player be more refined than the NPCs we don't see as often and up-close too much, but it is still a bit jarring during cutscenes to go from Cynthia to an NPC.

The final boss fight was underwhelming and over before I knew it, I was hoping for a bit of a more elaborate final battle.
It sadly felt a bit rushed.

This one in particular seems to allow an absurd amount of customization in the way you link your weapons. It's really hard to explain in text and something that comes across better by just trying it out! Based on how you set up your links, your new upgrades can affect yourself, your enemies, your other weapons, or for example, your other weapons that proc off of hitting your other enemies, and so on and so forth (like an example - you can have a sword swinging from yourself, that inflicts poison on an enemy, that releases a nova burst every second, that inflicts a burn on enemies, which triggers something else to happen when it blows up, and so on).

I'm really not know all about Deck building game so I can't pointing out on if this is a good game for that genre or not. But I can given you a detail on what you'll get on this game.

- Deck building game: Everything is card, Including you and you companions.
- On your journey you can pick a cards  to assisting in your journey, So don't worry, You'll have a lot of cards.
- Which also mean you have to building your own deck. The card consisted of Weapons, Companions and Equipments. Playing each card will subtracting a turn on both you and the enemies. Any card hit zero first get to hit first.
- So its basically a game of wits where you'll have to manage the card you'll play before your team gets to hit  the enemies turn by turn. And trust me, Its not that easy at all. and you are going to losing alot.......This is where Rouge lite elements come into play.

1. At the beginning of each match, You'll get to pick 1 out of 3 randomize heroes.  Each will have different hit point and Health point. Also some of them will come pack with the effect such as Barrage (Hit all enemies in the same row) etc. etc.

2. You'l die. ALOT. Which if you are able to complete certain objective on each match. You'll progressively unlocking the building on your starting point. Allow for better equipment, companion and pets (And more)

So basically, This game is best because you can swooshing in and out for a quick rush and just leave when you thing just gone down hill and coming back later for better tryout. Its really fun especially when you just want to have something casual and still feeling serious at same time.

I played about 150 hours in the standalone years ago. I decided that I should start playing again because now it's on Steam. They have done so many quality of life improvements that you new players can enjoy. The bullcrap system with the ""mobile game"" like daily where you send your operators to collect stuff is gone. There used to be so many currencies you had to grind and now the only basic silver & fragments is enough with the premium currency. Grinding operators to get better before was insanely boring, tedious and annoying. Now it's simple and much better. Straight line and you just spend the free to play currency to activate new talents. 

Graphics are good and so are about 80% of the legendary operator skins. There are few goofed up stuff but rest are some old school gear and then some tactic00l af stuff. Pick the operator you like, read what their skills do and enjoy. Store updates weekly that which operators are on discount. 

To all new players, please play the tutorial. I play medic 90% of the time so please, don't run away from me. If you need the heals, go to the medic or stay near the player and if the skill requires a chain or AoE don't leave it. Don't spend your syringes that much since medic can carry 6, save your one syringe when it all hits the fan. 

I never liked the PvP and never gonna play it. I just love to grind the simple PvE maps and modes. 

It's not perfect though, the new voice acting in some maps that are totally redone with ""story"" cutscenes etc. is so abysmal that you may want to mute your dialogs. It is just disgustingly bad. Some random voice actor doing stereotypically bad accents. Should have just stayed with the vanilla voices like in the old maps. There are also some really meta operators for PvE which are just hilariously OP and can carry the whole match. Bourbon is disgustingly OP as hell with Kit. 

It is a good free to play game and it is improving more and more. Glad they improved so many quality of life aspects needed in the game, the previous currency grind made me quit but now I can just casually play again and progress.",1.0

After playing this game for a long time, and having a peak in Super Test environment I can tell you, honestly that this team isn't competent  and they blatantly lie. For example this year was supposed to be without any new units, however, they need money again so they're adding two more. They increased the price of everything, just to milk people dry.
Their battlepasses were around 40 to 60 euros depending if you want to complete it fully, and the mod team would make fun of COD for having 10 dollar BPs that were cosmetic, while Caliber had literal pay to win collections for over 30 euros..

I was once harrassed and DDOSED by the people i played against, provided literal video footage, however ScumbagJuJu who is the lead moderator, shut me up and never said anything to the russian players that literally attacked me verbally and my hardware.
Another instance was where i was unrighfully banned by a moderator, where he promised a certain channel, then acted dumb and demanded i prove it or he will mute me for a certain amount of time, when i did prove it with a screenshot i asked him does he need more proof or will he stop  eating shit, which he promptly muted. Of course he was scolded by ScmubagJuJu because he was in no right to do so, yet he did. 

The player feedback isn't listen to, believe me, for four years we put up with their lack of balance and bullshit updates to avoid doing anything. They release a new unit, make it broken, literally pay to win, milk them for a few months and then somewhat nerf them.

I've played every game mode, I have a decent amount of earned premium skins and all opeartors [besides the new pay to win americans and chinese] a lot of time spent in game as well. 
Their rules are so bad, you can get banned, now let me repeat, you can loose your account, for Tbagging an enemy and or friendly. That was also one of the questions i was asked when they asked me for super testing "" How would i feel if someone tbagged me"" where i answered i'd find it funny, cuz it's all in good faith and gaming fun.

There is actually 2 Endings to it so you can say you have to make a choice at somepoint 

Very Unique Game modes where you fight in 1 vs 1 against CPU in various levels

I found myself sinking more than 110 hours into it without even noticing how much time had passed. One of the standout features for me was the ability to choose from a variety of classes to create a diverse and dynamic party. It added an element of strategy and allowed me to approach battles in different ways.

Another standout feature was the warcamp, which was a unique and useful addition. It allowed me to manage resources, recruit new members, and interact with NPCs in a way that felt organic and immersive. I appreciated the option to choose between playing as a lawful character or embracing a more criminal lifestyle, which added a layer of moral complexity to the game.

Overall, Wartales is a fantastic game that offers a rich and satisfying experience. Its unique features and engaging gameplay make it a must-play for fans of strategy and RPG games.",1.0

344,344.0,344.0,344.0,344.0,136576847.0,1527950,"I'm really on the fence about this game. When I got it as the very early and incomplete version, it was awesome, arguably the best ""tactical RPG"" I know, even devoid of many features. But, as the versions progressed and the changes were made, it became worse. Today, probably hours away from release, it's... just another tRPG, I guess. With a couple interesting ideas and a number of annoying problems, just like most games.

The changes themselves are quite subtle. (sorry for long explanations, it's fairly intuitive when you actually play).
As an example, there is a very nice implementation of turn order: both your and your opponents' men are ""distributed evenly"" in the turn order for the round, so if the number of combatants is equal, you and enemy take turns acting with a single fighter, until all fighters act. However, for the AI, the order of its units acting is fixed, while you can act with any of your guys (who didn't act in this turn yet). While ""unfair"" towards the AI, it provides many interesting choices and tactics.
Now, if the enemy has twice as many people as you do, for each of your actions, they make two. So, even if you kill (or otherwise deal with) the guy who acts next (the obvious choice), another enemy will act after that and probably you'll be in some trouble. So, the difference in numbers turns out to be very, very important.
What did they change? Now, the number of your enemies is always quite close to yours, and in cases it somehow isn't, the extra units will arrive later (when you already killed many enemies) as reinforcements. So, the (rightfully dreaded) experience of being outnumbered is cut off from the game. Now, a lot of battles follow the same pattern: you neutralize the enemy who acts next, then he doesn't do much (or anything at all, if killed), rinse, repeat. A hundred of perfectly forgettable battles. 

I could write several such examples, including camp management, economy, fog mechanics. The early versions did convey the right experiences: you struggled to stay afloat with money, thoughtfully picked your contracts, took care of your men. But the updates made the game progressively worse. My best guess is, the game designers knew what they are doing and made bold (and really good!) decisions, but then some salespeople took over the game and made it ""accessible for wider audience"" or something - just another game.

UPD. The release actually happened while I was writing this. Congratulations! Despite all I wrote above, kudos for actually going all the way to the finished game, I know it's hard work.",0.0

It's a fantastic modern successor to the Turn based RPG games from my childhood, and I absolutely love it.

The developers are doing an excellent job of listening to the community and continually adding new content, which is very impressive. However, I have noticed lack of optimization issues with Nvidia, causing the game to stutter for few secs during your turn in combat. Playing in open GL mode reduces the problem, but I hope the developers add the Nvidia optimization to solve this issue.

There's so much going on in this game that I keep dumping long hours into it. Yeah, it's definitely not a fast paced game that everyone is going to enjoy. Some of the fights I've run into more early on in the game have taken long periods of time both in setup/strategy and because of the turn-based nature of the game. It'll take a couple of tries to get things right starting out and it's pretty easy to lose companions if you're not paying attention to everything that's going on.
Micromanaging your wages, food and companions' relationships is challenging and rewarding, making the overall hardcore feeling of the game much more appealing for players like me. Screw up positioning and lose your favorite archer, maybe save scum a few times to try finding a better starting position. There's a lot to soak up when you first start and there's definitely a bit of a learning curve, which makes it more entertaining and challenging.

Cannot wait to see where the game ends up going from here. Really enjoying what's there and I've only unlocked one other region so far, so there's plenty of stuff for me yet to do. I've tried a few groups so far and end up going back to the first one I created where I'm the furthest and in a definite money problem (though, I always forget to grab some prisoners - which is a pretty decent way to fund everything), sometimes a food issue, but my troop is getting stronger every time I sit down to rampantly play.",1.0

The fact that there is no initiative and any character can move when it's your turn (and vice versa for the enemy) feels silly. The starting positions in most fights also don't make a ton of sense to me. The talent trees are too shallow and it feels like some classes are much stronger than others. 

The 'campaign'/story is nice, but the battles become repetitive fairly quickly. I stopped playing sometime during the third region and haven't felt like picking it up again.

371,371.0,371.0,371.0,371.0,130149997.0,1527950,"The basic premise of the game is that you control a changing party of mercenaries and seek your fortune in a low-fantasy open world. As this is essentially the same premise as Battle Brothers, which I'm very familiar with, I'm going to compare the two in my review. I think a lot of people who will be interested in this newer game (still EA) will have already tried Battle Brothers, so such a comparison may be helpful to them.

Compared to BB, this game has a much greater sense of REALISM; every experience is more immersive. Instead of moving your party's icon across the map, you will see your group of members, complete with their beast(s) of burden and wagon(s), walking across the world itself. There are lots of points of interest in the world for you to interact with, including resource deposits to collect, groups of travelers of different factions, towns to visit, tombs to explore, etc. Most locations allow for you to search for things, sort of like a hidden object game. When you enter a town, there are multiple locations to visit, but they're a bit more involved than simply a menu with a list of options. Sometimes there are puzzles or quests involving multiple people, and in many cases you'll have to choose which faction to side with. Rather than hiring non-combat followers like BB, each of your companions can choose a profession which is very useful for the party as a whole; for example, you can designate someone to be a cook, which will enable them to cook recipes from food ingredients, and someone else to be a miner, allowing them to extract ore from mines. Most professions are associated with a mini-game; an angler has a little game in which you try to keep a fish on the line. The crafting system involves gathering resources from many sources: from town shops, from travelling merchants, from harvesting natural deposits, from skinning defeated animals; and then unlocking recipes that can be completed in your camp or in a dedicated workshop. The sheer number of things to do, and the way they all connect and benefit your team - it's a very impressive system. In terms of the fantasy element: if BB is a ""low"" fantasy world, this seems to be a ""lower"" fantasy world. If there is any sort of magic (beyond certain alchemy potions) or fantastic creatures (beyond a humongous rat) in this game, I have not discovered it yet.

GRAPHICALLY, the game outshines BB in every way. All people have full 3D models; all movements, battle skills, etc. are fully animated, and they're done so very well. I'm not knocking Battle Brothers here at all; it simply focuses on gameplay and doesn't endeavor to do a whole lot graphically, and people who enjoy it aren't looking to be wowed with graphics. That said, this game does, and uses the graphics for full immersion in a very impressive way.

The COMBAT is comparable to Battle Brothers, each having strengths and weaknesses. One of my favorite things about both games is that everybody can die. For real. For good. If you suck and let one of your guys die, they're dead. Gone. Bye bye. When I said your party is *changing*, that's what I meant: if you bite off more than you can chew, they'll be pushing up daisies in no time, and you'll have to recruit replacements. That said, combat in this game is *slightly* more forgiving, in that there's a mechanic applied to all your characters that essentially gives them the ""nine-lives"" perk from BB; that is, if they would be killed by a blow the first time, they survive it for a moment but will die for real if they take any more damage before they are healed. ""Healed"", meaning a realistic first aid skill that doesn't magically put them back to full health - it stops bleeding, burning, etc., and gives them a few hitpoints. A major difference between this game and BB is that battles are affected very little by RNG rolls; it rarely determines whether attacks hit or miss. (It does affect the order that enemies take their turns, as well as damage output for most skills.) Another major difference is that the tactical maps are not hex-based; they are based on realistic distances. Characters, depending on their movement ability, may be able to move up to, say, 10 meters. Positioning is very important, as different skills and weapons have different ranges (in meters). There are also natural hazards for certain tactical maps, such as falling rocks in caves, or lightning strikes during storms. (I actually find that these detract from the realism a bit, however, for two reasons: #1 in real life, they don't happen often enough to be a real factor in any battle of this size; #2, you get a preview of the AoE for these hazards before the turn, so you know exactly where and when they will occur, and you have plenty of time to get your guys out of the way.) In all, the combat feels very good in this game. I'm delighted to tell you that I screwed the pooch about 20 times before I finally figured out how to keep my guys alive.

Your COMPANIONS can be recruited from inns, from prisons, or other sources, such as solving a dilemma a certain way or completing a quest. You can also take prisoners and force them to do your bidding, including even taming most animals in the game and having them fight for you. Unlike BB, they have classes rather than backgrounds; the classes determine what options are available when they level up, so the customization doesn't feel quite as flexible as BB. You cannot equip any armor/weapon on any class. Only an Archer can use a bow, and he/she can't use anything else (that I'm aware of); in the event that they are forced into a melee attack, they can only use their fist to punch for a couple points' damage. The Ranger class is essentially a ""rogue"" from most RPG-type games. They can only wield a knife and an option off-hand weapon. I'm not sure why he's called a ""ranger"", as his primary weapon is not ranged and he doesn't really have any connection to nature or animals. As far as the uniqueness of characters' appearance, there are about 5 faces, 5 hairstyles, 5 beards, 5 hair colors, etc that you can choose from. So you can customize... just not a lot. However, companions can be either male or female, though I'm not sure of the full implications of this, or if it's simply an aesthetic choice. As you progress through the game, events can happen (like in BB) where characters acquire new traits or even promotions. When you hire someone, you don't know how exactly they will end up a month down the road.

PROCEDURAL GENERATION: This is the main area where BB triumphs over Wartales, as it has a fully generated, randomized world for each game. This is the main reason why I have over 4000 hours in it: it's hugely replayable. In comparison, the world of Wartales and most things in it were manually designed. RNG does affect some things from game to game, such as which items are available for sale at different locations, where/when some resources will appear, who will be travelling where and when, the order that quests will appear, etc. However, the world is otherwise a map of the same area from game to game. You can re-play the game with different characters, strategies, skills, and whatnot, and you can unlock different starting areas as you progress through the game; however, you will still be playing the same world, and you'll know all locations, stories, main quests, and decisions ahead of time, provided that you've discovered them before in an earlier playthrough. In my opinion, this is the only real drawback to this game compared with BB; but for me, it's a major one.

That said, this is a very fun, high-quality game with a ton of stuff to see and do and try out. What the developers set out to do, they have achieved remarkably. And it's still only Early Access - you can bet it's only going to get better as they continue to add more of the same.",1.0

Ware tales however is just difficult. Don't get me wrong, i enjoy a game that seriously stresses my mind. I wait with anticipation for Frostpunk 2. However when a game artificially makes its setting difficult for the sake of being difficult, no thanks...
Number of points.
1 Game economics are terrible. You can tell the economic capability of a game like this based of the craft cost. A crafted item should generally be worth more than the base components that went into it. This can vary if there is a price change due to quantity in a market (not for Wartales). When i went over the general prices for many crafted items, about 1/3 to 1/2 are just straight out less cost effective than their base components. This is disheartening to see at the start of a game. I didn't even factor in the general cost of acquiring the items in terms of party upkeep. You can grind the game out and make progress with the system possibly. That was just a massive red flag for me right away.
2 Combat is completely unbalanced. I know, people with tell me that it was fine for them, just use strategy, or if you do it this certain way than its just fine. A game like this should reward you for thinking tactically, not demand it. I don't enjoy spending an abundant amount of time strategizing on each tedious fight. Also if you are fighting same level enemies as you, the general expectation is that their capabilities will be the same. If the enemy can do double my damage at the same level and class, that's an artificial difficulty adjustment for the sake of being difficult. I don't enjoy it, and i don't enjoy being given paltry rewards for it. At least one wound at least per encounter for me, costing me at least 20 in craft good cost for a medicine, reward worth about 15 or 20. Just disappointing after the effort.
3 The story is lost in the survival. Any semblance of story that you might come across gets lost in the desperation to simply survive. You will make decisions based on your current needs more than on your morals at the start. Maybe this is the tale they are trying to convey. That life looses meaning when you stop living and just survive. Well they are right and that, in the end, is why i didn't exactly enjoy this game. I play games to live, not simply survive.",0.0

60 hours into it and have only fully explored 2 of the 4 (5?) regions available until now, the other 2 are almost untouched, yes I'm taking my time to explore and grow my group but still, that's a lot of content and things to do in a EA game. I'll probably take another 60hours to finish all the content currently avaiable and wait anxiously for more. 

The combat is very in-depth and even in Normal it's a welcome challenge, a lot of factors to take into account because each and every encounter is different, different mini-bosses, deployment and so on. Every single fight I have to think about what I'm doing, if I rush in head on even on lower level encounter I can get a guy killed. 

There is a lot of skills and especializations in the game, each of them bring something new to the table and makes you adapt to each situation depending on the guys you have. Nice crafting system, altough the weapons and armours you can craft gets pretty old when you reach lvl 6 and start dropping higher level stuff. They are still very much useful nonetheless. 

The only complain I have is the pathing system in the world map, you get stuck a lot but it's ok. I wasn't expecting to be so hooked up on the game since is EA, but the devs made an awesome game so far. It's well worth the price if you ask me, ESPECIALLY because the devs are apparently keeping up with the roadmap with almost no delays. I wholeheartedly recommend this game, in a era of awful and shallow AAA games as well as a flood of indie companies doing mini games to stay afloat, Wartales is gigantic breath of fresh air!

Wartales is a turn-based combat (XCom style) squad RPG, with a solid amount of content, interesting storylines, fun and challenging gameplay.  Unfortunately, there are still several bugs that range from mildly annoying to game-breaking.  By far the worst (at least on my system) is the chance to crash the entire computer upon entering any town marketplace (happens about 25% of the time), which also often corrupts both the auto-save and manual saves from that game.  I have one campaign 15 hours in, but due to that crash and save corruption, I can no longer play it.  Incredibly frustrating.

It's the classic formula of ""build up a group of mercenaries"", where you do quests, earn money, recruit more mercs and make them stronger, then use that to complete harder quests. Other games that I'd compare it to are Battle Brothers and Mount&Blade.

It's not quite finished yet, and this is especially noticeable in UI/UX, some content, and balancing. However, the core systems are all there and really fun.

42hrs in the first area alone.  
I felt like with the EA, I hit the limit with my team too quickly.  Got the hang of the whole, fight, run home, repair, eat, fight, run home, repair, eat, etc. fairly quickly.

As ambitious the concept of Wartales sounds like, I couldn't really feel emotionally attached to my team/character as I would in games like Kenshi, Mount & Blade, Crusader Kings, etc.  I didn't really feel attached to the mini-stories around the area as well.  I was excited to play the story of farmers wanting more with life but once I started playing, it felt like your backstory has nothing to do with how you play or how it dictates the world.  A game title like ""Wartales"" feels like a ""Play the way you want to with the backstory you want"" type game.  But this is just purely, fight, loot, repair, eat, sleep, repeat.

Oh, uhm.. once I figured out how to effectively and efficiently craft items for trade, it added an additional 10hrs of gameplay of renewed excitement realizing I could make more money by crafting from random loot and selling the crafted items. But then I hit my limit again once I managed to consistently stay over 1000 gold or so.

After all that and completing the first area and moving to the second, I felt like I hit a wall to play this game as it felt it's a rinse and repeat regardless of the region you're in or the background of your team.

Overall, this EA reminds me of other EAs I played where I play for a solid week or two and then hit a hard stop for many years as it just didn't feel wholesome or satisfying.  I guess I'll keep TRYING to play a bit more to see what else I can uncover..

I don't really thumbs down games but would definitely give this game a ""MEH"" for now.
Maybe other users have a more fulfilling and exhilarating experience instead?

Instead of thinking they cant switch, OFC the ability to move your fighters around is obvious but personally i didnt know you could switch fighters at will at the start of combat AND during combat aslong as they havent spent their action. Until i had played the game for a little while. Personally i think there should be a more "" DND "" aspect to the game where the initiative during combat will be based on skill ""and/or dice"" if you decide to implement that in the game.

Running on the world map should be a basic skill that you shouldnt have to spend points on in my opinion, because the fighters are grown ass men and women :P 

I also think that the cooking and the raw material production in camp should be increased to maybe 3 - 5 per rest, at least for a time when you start the game. 

Some paths in the game / on the world map, was pretty wierd to be honest :P

 SPOILERS AHEAD !!!! 

When you go on the mission to kill the colonel alex or (insert name). There should be a tutorial or atleast a hint that the player can plant a piton from their inventory manually. 

Also the mission to go into the ancient tomb or crypt, I only found the path to the place because i saw some random NPC's running in a wierd way down the hill :P but the torch ""preperation hint"" was good :)

It's stand out in many ways, it's a survival sim, as well as very immersive RPG. You are a band of deserters, bandits with the potential to become unwanted...or ??, or just some farm boys out for fun, that's just 3 of the 5 starting bands of 4. In the end you are mercs or bandits, or a trader, you can even be a cannibal with a pack of hogs you feed instead of regular folks. The game is very open, with lots of side quests, so much so that I don't want to spoil it as it's so new and so many are finding new ways to survive and explore. The devs also have a strong rep, and have produced some very good games, so looking forward to more content. Right now there are 3 provinces I have found,  trade is possible between them, but you will need to protect you goods. Another good money maker is bounty hunting, take prisoners and sell them, but there us a limit. The game is pretty well balanced and does not play like an EA at all, other than lacking voice actors it's pretty polished, the world is quite immersive with each province having it's own main story line....I think they all tie together, trade control seems to be a main motive? I have yet encounter any real bugs, though sometime I think i have, you can only sell bandits as prisoners...not the innocent folks you bash over the head and force into slavery because you are to cheap to buy another pony....but you will have to feed them. It's deep, and the turn based combat is too, like chess, skill and fore thought are required. in short BUY IT, best new game of the season. The only thing lacking is more provinces, and PvP, there is already an arena you can fight NPCs in so really hoping that becomes a PvP thing...with a full loot option of course, maybe even some Pvp provinces? Who knows? These devs have proven they can deliver what we want, the newest ""happiness patch"" makes the games so much better right off, that was direct and quick response to player feed back.",1.0

EDIT: Tutorial and tooltips have been added in the Comunity patch for December 2021. Once the autoleveling is addressed too, they will have my thumbsup

It's true. You currently have a lot of gameplay due the big map it already includes. You will really enjoy the early game once you have finished struggling figuring out how everything works, because it's not only there is no tutorial at all, it's that they have not even included tooltips or explanations for all the minigames involving crafting. 

And this is one of the cons I see in this game. It doesn't give you any feedback, you don't know any details about the character classes, which weapons they may use or what abilities will be unlocked when promoting one of your companions to captain or lieutenant. First times you promote someone it’s a guess game adventure, like getting a new crafting recipe for a weapon (no, brutes can’t use axes… seriously?).

The other big reason to not recommend Wartale right now there is no mid or late game content. You can only advance until level 5 and, after that, your companions will randomly get skill points whenever they get a nickname (it may occur several times for the same one and, guess what, the game doesn’t explain why or when nicknames are earned or changed). The only thing that escalates the game is the autoleveling of all the enemies around, which is only useful to generate more of the same with the difference that you will get combats of half an hour or 1 hour instead of the aprox 15 minutes during the early game. Spending almost one hour fighting superboars over and over again in epic battles is not fun, it’s repetitive and boring.

Nevertheless, there are around 10-15 hours of early game quite enjoyable and fun (learning process included). You should do the math if that’s worth 35 € EA for you… But do it in advance, by the time you have learned the game and have passed the exciting first date and start facing reality (the repetition of endless battles), you will not be eligible for a steam refund anymore.

This is a thoughtful, and well constructed game. Lots of role playing opportunities and great replay opportunities. My only complaint WOULD have been that the end game becomes a bit too easy, as your troop becomes a bit overpowered, but in the release they have made some small adjustments to combat and so this should be (if you are looking for a challenge) a great turn-based strategy combat.

506,506.0,506.0,506.0,506.0,136603177.0,1772830,"Rusted Moss is a charming game that oozes atmosphere, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But it has several problems. For a 20 euro game, it feels unpolished, like an early access title. I would honestly have preferred to pay 30 for a more polished version of this game.

The Bad:

First, the game is marketed as a twin-stick shooter. But booting the game up it told me to use mouse and keyboard, rather than controller. Using my PS4 controller, the game also doesn't show me correct button symbols, and does not let me bind certain controls to certain buttons (I have not tried using Steam's controller support for this game since many games reliably fail to show correct button symbols.)

Second, the game is marketed as a metroidvania. However, in playing it for six hours I found that the movement system, while rich and with a high skill ceiling, does not properly tutorialize several mechanics and does not properly encourage experimentation because of its difficulty. The level design does not adequately communicate which traversals are possible with the player's current skill set. With my disabilities, I found myself wondering which parts of the game I was 'allowed' to use the fly assist to bypass, and which I was supposed to be gated from entering for story progression reasons. Additionally, in six hours of playing and defeating three major bosses, I found a distressingly small amount of new abilities: the grapple, the high jump, a different gun, and grenades; there were plenty stat upgrades to be sure, but no genuine additions to the kit.

Third, the game is positively punishing in difficulty. This isn't a problem as such, but it is executed in frustrating fashion. The high-skill traversal system makes certain stretches between save points feel like unforgiving gauntlets, both because of the platforming and the enemy ecounters. This is exacerbated greatly by the fact that all progress since last save is lost upon death: all rooms explored, all collectibles found, all lost upon death. For certain collectibles, this made it harrowing to return to a save point.

Fourth, the combat system feels less than fun. The guns have great sound design and interesting firing modes, but the range is so short it feels like artificial difficulty. Since movement is so high-skill as well, this eliminates the greatest advantage the player would otherwise have: positioning. It makes regular enemy encounters feel like a hazard to avoid, in a game that hands the player a machine gun in the first ten seconds. Also the fact that grenades and healing use the same resource just serves to punish the player and disincentivize using the weapons available.

Fifth, there's a couple of minor annoyances. Mostly there are no genuine secrets to find, hidden walls and the like; but I have managed to find at least one instance of a genuinely hidden item close to the starting area, which felt very out of place. It is also possible to unintentionally skip non-repeatable dialogue, and there's no log of previous conversations to review in case that happens. For a game with such a detailed assist menu, it feels rather patronizing that the only option for circumventing platforming troubles is straight up flight; extra grapples in the air would have been a welcome addition, again like Celeste. Also the auto aim just plainly doesn't work.

The Good:

First, the writing. The character dialogue is execellent and genuinely funny. The worldbuilding is compelling and the story isn't front-loaded. Fern and Puck have a pre-established dynamic, and the story begins in medias res after an apocalyptic event, the details of which the player has to uncover. It is a refreshing work of fiction. (The only thing that frustrates me is how the grim tone clashes with the fact that the bosses are mostly left alive and hale for some reason. Would to me make more sense if they died in the battle, or at least were shown to be injured in some way in the aftermath, but that's a nitpick.)

Second, the aesthetic presentation. The graphics are gorgeous, the pixel animation style is well executed and feels nostalgically retro in all the right ways. I am in particular smitten with how each biome has a distinct color tint to the menu; very atmospheric. The animations are solid, the character design is varied and interesting, and the enemy variety is diverse despite all of them being machines. It reminds me of other great works such as Risk of Rain and Hyper Light Drifter.

Third, the music is wonderful. It sets the mood of each area without being intrusive, and it is definitely worth buying the OST download if you like listening to video game soundtracks.

Conclusion:

Rusted Moss is a action-horror platformer with exploration focus. It sets the player up against armies of enemies that the arsenal does not adequately address, and rewards avoiding combat and conserving resources more so than proficient combat. The story is dark, bleak, and apocalyptic, with the player fighting on the side of an inhuman, callously uncaring evil. It struggles with gameplay, but excels in story and visuals.

Loved Tron as a kid, have not kept up with any lore since the Legacy movie and felt lost a couple times with some of the language but it didn't effect my enjoyment of the game. My first playthrough was maybe 2 hours so it is a short game, however it is the brevity of the game that makes it likely I will replay to try and get a different ending (since choices I may have made contributed to a few too many deaths ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).
Music is good, graphics are Tronish and the story is a standard detective tale. Not entirely sure on how I feel about the puzzles, at first they didn't make sense but by the end they were pretty simple.
I think it was worth the $22 loonies it cost me but I can very much see how others will see it as overpriced.

But some things feel off:
- Mainly most of the maps I've played have felt really small for an arena based game, it often felt like I had way more movement than I needed for the scale of these areas. I know it wasn't an issue of movement because in the more open maps things felt fine. Side note for wall jumping: I think this feature is severely underused. I don't think there was a single instance where I felt that wall jumping would be useful or the better tech option over slide jumping. Just something to consider.
- Then there was the issue of the friendly AI: either the friendly AI is able to essentially play by itself (one flag CTF), or was pretty much useless (Control mode). I would find the AI just sitting in a corner doing nothing or bum rushing the objective and dying almost immediately. This forced me to have to essentially play both the role of offense and defense, though mainly defense. 
- The story thus far has been rough in its' presentation. Too much is thrown at you way too quickly, and my understanding of the world is nonexistent. Your character, Molly, literally spawns into the world and is immediately informed that she is some form of undead that has been brought back to life to compete in arena shooter style combat. Cool, great launch pad for some interesting cyberpunk/hackerman energy. But very quickly after your first clue that things are not what they seem, the story ramps up way too fast without any build up. You're introduced to a cast of character that you very quickly realize don't have a whole lot to do outside of being unique skins for the AI to use in combat. I got the sense that these characters  are supposed to be the main cast you're dealing with, but they have next to nothing to do or say - I just don't care about them. Only one of them gives off a memorable first impression and that's because you have to kill him in the arena. The story also introduces a character that further calls into question the things that have been going on, except the issue is that you haven't had a long enough time to actually see what things are normally like in this world to actually question what had been established. Going forward I would recommend that the story team be a little more patient with showing their hand. Just establish the world that Molly first spawns into: who brought her here, what is their reason, where is she, who are these other characters, what are the basic rules of this world? Let the player understand SOMETHING and have a reason to care about it before you try and subvert what you've established, or begin adding in stakes for characters that I don't have a reason to care about.
- This is my last issue, but it is related to story: the dialogue. It is often ROUGH. The tone is jovial and light, but it is entirely at odds with everything else. The humor is pretty shallow and frankly I wished it was toned down a lot. The dialogue between characters is pretty pointless. It gives you pretty much no extra information about the characters or the world. They seem entirely disconnected from everything going on around them.
- Final thing: The pistol feels off, I don't know if its damage or rate of fire (for either firing mode), but it felt wrong in comparison to every other weapon. Not a huge deal, maybe I just need more time with it. 

In conclusion: I like this game a lot. Playing the game was fun, and though the story hasn't impressed me, almost all of the elements they've introduced in the story are, or could be, really interesting. I have my issues but ultimately I want to see more. SO KEEP GOING DEVS! YOU GUYS HAVE SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL HERE :)

The mood detector is a really cool feature that I think adds a lot to the interactions, especially alongside the characters expressions and effects. The dialogue itself is interesting and you're given a lot of options to respond to characters with. Sometimes your choices aren't obvious, and I really enjoy that.

The music and the style of this game both come together really well to create very immersive, very good looking settings.

There were some issues based around the timed repairs. digging for the right component was difficult because you basically had to guess where they were located(since the pile of components wasn't very accurate to where the components actually were) and it got kind of finicky. The components sometimes awkwardly sat on top of things they shouldn't (Like the case of the gadget for example)

Plantera 2 Golden Acorn is the sequel to 2016's hit farming-style clicker, Plantera. But is the sequel as good as the original? Absolutely. I had dubbed the first iteration, Carpel Tunnel Simulator and part 2 is no different. It adds a few new elements like the addition of the grand tree with said golden acorns, but it's the same cozy clicker game, that in my opinion sh!!ts on Cookie Clicker cause Plantera is just a lot cuter.

Perfect for just turning your brain off to, with all the whimsy and clicking & for the low price of 4.99 USD- I cant recommend this game enough to everyone.

Just don't be a silly goose like I was. When you select the mission you're doing for a map, you can select all 5 difficulties, which I thought would unlock the prior goals as I completed them. I was wrong. For example, to unlock level 5 blacksmith upgrades, you need only survive 90 seconds and then kill 400 enemies. I've done this twice, but never got level 5 upgrades because I died before surviving 500 seconds following the 400 enemies. So I 'completed' the goal but died, nulling the goal. Thus, if I'd only selected the first and second missions, I would already have upgraded my weapons (some of them at least) to level five. Well, you live and learn I suppose.

There is also an amazing twist once you beat the final boss the first time, but I wont spoil that here.

The art is amazing and the music and sound design are just as good, so overall I would recommend this game, as long as it gets a few minor tweaks that I'm sure will be added soon.",1.0

I do think that maybe the balance needs readjusted a tiny bit - but it's not so bad that it makes me hate the game or not want to recommend it.

I definitely think it's a great game with great music, art, and gameplay... it's been released for a day since I wrote this - I am sure there will be balancing in the future or future updates in general.

About the Game:
• Gameplay: The mechanics have a grind-idle game style, so its a very relaxing-cozy game to play
• Graphics: Those pixel arts are simply adorable and respects and carry the model of the first version (thumbs up for that!!)

You can manage and build your own garden, the game pass a farming simulation vibe, once you start, you cannot stop, its a very addictive game!

You don't necessarily know exactly what you're going to encounter, but for the most part the enemies are very similar in each zone, and y. The art is cute and the musical composition is great (although several hours of hearing the same music will get old.) I do also appreciate how the mechanics are well-explained (if you right-click on cards) and enemy actions are always (with the one exception of [spoiler]Aimless[/spoiler] as well as [spoiler]enemies who explicitly have ""apply X to random enemy"" modifiers[/spoiler]) predictable. Same goes for your own turns.

The comments about balancing are somewhat unreasonable - this game hasn't been out even a day, much less had time for people to develop proper strategies for this. I had some exposure to the game from watching a streamer play it prior to launch, and you definitely can develop a strategy to go forward, even if it's not 100% successful. Yes, it's hard, and you die a lot, and there's RNG (like any roguelike), but it is one of those games that requires time spent to unlock more and get used to the mechanics to make your runs more successful. The RNG is primarily constrained to what cards/charms you get, as with most any deckbuilder.

To the devs: there [i]may[/i] be opportunities to change the balancing in the future, but please wait a bit and see what community forms around this game first before completely nerfing it.

The creepy secret side of things doesn't really feel very interesting and nothing took me by surprise sadly.

Movement is a bit rubbish too, but I can't really remember why it just feels ""off"". FPS is capped to 90 maximum too which is a strange choice.

In short, you can get a better experience by doing the following:

Watch a Mortal Kombat prefight cutscene
Load up a map Vs bots in UT99 and fight a bit until you hit 10 frags
Load up your favourite single player FPS and play that for 10 mins

PROs
- Great map interaction, full of little Easter eggs to find
- Fun game-like interactions with picking locks, solving puzzles, using skills, finding hidden objects by searching the screen with cursor etc...
- Large groups!
- Can recruit animals

CONs
- Hard to get going in the early levels, as your small party takes a beating and needs repairs and healing often; gets easier with more members as the overall damage gets spread out between everyone
- Combat gets tedious toward the end, and gets very lopsided with your band gets larger
- Each map zone has a different back story quest to solve, but over all they're identical in nature.  Main quest, side missions from tavern contacts, and random missions to stumble upon.
- Traveling the map is a chore with the length of day and having to rest... seems like you can't travel more than a minute before you have to rest again.  Really needs to be addressed as it's a big detractor from just trying to get around the map and enjoy the game
- Very simple combat system... armor is extra hp, and all damage types translate to hp damage.  There's no chance of missing/dodging an attack during melee, so you area always getting hit every time.  Each side trades turns until one side eventually has more people left
- Tedious having to constantly pay and feed your party, but camp site structures help reduce that headache
- Not a big mix of enemies
- You can buy pack ""ponies"" for hauling more gear, but can't ride horses to make traveling faster?!
- lack of in game quest guide tips, had to use youtube videos at times to figure out what was going on in some quests

I played this game on the fixed level option, so each zone had a set level range.  The starter zone was challenging to get going.  The second zone was fair, but after completing it I out leveled the third zone to the SW and quickly ran through that quest and all missions in a single round of combat every time (think I was lvl 5-6 and the enemy was level 3 or so.  By the time I got the the last zone in the east, I had already started to collect bears for fun, and ended up with 12 or so bears as they're more common on the harder zones (had wolves too but let them go as the bears racked up), and 14 other guys.  It ended up silly as the bears are absolute tanks with 1000+ hp, and can hit for 70+ damage and take up a lot of map space squares to provide nice meat shields for the rest of my party.  I could have just dumped all my human members except for a couple and a beast master, and just played the bears.  The good thing with having animals is you only need to feed them, not pay them, and you don't have to fully feed your group as the other camp bonuses make up for losing happiness due to lack of food.",1.0

People seem to dislike the difficulty but I think it's in a good spot. Unlike other deckbuilders your main heros hp does not carry over between battles, this means that fights rarely whittle your resources slightly so that you would die three fights from now at the boss. Instead there are less individual fights in a run, but you will regularly go from full strength to dead in a single fight. One or two misplays can kill you if you're not paying attention because every fight needs to be potentially lethal by design. Personally I like it, as beating the fights while killing all the 'treasure goblins' is fun in the early game. While beating the back half requires good deck construction and execution. 

The things that set this apart from other games I've played is the style polish and charm. The bells jingle, the characters move when you drag the cards around. The shopkeeps and town are adorable.  The art is very cohesive and gives the world a sense of whimsy. It puts a smile on my face every time I meet a new npc. Also the game is just fun.

It is taking the best of Slay the Spire but also from Rogue Legacy with our village to build up bringing further cards to build up your deck. However the main issue and I’ve seen other sharing this concern is the game is yet to be well balanced. Any deck building game you’re playing will make a you a hard time the first rounds but once you understand the enemies and your deck then you should never lose the first fights. But here you can because it will depends on what you get when you start. And because you got only one support for the first battle you can get overwhelmed very easily. I went through the third world (two boss fight won) and then I play again and loose again the first battle. So definitely some work to do but the ground is solid and this will be a must have once the balance has been fixed. Or maybe it will never be as this is something that can happen in Rogue Legacy too. Let’s see but I still recommend it. Great game overall.,1.0

Despite all this, at around 20 runs and 3 hours in, it has become clear that the balancing is abysmal. On my first few runs I just brushed it off to being new at the game, but after dying to the first battle in the campaign the first couple of times I figured something was way off, and it seems like this is a common issue to those that have already played the game. Even 
some positive reviews list it as an unbalanced mess

Enemies are numerous and extremely punishing. I enjoy having certain ""factions"" of foes, each possessing varying abilities and passives. You have enemies that focus on shielding themselves, enemies that use their hp as attack value and enemies that focus on debuffing. That being said, each enemy type requires you to have a certain ""answer"" to their skillset, which becomes a frustrating element of the game when you have such limited options to expand your deck and absolutely no way of knowing which enemies you'll end up facing. Got a build that focuses on attacking?  Too bad, for the next fight you'll be pitted against thorned enemies. Oh well, better luck next time. Having fights test the player's deck in different aspects is a great way of keeping the gameplay fresh but this is a ludicrous way of doing so. 

Let's also talk about the wave system in battles. The counter ticks down every turn to punish the player for stalling out fights which is a cool way of keeping combat fluid and engaging, but defeating enemies before the timer runs out just causes instant reinforcements anyway. With that in mind, the player's choice is between 1. Dragging out combat in an attempt to scale your team to face the army of threats aproaching and 2. Rushing the enemies to try and defeat most of them before you get overwhelmed. Not exactly a good way to reward quickly disposing of enemies since you get fucked over for doing so anyway.

Heroes being randomized was something that caught my eye when watching people playing the demo. After playing for a while, though, I wish they had stuck to a more basic approach instead of this messy implementation. Most heroes are delightfully useless, and serve more as a burden than anything else, since you're obligated to put them on the board. If you get unlucky enough with your draw, you might end up just dying outright to the first battle, before you even get a chance to modify your deck, which, albeit hilarious, is pretty bad from a balancing perspective.

The timer on actions was also a fun mechanic to mess around with and explore when I was starting out. However, this means action economy is terribly unbalanced (just as many, many other aspects of this game's combat). The mana system used in most modern deckbuilders triumphs greatly over Wildfrost's take, here, when it becomes painstakingly difficult to keep up with enemies when the players' actions are both costly and widely uninpactful. 

It seems wildfrost is trying to place itself as a challenging game, which I enjoy greatly, but there's also this feeling that the game is afraid of giving the player any agency. You have no reroll options, no chance to pass up a companion or an item (that I encountered in my short time playing) that'll bloat your deck or be left to gather dust in the reserve, and it makes me scratch my head and ask: ""why?""

Companions themselves (and heroes, for that matter) are largely designed to be brittle and fragile, as to make positioning and delaying enemy actions (or killing them outright before they even get a chance to act) important, but at the same time, the game makes them widely meek compared to enemies. You have heroes with whopping 7 cooldown triggers that dont even deal direct damage. You have pets, which are unique to the start of the game, occupying a slot that could be used for a companion later, which actively encourage you to trash them when you get better units.

 Most synergies that don't work instantly with your starter hero will be disappointing until more companions and items are in your deck (if you even survive to that point) that fit that particular role, and you're not even guaranteed to get any. Add this to the fact that you have a measly 2 slots for companions before you have to replace some, and also that you're not even guaranteed heroes that'll sinergize with anything and things will start to look bleak before you even start a run.

I could go on and on. Wildfrost's current state in balancing is apalling. I would ask for a refund if I could. I encourage anyone reading this to either skip completely or wait for a heavy discount. Of course, I'll edit this if things change, but even if I'm being optimistic, there's a lot, and I mean [b] a lot [/b], of work to be put in this game before I'd recommend it.

Game autosaves after every turn, so you physically can't save scum battles like in Slay the Spire for example. And you usually get severely punished for missplays. 
Sometimes a turn has too much going on and it's hard to plan your next move and easy to make a mistake, but when (if) you figure it out, it really makes you feel smart. 
Haven't noticed any ""unfair RNG"" that some reviewers talk about, skill issue in my opinion ;). 
Haven't been able to progress too far yet, so no comments on replayability.
Overall i love the game so far.
I've encountered a weird bug though...
***SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD***
[spoiler]So, after you win a run your hero gets possesed and your team becomes the final boss, right? 
I was about to finish my second successful run, but on the last fight my game consistently softlocked on one turn no matter what move i made. I was unable to continue and had to restart the game.
Might be a problem with custom enemies that i've created myself... 
After i had restarted the game a few times, i've finally made a very unfavorable move which eventually lost me the run. I guess i'll just try again later.[/spoiler]",1.0

It's a game that's similar to Battle Brothers, but with its own unique mechanics and graphics. While the genre is the same, the game feels refreshingly different and new.

What I particularly love about Wartales is its challenging gameplay. Although I will admit that it's slightly easier than Battle Brothers at the moment, the developer seems to be working on making the game even tougher, and that's something I'm eagerly anticipating! After all, what's a game without a good challenge, am I right?

I have nothing but praise for the game's management and fighting aspects. The game has a good balance between these two elements, and it's what makes it so addictive and enjoyable to play. I'm absolutely hooked, and I can't get enough of it!

As a hardcore gamer, I'm not easily impressed, but Wartales has truly won me over. I would happily give it a 9/10 rating, and I would definitely buy it again without hesitation. If you're a fan of strategy games and you haven't played Wartales yet, then you're seriously missing out!

Pros:
- Great art style with an amazing color palette and ""bloom"" or glowing effects from items and ambient set pieces
- Music is fun and not subjectively not annoying
- Character movement is smooth and effortless
- Very easy to earn tons of coins which in turn helps level up your character fairly quickly
- Combat is varied but in an old school fun kind of ""megaman needs to dodge energy balls"" kind of way, if that makes any sense
- Variety of enemies keeps you on your feet which can be exciting
- Power-Up's make you feel actually powerful but not OP which is a good balance
- UI is easy to navigate, includes plenty of language and customization options which is much appreciated

Cons:
- None of the purchasable powerups have explanations which would be nice before spending coins on them
- Certain powerups have a painfully long cooldown (I'm looking at you Snickerdoodle)
- The difficulty level is a bit rough too early in the game, getting to the 4th or 5th instance can be a bit of a challenge and should be a tad bit easier (level 1 and 2 should be a breeze for those possibly unfamiliar with these types of games)
- More lore would be nice even if the player hasn't seen the movie but this is just me nitpicking lol

Look, its an Early Access game for like what...5 bucks or something? Buy the damn thing and have some fun. It clearly needs some work but that's almost too harsh of a term, it needs good buff and polish job. IMO all the hard work was already done and it shows. This is basically a better looking version of Vampire Survivors with a bit less content is all. The game clearly doesn't take it self seriously and I love that, I'm here to have fun and accomplish something, this game lets you feel like you're doing that without trying to convince you that you're a vampire! 

Go have fun!

630,630.0,630.0,630.0,630.0,136606623.0,1527950,"I've been with this game for about a year, so into early access but not super far back, and seeing this game just get progressively better every new patch is great.

Pros:
-Combat is super fun. It can be really challenging at times, but not impossible to the point where it feels like you're climbing up a mountain. There's a lot of strategy, especially on the expert difficulty (which you should play on), and the enemy variety, as well as environmental factors and many other small things, makes it so that every skirmish is different. Each class have subclasses which amounts to a huge variety of combos you can run. You can have really dope synergies in your troop.
-Campaign mechanics, aka when you're walking around with your troop, picking up quests, feeding them, etc, is very satisfying. It's not super micromanagement heavy, but you still need to pay attention to your ressources, your troop's happiness, your relationships, food and gold so your playthrough doesn't go haywire.
-Graphics are good and very consistent. The style of the game is nice to look at and each area has something new to look at. most areas will look different, combat animations are very crisp and have a lot of girth and power behind them, and extra things like weather look good to.
-The devs are super proactive and responsible. They constantly listen to player feedback and they're on top of patching and updating the game. Major respect for that.

Cons:
-The game doesn't really have a main story. If you want a story driven game, this ain't it, because this is one of those 'make your own story' games. The lack of a main narrative doesn't really upset me personally, but not having characters or a plot really takes away from choices you have to make throughout your playthroughs. It's not that big of a downfall.
-Difficulty scaling in this game can be a little weird at times. For the most part, I think the difficulty is pretty reasonable (it also depends on the difficulty your playing on). However, it's very easy to get absolutely dumpstered early on by enemies that you really shouldn't run in to. Even in the mid and late parts of the game, some fights like arena challenges are pretty unfair at times, sometimes warranting the acquirement of some legendary weapons or serious levelling up to stand a chance.
-It's not as big of a problem as it used to be, but foraging for resources on the campaign map is still a little janky at times. Sometimes resources spawn outside the map or in impossible to reach places, and your troop's movement is very sensitive. It can be really annoying at times when you're trying to go up a hill but there's a small bit of impassible terrain in your way and your troops completely ignores its move order. The devs are aware of this jankiness however and i'm certain this will be addressed more in the future.
-Relationships in your troop happen passively overtime, whether your guys are saving each other's asses, drinking booze together by the fire and joking, or doing the opposite and cursing each other out, fighting one another, etc. It's cool, but it really doesn't change much in the game. You get small bonuses if 'friends' are next to each other, but the damage bonuses are very small and aren't super noticeable. From the start of my longest playthrough to the end of it where my relationships started at 0 until I had a troop of 23 guys who all loved each other, I could hardly tell if relationships had done anything. Hopefully they're changed to be more prevalent and actually affect the troop more seriously like in Darkest Dungeon 2.

These cons are very minor and in a few months time, I bet they will have been addressed by the devs already, so take them with a grain of salt. The fact I can only think of these minor negatives about Wartales says a lot about how fun this game is. Definitely worth the purchase, even at its full price, and if you see it on sale, 100% grab it if you're even slightly interested.

I really enjoy how natural the tutorials feel in this game; rather than a dozen text-filled popups per minute, it explains things briefly as they happen organically in a playthrough (e.g. the ""dying"" mechanic only gets introduced and explained once one of your characters is dying. Ability descriptions might mention it, but, until a character of yours gets the ""dying"" status, you won't know exactly what it entails).

This made me hesitant to buy the game at first, but I got it anyway and I'm glad I did.  I disagree with the complaints.  People who think this game is too hard have probably never gotten an Ascension 20 heart kill in Slay the Spire.

I only have about 4 hours in the game so far.  Maybe it will scale up in difficulty as I progress, like Slay the Spire did.  I have finished 2 runs and the game has been quite fun already.  I didn't find it to be too difficult; in fact, on my first blind play-through, I reached what was probably the final boss.  I lost to him because I didn't understand his mechanics, but I think I understand them now and that defeating him should be quite doable.  I think I could have won on my 2nd play-through, but I was playing at 2 AM and due to tiredness left my leader in front of the boss's 50 damage attack when I had plenty of ways to prevent that from happening.  I think I definitely would have won otherwise.  Either way, not bad for a 2nd play-through.  

All that is to say, I don't think this game is too hard at all, and I think it has a lot of interesting synergies that I am eager to explore.  If you have ever gotten an Ascension 20 heart kill in Slay the Spire, then ignore all of the negative reviews complaining about difficulty and balance.  The same can be said if you've ever gotten a max covenant win in Monster Train.  

This game has pleasant art and sound design.  The way you play cards in rows is somewhat reminiscent of Monster Train, but there are other aspects which make the game play feel quite unique, like only playing 1 card per turn (mostly, unless you have a specific buff on a card).  

I'm glad I bought the game.  I have played enough Slay the Spire (about 500 hours) and Monster Train (about 200 hours) that I have been burnt out on both of them several times.  This game scratches the itch for a rogue like deck builder and is unique enough to feel fresh and exciting for me.",1.0

This is a very short early access release. First episode or not, it's more of a decent-sized demo than anything. I'd say it's worth keeping an eye on, but you may want to hold off for a little while unless you really, really want this to support this right off the bat.
What Ghostware: Arena of the Dead is not is a traditional single-player FPS. As it stands, it's more like a series of bot matches with the odd campaign level or mid-level event here and there, and after you clear an arena, you revisit it and look for secrets. Some of these secrets directly give you upgrades, but most give you links to fictional websites you visit through your in-game browser, and it's through these that much of the story is told.
This is what distinguishes Ghostware most right now, and in my opinion it should lean even more into this than it does at the moment. When it does, it has this atmosphere and sense of mystery and discovery that the game's more traditional cutscenes and dialogue lack. It's teetering on this strange line between just okay and potentially really, really distinct and memorable. This is a game that needs to go all the way, do weird stuff, and take risks if it wants to succeed. Break the ""game,"" throw unfinished level geometry and out of bounds areas at the player, feed him a bunch of links that may or may not have much to do with the plot, really, just spitball a bunch of weird shit and focus more on that than polish and traditional game narrative.

Some of them include deck checks that are complete bs if you don't know they're coming. It's one of those games where you spend the entire time thinking, ""How do I lose?"" instead of ""how do I win?""

Some events like the muncher (thins your deck) and charms (too easy to get something useless for your deck) sound good but end up being noob traps because having a follower synergy is way more important. Now those events wouldn't be useless if the campaign was longer and you actually had some time to refine your deck, but you don't.

There's a lot of reviews already claiming this game to be too hard or have difficulty spikes. I don't mind when a game is challenging, if anything i prefer it, it keeps things interesting and engaging. 

This game however does not feel challenging, it feels unfair. I rarely (if ever) feel I could have made different choices to have changed the outcome upon defeat leaving me with little to nothing to learn from. The way the enemies are balanced, their abilities and base stats, feels as though they expect you to have a powerful build put together by the time you get them but provides so few ways to manipulate your deck building to create a deck with enough synergy. Even in the few times I DO get solid deck together getting through an encounter is sketchy at best.

There's a lot of potential here though. Some adjustments to the games balance whether it be providing more deck manipulation, weighted synergy RNG, or reduced enemy numbers could very easily bring the game into a great spot and change this review.

I would place this game on the same level as those games easily, and especially if they address some of the issues I mention below. 

The game overall is extremely polished. The combat is unique to the genre with dynamic positioning options, card selections and manipulation, and tons of emergent gameplay with the mechanics interactions. Lots of decision-making and thought involved in your play patterns. Really creative ways to pilot your units and give them synergy.

I will echo what other reviewers mentioned though, which is that the runthroughs can feel really feast or famine. There are some issues:
- Enemies that force 'Aimless' onto your allies or have Aimless themselves feel very unfair, forcing your units to attack into thorns or other detrimental effects or to possibly get sniped by enemies. I think like 50% of my runs ended to Aimless RNG.
- No option to decline card additions or hero additions.
- Starting heroes can be very very bad with not many ways to salvage them.
- No ways to mitigate bad RNG--not enough removal options. Maybe put discovered charms in the shop at a higher cost (Slay the Spire does this with relics and its a nice touch). There are a lot of charms that feel completely useless.
- Limited path branching means not as much agency with map nodes--would like to see that expanded to have more choices.

They mostly complain about game balance, but the game offers a lot of powerful mechanics to the player, and challenges presented feel very reasonable, usually only requiring a shift in strategy to address. Think Slay the Spire, that game is brutally difficult and is beloved for it, this game is in the exact same vein. Yes it's hard, but it offers so many ways for the player to succeed. Clear example is the companion Yuki, you can easily buff him to have more than 30 attack (heck much more in my experience) simply by spamming frost, this is enough to kill most bosses in one hit. He's too squishy for a particular boss? Give him shields. Low on health? Recall him, the attack buff stays for the whole combat. Anyways my actual review is below.

My experience playing this has been absolutely great. First of all I love to see a fully complete game being released, it's surprisingly uncommon these days. Past that the game oozes charm and is extremely fun to boot. I'll lay out some pros and cons, but generally if you like card roguelikes and the art you'll love this one.

Pros
- Absolutely charming art
- Fun characters
- Unique and interesting card roguelike format
- Card effects feel varied and unique

For positives the the visuals/music are amazing, and I love the character designs. Everything is just so bright and color, definitely stands out compared to the likes of Monster Train and Slay the Spire. Though in a game like this I feel gameplay is the most important part, and this game stumbles rather hard on that front. You either get an amazing combo within the first 1-2 areas or you die. It ramps up far to quickly most of the time, to the point where most strategies don't work because you can't wait to get the cards you need. Either the card works now or you die, with rarely any inbetween. Hell you can get an amazing combo and still die thanks to the enemies just hard countering your strategy. Have fun with that barrage build when the enemies have nothing but teeth. There are plenty of interesting ideas don't get me wrong, but there really needs to be some work with this. I'm sure they'll patch the game to make it better, so I recommend holding off until so.",0.0

 However, I could not get past the puzzle aspect and immediately wanted to skip it after the first play through.

It became rather tedious and frustrating, and as the story got closer to the finish the puzzles got longer instead of harder.

 To tell the truth I never even learn how the puzzles worked until the very end of my second play though more out of curiosity then need.  It was faster to just connect the dots so to speak then try and figure out the puzzle.

Oh and did I mention PvE? Yeah, you can play short missions against bots, they are not as good as Insurgency, but again, not bad for a free game.
As far as MTX go you can buy operators, skins (skins give bonus exp) and a premium sub that gives more exp/credits.
Higher level characters seem to be a bit better, but I haven't played enough to know how good/bad the balance is.

this is my first game review but i wanted to make one for this game as i really hope it gets some love and i want to share how much i enjoyed this game and hope its a sign of more Tron games to come 

I'm a big fan of the Tron IP and it's such a shame that so little is done with it in terms of games. So when i heard they were making a VN detective game i was so excited as its a part of the universe we don't see much if at all and i think this really delivers that experience 

Set in a separate area from the movies lets this stand on its own, even though we got a short time with these characters we still learn alot about this world and how it has and is still evolving and changing, the talk of past wars, enemies and friends, new factions and ideologies. I want to talk more and spend more time here.

The game is short and i can see people getting annoyed with the puzzle gameplay but i found it a nice change of pace.

I wouldn't pay too much attention to the players screeching because they haven't won a run yet, seeing this complaint a lot recently on more difficult roguelikes.  Dudes with 2 hours in a game expecting to be cruising through everything is laughable.  I personally get excited when a deckbuilder makes me sweat.

The gameplay is quite original. I spent a lot of time on Slay the Spire, which is also a Deckbuilder/Roguelike, but it has a completely difference turn system which is very fresh. Each action has a great impact on the game, and you need to think wisely about if using that card is worth a turn, or not.

Graphics and musics are just perfect. I'm a sucker for this art style.

I see a lot of people posting negative reviews because of balancing problems. I can agree that some mechanics are clearly more powerful than others, but that's also the fun of it, discovering what works or not. I'd like to see corrections and new mechanics added in the future, but for the time being, I think it does the work well enough. My only real critic would be that we have too little control over the contruction of our deck. More ways to banish a card or reroll a treasure would certainly be a nice addition.

It is quite a difficult game, that's for sure. I don't see it as a negative though, quite the opposite. Just take that into consideration if you're not a big fan of struggle.

777,777.0,777.0,777.0,777.0,136621393.0,1811990,"I have to echo many of the sentiments of those who have had issues with this game. I want to love Wildfrost, the graphics and presentation are just utterly amazing. The charm that this game imparts is something that keeps drawing me back to play another run, but the immense number of balance issues prevent me from trying this game any further. This is sad given that I absolutely love this genre, and would've loved another game to sink more time into, but in its current form, I cannot recommend it.

Balance issues are as follows:

1. Heroes are generally pretty bad: The heroes that you get to select at the beginning are, more often than not, underwhelming and completely eclipsed by the enemies you'll face, both in terms of health and damage output. This makes the early game significantly more difficult as I found that I was always leaning towards the tougher heroes and neglecting the ones with special abilities, simply to ensure that I had enough output to keep up with the games difficulty ramp.

2. Most companions, charms and treasures are either bad, or just actively make your deck worse: Building a deck around some kind of strategy becomes either rare, or nearly impossible when the choices of companions you're presented with are basically unplayable, or don't meld well with your existing deck. The inability to 'skip' a pick, means you're forced to actively add cards to your deck that make an already bad deck, worse. The charms are all over the place, and the fact that you only get a single charm to pick from when you find them in the dispensers means that quite often you get less out of the route you take then you would otherwise need to keep up. Many of the charms are just straight up bad. I only once in all my runs managed to put some kind of coherent strategy together, and even then it wasn't enough to beat the run.

3. Enemies swarm you: It didn't take long me to realise that this games balance has some serious issues, particularly when waves of enemies keep spawning at a rate far greater than your ability to dispose of them. Given that many enemies can act faster, have more health, and even hit harder than anyone on your team, it makes the swarming even worse. Most of my runs ended because I simply couldn't keep up with the sheer number of enemies that were appearing on the screen. When the mini-boss of each stage appears, if you haven't sufficiently dealt with prior enemies, it can make the game unplayable in terms of difficulty.

I enjoy a challenging game, and don't mind taking the time to learn how to play these better in order to overcome the difficulty, but Wildfrost's balance makes any attempt to trying to do that seemingly pointless. Beating this game seems to come down more to RNG with card choices, and charms then it does with the actual skill of the player. Either you lucked out on an extremely good deck, or your run is just dead.

For the above reasons (and many others that have been mentioned in other reviews), I cannot recommend Wildfrost.",0.0

Game is awesome. The pixelated style is a common choice for these roguelite games, but the combination of the music, the animations, and the sometimes goofy moments makes me wonder what the movie will be like. Which...is probably what the developers want, but I have to say, they do it well. So whatever gripes I may have being advertised to by a videogame are all unimportant since it worked >:)

Some visual/gameplay issues I noticed. Hitboxes are not very defined. I can sometimes get right into an enemy's face without getting hit, and the others it feels like I got suckerpunched from nowhere. And that is just the melee enemies. The enemy bullets are hard to keep track of. I had a buddy watch me from the side and with all the shimmying about I was doing to hit the enemies, I neglected the bullets that were apparently obvious. Now, that might be my ADHD at play, but I was definitely getting better about avoiding most of the onslaught of projectiles. Another issue is the controls. Not having a cursor from your mouse made things a little wonky in the menu screen. At first, the game crashed on exit, but it seems that was fixed pretty quickly. Also, don't expect to win...for some time. Or maybe I am just bad at the game (:

Ideas for the future? I am not going to tell the developers how to play the game, but some things I had questions on are how hard it is to understand anything. For example, the Victims you are to save or kill...I think an achievement is related to this option, but I can't determine how to go about it. I both saved and killed the Cheerleader in the first level with Renfield, but there was no obvious difference in result, save for time remaining upon reaching the boss room and the amount of money that was rewarded. Is money going to be more important in a future update? Also, the shop was a little surprising. It took me a bit to realize there were other tabs lol. Also also, the coffin was something I wasn't sure what it did until I realized I had to buy it multiple times. I had thought its effect was an upgrade I got in a run.

All-in-all, the game is hectic, visually stimulating, probably a good game to watch for streamers, and if this is just the beginning, then I am looking forward to what the developers bring in the future.

I will keep playing just to see if beating the levels in both Feed and Save options for both playable characters will do something. Then I will play to see if there are good synergies.

Keeps opening in the wrong monitor, doesn't seem to recognize which monitor is monitor 1-3 but also upon loading or quitting shuffles everything on monitor 1 to monitors 2 or 3. No other game or program does this so it's obviously something to do with this game. On top of that it locks up and crashes often. Sometimes at the end of a battle you try to click continue and it'll sit there for 5-6 minutes before giving you the reward and allowing you to continue. Sometimes it just locks up entirely and you gotta reload before the battle and replay the whole thing. Hope you saved because the auto save overwrites itself. On top of all that it encrypts all the values to prevent people from cheating in a single player game. Annoying and dumb design decision. Let people cheat in single player games if they want. 

Wait a few weeks/months for the bugs to be fixed. Absolutely don't buy if you use a multi-monitor setup. It's an exercise in frustration using 3 monitors. Given how often it crashes it absolutely needs multiple autosaves and shouldn't just overwrite the exiting one into state where it crashes when you click continue at the end of a battle.

Got a guy that gives teeth (damage when hit) to all his teammates but he's sat at the second row (behind someone else I have to kill first to hurt him). My range cards do two damage and has 14 health.

In most games, of this kind, such as Slay the Spire, you get like 30 choices of cards to add to the deck, events to get things that change your playstyle etc. over the course of a run. That gives you the ability to minimise the effect of RNG, so you can strategise and make the most of a bad situation if it comes to that.

This game gives you about 9. This means the enemies ramp up quickly and so the only successful runs will be the ones where you get extremely lucky. There's no chance to mitigate bad RNG. You just don't get the opportunity. You have to hope every time you get a card or charm that it's the exact one you need.

No Premium = 27,050
Premium = 38,850

To get all operators for a class is:
100,000 x 3 = 300,000 credits
150,000 x 5 = 750,000 credits
200,000 x 6 = 1,200,000 credits
All together = 2,250,000 credits
(This isn't counting the 4 operators that could only be obtained through a previous battle pass)

So to get all operators for a class as both a non premium and premium player (Remember this game has 4 different classes)
Non Premium - 2,250,000/27,050 = Approx. 84 days of daily challenges
Premium - 2,250,000/38,850 = Approx. 58 days of daily challenges

If you wanted to buy these with coins (the premium currency) operators in this game cost either 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 coins depending on credit cost of operator (shown above)

Prices for coins:
2,250 coins = $11.99
5,000 coins = $23.99

I get it as a free to play developer you need to be making money but if you don't really give a decent incentive and give people the opportunity to unlock stuff in your game within a somewhat timely manner then this might knock a lot of people from wanting to play a game

Like I mentioned at the start the gameplay of this is really fun has a nice ghost recon feel to it and this game could really be something good but please look into what people get with their time

After 100+ hours in FX on Epic and 100+ hours in FX3 on a lot of the same tables, the new FX is my go-to platform and the one I see myself playing long into the future.  

The difference is all in the physics.  There's some visual upgrades for sure - which are actually a mixed bag at the moment, because while the game looks great, it's wildly unoptimized - but what's important in pinball is how it /feels/, and FX feels fantastic.  To compare the two, FX3 is fun and springy, easy and arcadey, while FX, to me, feels like far more like playing real pinball.  It's more challenging and realistic, more unpredictable, faster and less forgiving.  The default competitive mode is ""Classic"", which allows you to play for scores and excludes the powerups that were a necessity in the default mode of FX3 if you wanted to top the leaderboards.  If you're still after the powerups, you can find them in ""Arcade"" mode, but ""Classic"" feels great in my hands, and if you want a challenge even above that, there's ""Pro"" mode on each of the Williams tables with a steeper playfield and tougher rules.  

This game is imperfect, and a work in progress (please add proper Ultrawide support!), but it doesn't deserve to be drowned out in negative reviews.  I'll update this with some more detailed thoughts, but if you're any sort of a pinball fan at all, ignore the hubbub and give FX a look.  You'll be glad you did.",1.0
835,835.0,835.0,835.0,835.0,136622979.0,2328760,"Having played many hours on Epic, I'm so happy to see this launch on Steam. The biggest draw to Pinball FX is the updated physics system coming from the prior entry, Pinball FX3. While much of this may feel minor at first, the ball behaves far more consistently across different tables and the challenge on the non simulator pinball tables (i.e, Zen Originals and franchise crossovers) is much faster and weighty. Graphically, it is a solid improvement if you have a capable PC. The ray-tracing is nice, although not mandatory. It is much improved over its early access performance, and I now get around 90FPS with max graphics settings at 1440p with ray-tracing enabled. Hey, it's just nice to see those reflections on the glossy board :-) 

The elephant in the room is the lack of DLC carryover to the new platform. While unfortunate, I believe this is a passion project geared towards enthusiasts. Recreating each table takes time, so does implementing ray-tracing, updating lighting, and ensuring all of the prior systems work with how the ball and flippers now behave; this is no small feat. Given the DLC packs which discount purchases of updated tables if you already own them on PFX3 (See the legacy bundles), I think it is fair. Zen have provided multiple ways to discount tables and assist long-term players in the transition to the new system. 

No, you don't *need* to update to Pinball FX if you are happy with Pinball FX3. Keep your purchases there and keep enjoying the game! Those tables are still great. However if you are an enthusiast, you will enjoy playing these tables with their updated physics along with the already hefty amount of new content. I have particularly enjoyed Wrath of the Elder Gods, Grimm Tales, World War Z and the new William's tables (Addams Family, finally!). 

Two thumbs up from me. Zen have really pulled through after their rocky launch on Epic and I'm excited to see how this platform develops for years to come. Between the Punishinly accurate Williams simulations, the video-gamey Zen Originals and numerous franchise crossovers, I believe Pinball FX has truly become THE hub for Pinball, no matter how you engage with the game.",1.0

Even though the point is obviously to survive the 20 waves, it still feels more of a pointless endeavor than other games within this genre. It may be because the enemies are all autopathing looking like they are in a MOBA going to a tower, but they are just doing large loops around the map I think, with no destination. 

There are good bits that, if changed quite a bit, may be fun in the future. But I think the majority of positive reviews currently posted are probably less than genuine. I would have returned it even for the $3, but I took my dog out for a walk and didn't see I left it on for 2.5 hours.",0.0

The player is offered a traditional bullet heaven control scheme, with WASD or gamepad stick usage and fixed camera, or one closer to MOBAs with the mouse doing all the heavy lifting. It's all about sidesteps, avoiding enemy attacks, traps and more, with a handful of enemy types roaming on predetermined paths as the mobs in a MOBA unless the player bothers them. Unlike the waves of Vampire Survivors clones, Sidestep Legends barely features any attack that can be used to damage opponents while moving, so players will be required to keep switching between moving and standing still, to dodge and to attack respectively. This is a fun take on the genre for sure, as it adds an extra layer of strategy and decision-making, on top of a higher skill ceiling.

The issue is that it doesn't really feel too rewarding. The enemies are not very varied, and they pose a challenge pretty much only because the player has to stop to fight them, with an initial attack range pre-upgrades that is quite laughable. The base attacks and speeds are also superlow, though upgrades make them a lot more satisfying eventually. The map has XP gems and coins spawn all across, with even treasure chests and challenges filling in the blanks, but often these happen far away from enemies who, remember, follow predetermined paths. The game actively pushes you away from the action a lot of the time, with traps like gas waves, fire areas and hooks pulling the player back for extra challenge. This is the game's incentive to have the player moving... but again, you are supposed to stop to attack, which means that most of the time you will not be attacking, as it doesn't take long before you are looking at a couple dozen enemies and traps are spawning everywhere. 

Couple all this with fairly unimpressive 3D visuals and a skill tree that's packed with tons of expensive yet minor upgrades, and I just can't say that I truly enjoy or want to recommend this game yet. Even when the upgrades become more satisfying, some higher level skills and characters are unlocked and you're battling against a giant boss, at its core Sidestep Legends feels like you're fighting against the game's design trying to slow your every move and attack more so than the hundreds of identical minions you encounter in a run. A good bullet heaven and a good MOBA both make you feel swift and powerful, and unfortunately that feeling is too rare here for me to recommend the game as of now. I plan to revisit it in the future because it's still in Early Access and I believe the concept can achieve a lot more with some balancing and design tweaks.

First off i've got to address the sound design which is absolutely amazing, for example the sounds from outside of your helmet are muffled in a fantastic way. Gun sound powerful and the boosters make my ears moan.
""but space doesn't have any sound"" you're free to take off your headset at any time, you'll see how fun that'll be.

The Graphics are really good too, not out of this world but not bad either.

The Gameplay feels good: the TTK is quite quick but not too quick and the weapons feel great and powerful.
The movement has a slight learning curve too it (not negative) since you can turn in all directions in anyway which can make you loose orientation, but you do get used to it.

So basically you have a clone (visually) to world of tanks, now you remove ALL of the armor/hit/bounce/pen mechanics. Replace it with two hitboxes per tank, and the tank is hit in Box A (The front/top/front 90% of the sides) that tank takes 50% of the damage done by the gun. If the round hits Box B (The rear and the back 20% of the sides) it takes 100% of the damage done by the gun.

That pretty much sums up the general gunplay, very arcade'y. The game does stir things up a bit with equipment which acts as tank abilities. (Some tanks only have access to certain ones.) Which can set things on fire, place landmines, repair, debuff enemy tanks, buff your tank, etc. And they can be used repeatedly with a long cooldown.

The actual gameplay mechanics make less sense. There are bases for each team, and they can be captured. But they serve no purpose currently, they don't win the match, they don't prevent enemy respawns, they don't get points, nada. Broken/missing mechanics basically. Also players can respawn into ANY tanks they have left after dying, so matches can go on for a LONG time with each player having like 5-12 tanks eventually, there is a time limit however.

Ok, so onto the bad. The game sells pay2win to some insane levels. decals/camo even give SUBSTANTIAL damage buffs. (like 10% each) There is also gold ammo, but since there is no armor pen/bounce system, it just straight up does +50% damage AND randomly disables any tank shot with it briefly. If you have it, and someone else doesn't, you automatically win ANY shootout, even if your in a light tanks and they are in a heavy tank. There is also pay2win equipment, pay2win premium tanks that are +30% stronger than the normal ones. The list is a mile long on the Pay2win.

98% of the enemy tanks are also bots currently. Very few players. The A.I. is pretty good though and acts like a only marginally mentally retarded player. They will also ALWAYS target you immediately if you shoot them, even if they are in a 9-way melee range shootout and you snipe at them from a mile away, they will immediately ignore everything else and fire at you. Making the A.I. effective at killing YOU, but not good at winning a match.",1.0
861,861.0,861.0,861.0,861.0,136637589.0,2318550,"A straightforward action game where you must eliminate enough enemies to advance to the next level. 

Despite the fact that the game is marketed as a shooter, melee scythe attacks end up being more effective because they hit with a broad swipe. Furthermore, the controls don't operate in a twin-shooter fashion, making it challenging to get the perfect shot. 

The main goal of most stages is to eliminate all enemies, but occasionally you also need to accomplish things like close portals that continually create enemies. Because you have to drag an extremely slow ball to the portal, these stages aren't very good. The fact that you must always stay close makes things worse; if you stray too far, it will stop following.

Progress can’t be lost. Dying just requires you to restart the current level and keep trying until you succeed. The following stage may be made even more challenging, though. Health is carried over to the next stage along with everything else you've acquired, such as ammo and souls that act as currency. 

The problem happens if you finish the stage with only a few health bars. Because health drops are rare, this means you will be stuck with that health the entire stage. It’s possible to turn a difficult stage into an chore that never becomes fun again.

As a game? The story was engaging, I could suspend my disbelief enough to feel like I was the one making decisions, and the decisions feel meaningful. The puzzle mechanic wasn't stellar and felt like an  obstacle rather than a challenge, but it was fun nonetheless. 

As a Tron Game? I found it super interesting how they decided to expand the world of Tron and it makes me excited they're trying to reach out past the light cycles and disc games. IMO I don't really like some of the expansions to the world and the major secret trouble (no spoiler pog) feels a little off. However, I'm glad someone has a new take of what Tron can be.

If you're going to disregard that the majority of your fan base came from your AVN college kings, then fine. But you'll have to come with your A game if you're going to leave out explicit content, and strictly rely on your writing merit. And FYI CK DIDN'T HAVE GOOD WRITING!

There's nothing interesting about the plot in this game. The main character is childlike and whiny, and his friends are unbearable. The only 2 characters that are solid is River and the brother Lance. Who the game is trying its best to paint as a bad dude, but instead paints the MC as a whiny brat who doesn't care about his family. 

All choices you pick are in a range of being either neutral or whiny. And a lot of the time, are confusing to understand in the context of the conversation being had.

The mechanics themselves; the cards, abilities, effects, and companions, all have something really neat, but it's buried under a horribly unbalanced experience.

The hero: Having a choice between three different heroes with random stats and abilities is fine on paper, but Wildfrost's execution of this leaves a lot to be desired. Your hero is frustratingly weak, has long attack cooldowns, and usually an attack stat of MAYBE 3-4. If your hero's death is your losing condition, they should feel more impactful. I know devs might not be the same, but this is the same glaring issue in another game chucklefish published; Wargroove. Another attempt to capture a niche but passionate audience but make lose conditions around losing your commander who has cool abilities and stats, so you are actually given incentive into NOT using them and mainly just keeping them safe. My hero feels weaker than first encounter mobs and can die in two good hits. One of the points of the genre is to start out weak and work your way up, but there is such a thing as too weak to even make it to the first step on the ladder. 
Companions: Cute feature and an added layer of deckbuilding to help guide you to a strong composition. Companions not only taking a card slot but ALSO a turn to put them on the field, is an exercise is design masochism. The enemies will usually have a field of 2-3 enemies, and 3-4 in some later fights. Forcing the player to start out 1v4 is unreasonable given the current card pool and balance state. I think being able to put charms on companions is nice, but I think I would have preferred a level up system where they progress naturally, since I am 4/5 times focusing on putting charms on my much more efficient companions instead of my hero. 
Cards: A basic system that works almost as expected. Again, the turn rotation and action allotment really hurts the experience. I am basically forced to place companions on the board before playing any cards that actually effect my enemies, and even then 4/5 times I am playing cards to keep me from losing instead of bringing me closer to victory. The cards almost feel like an afterthought when you look at Wildfrost's combat through the scope of an autobattler. If heroes could play more than 1 attack card a turn, the deck would feel a lot better to play with. 

Let's talk about enemies and encounters now
Enemies: Battles are randomized in a sense where you will face certain preset compositions picked from a pool. While this can present a challenge in the form that you are facing against a group of enemies that synergize with one another, it is also ball busting at times since they are much more optimized than you, the player can hope to be. Compounded with the fact that their board fields with units without a need to use a turn of action, you are often felt like you are fighting uphill the entire encounter. It doesn't feel rewarding to beat some of these encounters since not only do you not get anything besides currency, they don't feel like true wins since likely had just scrounged up protection for your hero and had cool downs tick at the right times. Enemy cooldown times are also extremely in their favor. If their abilities and attack stats were not so strong, this wouldn't be as big an issue, but whenever even ONE enemy is ready to do their move next I feel like I am forced to either slow them down, kill them somehow, or just accept that I'm making something eat the attack. Enemy compositions will likely appear that are an exact counter to your current build. Again, it wouldn't be so bad if the balance was in a better place. 
Map encounters: Cute idea, but not enough steps and impact on the run. I feel like with how powerful the enemies are, I need at least another rest spot or two to appropriately gear me for the next one. 

Overall, while this game has some decent art and nice groundwork for its mechanics, I can't suggest anyone pay the 20 bucks it costs just to run into the balancing problems a lot of people are facing. If decks, heroes, and companions were more in our control, yeah the difficulty could be managed as you can find a consistent way to overcome the encounters, but when you're thrown a bunch of weak combos that will not get you further than 2-3 battles, it just feels bad. I sincerely hope the developers take some of the feedback to heart and try to tackle the game's balance a little. It would be a shame for a project like this to just fade into the basement tote of generic and unsatisfying deckbuilders.",0.0

This is the worst low-IQ dev mistake I have ever seen.

Nothing is colorful in this game. Everything is desaturated to the hilt. Everyone lives through misery. There's a stat called happiness. There's no happiness in this game. And there's certainly no emotions properly conveyed in it. I think it should be called a ""misery modifier"". And I'm not sure that the result of ""more happiness in a group"" should be ""increasing the MAXIMUM number of valor points in combat by ONE"". You start most battles with less than the maximum. Ridiculous.

The battle is boring. It's a snooze fest. I see the tactical potential, but it's just so bland and unimmersive, you don't feel like making any progress, it's just repeating a task (engaging, dealing damage) in which the ultimate reward seems to be something like +1 strength which lets you deal......... +1 damage ?

When you get 15 willpower, YOUR CHARACTER RECOVERS FROM DEATH after being killed ---- ONCE PER ENCOUNTER CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT. At 14 willpower ? +1 to Critical Hit. At 16 Willpower ? +1 Critical Hit.

Also, just a side note... I go to a fisherman cabin. I need a fishhook to be able to fish... but there are no fishhook at the fisherman cabin -- which is FULL OF CRATES AND BARRELS UP TO THE VERY END OF THE DOCK.

Just to make it easy - great music, fun city builder, a great voice actor/narrator, and a wonderful combination of silly/cartoony and realistic as an art style. And at $15 or $20? Nah, go for it! Give it a try. 

A bit more in-depth - this game is made by a two-man dev team. Which is as mind-blowing as learning Manor Lords is a one-man dev team. With Fabledom, you feel the love they put into their project. There's a story here that will be fleshed out along with the game's development - delivered by game mechanics and a fantastic, sort of nostalgic narrator. The art style is very well crafted, allowing an indie team to seem like they're competing with PIXAR. The game has hints of Banished, Manor Lords, and in some sense, ANNO 1800. The game is calm and easy-going. I saw one comment that was pretty on point - Fabledom feels like how the new Settlers game should have felt.

And my top compliment - this game allows for travelling the map, and does a great mix of cute, cartoony city-building, with later-on added elements of combat. You can eventually build a castle and the surrounding walls, with both footmen and archers. 

Overall, support the game, support their art. Give it a try!

To note though - two negatives. One, as with most city-builders, the game is too easy. Again with other city builders, I doubt there's an End screen. The focus is of course actually building, designing, and decorating a city. But it needs far greater challenges and true game-ending events, if the player isn't focused or strategic. This might be mitigated slightly when combat is introduced soon.

Two - so far, nothing is really new here. You can tell there's love from the devs from this project. It feels like a game from the 90's or early 2000's when devs really, really were trying. I'm reminded of Halo...... But anyway, the game's great and it's fun to play. Buuut, aside from the story line, there's nothing really new here. Hoping to see what happens later on though!",1.0

If you're looking for something more tactical where you have to work with your team, use cover, and think a bit, then this is a great free option. Sure you can sprint towards the enemy in CoD fashion, but they're going to gun you down quick if your team isn't there.

I read a review that said in order to level-up your character, you had to use coins. I don't see that anywhere, you can use the in-game credits which you get just from playing the game & doing daily/weekly challenges. Just an FYI.
I've also seen mention of a Battle Pass, but there doesn't appear to be one active now, so I can't comment on that. All you need to know is that ALL Battle Passes are trash and basically force you to pay to get anything decent from them. So I expect that from this game too.

Is it Pay to Win? I don't play the PvP modes, so I don't now, lol. Is it fun to play without paying anything? Yes.
Here is some quick info:
[list]
[*] Bots can kill you quite easily if you're not careful.
[*] Abilities run on Stamina, so if you run out you can't use them or sprint. - I love this feature.
[*] You have limited revives per person, with Medic having a few more than the others. Keep your Medic alive so they can heal/rez if need be.
[*] Special enemies can be deadly. RPGs, Snipers, Heavies, & Chemists. Chemists are the worst, they throw poison gas that AoEs the area.
[*] I've had the game lock up if you try to interact with too many things too quickly in the menus.
[*] Classes feel fairly balanced, with Medic not doing a whole lot of damage, Sniper doing great with head shots, etc. So you really need the whole team for the most part.
[*] Some maps are pretty unfair. There is one where you infiltrate a lab and go through a decontamination chamber. It fills with poison gas that constantly damages you & has enemies. You need to reach a button to stop it. I have never been part of a team that has stopped it.
[*] On that note, most maps with objectives have two different paths that you randomly get, so it adds a nice bit of variety. For example, on the above map instead of the gas chamber you go through a simple room where you kill guys and activate a switch.

[i]Plantera 2: The Golden Acorn[/i] is a worthy sequel that adds new stuff, but still is as short and cute as its predecessor.  It's an idle game, but it moves [i][b]very[/b][/i] fast.

The basic premise of the game is that you are growing a garden and raising livestock.  Right away you notice a nice-sized oak tree smack in the middle.  This oak is the only thing that you will not be able to move or delete in your side-scrolling garden.

You are asked to click on some butterflies to catch them for coins with which you can buy your first crop, leeks.  Eventually, you will be able to buy berry bushes and other fruit shrubs, fruit trees, and animals, all with drops to collection.  You also can have two production buildings: jam-making machines and windmills.  The buildings don't seem to depend on production chains, though.

Once ripe, ground crops need to be clicked to pull them out of the ground and clicked again to sell.  Fruit on bushes and trees can be clicked when ripe to make them fall, and again to sell.

Fortunately, you are given at the start a Mellow, a cute blue round helper with a bland placid expression and a bag over its shoulder.  You can just let the little guy go pick up fruit, or you can click on stuff to help him.

Hang out with the game, and you will notice various mean critters that show up to mess with your garden.  Magpies steal crops.  Bunnies eat ground crops.  Boars and foxes harass certain animals and make them less productive.  You can click on them a few times to shoo them away.

One tab, the Special tab with the blue star, includes some things to help you with the critters.  Scarecrows and fences help keep the critter population down and help you with offline earnings.  Guard dogs scare off the critters.

The coins you earn double as XP to level up your garden.  New levels give you more helpers, garden expansions to purchase, and unlock new crops and items.

Those levels come FAST!  Spend time with game adding or swapping out crops and expanding the garden, and in just two hours, you'll get 15-20 levels.  A few more hours, and you've unlocked everything.

Another progress bar tracks the acorns you've earned.  These upgrade the oak tree and add things like birdhouses and beehives, and acorns.  Regular brown acorns can be sold for coin, while golden acorns give you the upgrade acorns when sold.

After you've unlocked everything and gotten all the achievements, there's still a couple things left to do.  You can try to see how far the garden can be expanded, for instance.

As you expand the garden further, you might also completely remodel it.

The game gets cluttered and busy pretty quickly.  This is due to the layers used.  Ground crops take one layer, bushes and shrubs another, and trees a third.  Another couple layers are for the special stuff, and yet another for the animals.  Each crop/building layer has limited slots.  The game does make it fairly easy to move or delete stuff.  A layer toggle helps to isolate items to delete or move.  Prices revert to how much you have currently installed, so demolishing everything reverts to starting prices.

With a few more expansions, there's plenty of room to have each crop in isolation if you wish.

You also still keep leveling up after you've unlocked everything.  Crops and animals eventually earn star upgrades with new levels.  It's unclear exactly what this upgrades, though.

You'll also earn more acorns to upgrade the oak.  Acorns can also activate some God Mode powers, mostly to increase Mellow helper speed and crop production speed.

There is, of course, a restart function to start a clean new game, so you can set some challenge for yourself or just revisit the game.

The dev is open to suggestions to what to add to the game, too, so the game might be worth hanging on to for a while.


Graphics are bright and colorful and cheery, with the animals done in a fat, squat, almost cute style.  Music has a relaxing, bouncy vibe.

If you liked the first game, you'll probably like this game, unless the speed at which you  unlock everything puts you off.

If you want an idle game you can actually ""finish,"" instead of numbers rising to infinity, you might like this game.

If you like gardening games, but don't like the hassle of tilling and watering and producing stuff yourself, you might like this game.

At any rate, it's very cheap in terms of time and money to try.",1.0

Some things to note:

The tutorial is serviceable, it teaches you the movement controls and combat controls well enough, but it’ll take you some time to get used to unless you’ve played other games with similar space mechanics like Space Engineers or Hardspace: Shipbreaker. Something I feel it lacks is letting you know about how interactive the maps are. Until I bumped into something with a button prompt, I had no idea I could open/close airlocks, pressurize sections, or ride cables. The tutorial should’ve at least had an example of this because it is really cool.

The class customization and the classes themselves lend to a lot of variety but there are some classes that tend to be more popular than others. Some special ordinances are clearly better than others and I can see some balancing rework being needed for some.

The actual combat is just downright awesome and it really is a tactical space shooter. 3D tactics feels both empowering and threatening as flanking maneuvers are so much more dynamic. Combat is intense and the map design blends close quarters combat with large open combat very well.

Speaking of map design. They’re some of the best I’ve seen. They are molded perfectly to their respective game modes. The only problem I could see is sometimes spawn locations can drop you in right on top of the enemy if they’re at your spawn. I didn’t suffer any spawn camping but I can definitely see it happening.

I saw other reviews talking about bugs or bad connection, and they very well may have experienced that, but I didn’t experience any kind of problems like that. My game kept up good connection, consistent frame rate, no graphical errors, or anything.

Overall I highly recommend it and look forward to seeing this game grow. I hope it gets the love and recognition it deserves. Hope to see you out there!",1.0

Another absolute masterpiece from D'Avekki Studios! Murderous Muses is a first-person supernatural murder mystery game where you must discover who killed Mordechai Grey by investigating portraits that you hang throughout the gallery. The portraits come to life and give snippets of information which you use to discover the actual killer among the 6 suspects. This isn't a premade story on rails like many FMV games. It's a first-person adventure where you have to figure out what goes where and how, or risk missing out on important information. And every playthrough is randomized with a random murderer, evidence and environments! No two playthroughs look or play the same, SO much changes between playthroughs. You can easily play it several times and get significantly different experiences. 

The game takes place over a couple days, each having a distinct day and night time. During the day, you receive new paintings and place them across the gallery, discovering the history of the area and important lore about locations.  At night, the gallery comes to life and you can investigate the paintings for information.   

I really like how it doesn't hold your hand. You get a little tutorial and then you're let loose in the gallery. You need to do a bit of sleuthing to figure out how the mechanics all work. And if you blow through the days you can easily miss major information. You might not win your playthrough if you mess up enough, which I love. FMV games are almost always too easy, but Murderous Muses actually asks you to use your brain and powers of deduction. And since each playthrough is unique, you take what you've learned about the game to make your next run better while experiencing a fresh killer and set of evidence. 

Lots of little easter eggs and secrets and the cool collectible room ensure I'll play this quite a few times through. There is a ton of lore to be found and many ways to approach the Muses. My first playthrough was about 4 hours, but I'm piecing through everything I can get my fingers on, YMMV. Even when you've discovered the killer, there's still plenty to uncover...there's a lot more going on than just the murder. It should take 4ish playthroughs to get all the achievements.

I find Murderous Muses an amazing title, through and through. The acting, writing and soundtrack are overall incredible, it's replayable and SO engaging. I can't get over how much changes between playthroughs, and I'm absolutely enthralled with Mirlhaven. I can't recommend this enough. And if you enjoy this and other FMV games, make sure to check out D'Avekki's other titles. Every game is a masterpiece, they all play differently and they're all in the same universe!

I LOVED the demo but what I think this game desperately need is a more divers path of enemies. For the most part you can make some pretty busted builds as usual for a rogue-like, but enemy encounters can just outright counter your deck strategy very usually since the game does not offer much diversity with deck creativity. If you could at least have two options in the path as to what enemy you are to face, I could enjoy myself without the frustration of praying as to WHO I will face. 
So prepare to be leaning HARD into the RNG luck of not ONLY what you get but what enemies you will face. You either synergize or die.",0.0

Wildfrost nails the art, mechanics, acension system, UX and  ease of understanding. Everything follows a consistent logic which although it can take many tries to learn the specifics it has never left me feeling like they made a mistake. 

I would say that the game falls flat when it comes to consistency between runs. RNG is expected for the roguelike genre but in this case it affects every aspect of the game including the most important of your 2 starting units, the leader, which has to remain on the board the entire fight and if it dies its game over. All fights come as one of 2 versions, with a different set of enemies for each. The issue with this is that they can be WILDLY different in how tough they are. The events between fights are also mostly random - this is alright as the events are balanced enough and the shop events even things out because it's never required to buy a card at a shop, and the coins can be saved up at bad shops until you find one with the items you want.

By far the most aggravating RNG comes at the very beginning of the run with the choice of 1 of 3 randomly generated heroes. Some of the heroes are leagues stronger than others. It makes a huge difference in getting a run off the ground. Unfortunately, resetting after having a bad hero selection counts as a loss so if you care about winstreaks or win rates this adds frustration. I prefer not to start scum but winning feels way more achievable when I start with a good hero. 
This actually gets WORSE with the ascension perks as you only have one hero available from each faction. The starting faction is the most powerful, the 2nd one is good, and the 3rd faction is the worst. So although I will prefer using one of the factions I do not have much of a choice when the one hero from it sucks. Factions determine your starting deck and a large amount of the available cards during the run, which makes this very important.

The biggest RNG in fights occurs at the first boss fight. It spawns with either the King Moko or the 2 tall Mecha boss. King moko is essentiatlly a 7-turn death timer, in which you have to kill the boss before he attacks or else he wipes out your entire board. On top of that he has 60 health which is very high at that point in the game, so the only way to beat him is through having units attack him enough times that the attack bonus he gives builds up and is enough to chew through his health. The mecha boss on the other hand only had 18 health in the first phase, and 15 health in the second phase, and does 2 damage. The attack is super easy to tank in the second phase and 18 health is only twice as much as the regular enemies. I don't mind the fight being difficult, but the variation in balancing is laughable.

Now for the reasons why I like the game. I'll start with listing specific mechanics outside of the basics you're taught in the tutorial and through text:

combat order goes top down, from the inside of the board outward starting on the enemies side and then letting the players side go through actions. All effects tick after attacks have happened.

Noomlings make cards completely free to play, as such if you have multiple cards with noomlings in your hand you can play all of them without using your turn

Companions can be put into reserve (you still have them but they're not in your deck for battle) at any time, with a limit of 3 companions going into battle

All effects are useful on every unit type, including bosses. This is handy because it means effect synergies can't get hard countered, and remain viable in each fight. The only exception is that some boss and non-boss units have snow resist, which means that they can only have 1 snow stacked at one time. Snow is an effect which delays that units attack timer by the amount of snow, this stops the player from being able to prevent a bosses attack entirely. This is different to slay the spire, which has units which are immune to different types of effects. 

Mechanics like 'sacrificing' where friendly cards have to be killed to gain a bonus are not treated any differently from any other way of a card dying - in one instance I had a card which applies 4 overburn get sacrificed by another unit, and it ended up applying the overburn to my own unit, killing it. Heroes are also treated like any companions by other cards because my own hero got killed when another card triggered its sacrifice on the row it was in.

Why do I like the game, even with those issues I've described? I still find a lot of fun in the strategy that comes with every decision made - whether to go with what's best in the next fight, or try to find a broken synergy 2 fights from now. To build a good deck it's always a good idea to have more than one strong unit and synergy because many of the fights test decks in specific areas. There is one fight where the enemies all have a lot of block shielding which blocks individual instances of damage. If you used a strong single damage dealer to get through previous fights it adds a lot of challenge because the attacks of that damage dealer will only remove one block, the same as if it did 1. To defeat the enemies you need either a strong defensive setup which lets you chip away at the opponent's blocks or many fast attacking units to destroy their threatening units quickly.

The most fun I've had with this game was naming my cards and messing around with OP charm combos, when I beat the game with my leader called 'YOUR MOTHER'. Now she resides at the final boss fight every time, with all of the broken combos which I created with those units alongside her. Every time I've gotten back to that point since I have lost to YOUR MOTHER I'm determined to build a more OP deck so I can see what happens when I beat the fight for a second time.",1.0

I kinda forced my way through the game Slay The Spire, but I got all the achievements so I like to think I'm good at these kind of games.

People say this game is badly balanced but I don't agree with that.  The runs are just short so every fight needs to feel lethal.  That being said I do think this game FEELS random.  There is just so much going on in the game that it's super difficult to keep up with and I found myself not understanding how I lost.  Feels like sometimes the stars will align and either you'll just randomly kill the boss or the enemies will just randomly kill you.

I don't even have 6 hours and I already stumbled my way into my first victory.  After that the character you won with becomes the new boss, the game lets you activate special modifiers for a run, and I still have a lot of cards to unlock.

IDK I don't review a lot of games I just don't agree with this being a hard game, just more of a noisy game where there's so much going on.",1.0

Notable innovations to the card-battler genre from an artistic and mechanical standpoint. Board positioning is essential, as is paying attention to the minute details of enemy effects and attack patterns.

This game is extremely punishing, and for me that is very motivating to keep playing. This is not a game where you can afford to zone out, and it holds tension even in the early battles of each run.

However, there are some changes that would probably make the game more fun. I think a system of re-rolling hero selections would be nice, because it's not fun to feel the need to play a hero that is almost identical to one you played in your previous run. There's some needlessly difficult interactions such as Monch insta-killing your avatar. It made me laugh, but it's really not necessary to have as many small ""gotchas"" like this to keep the game challenging.

I'm also not sure that forcing card selection from chests is necessary. Similar games such as Slay the Spire let the player opt to take nothing at all, which is often preferable than making an off-synergy pick. The large hand-size and bell re-draw system does already mitigate the drawbacks of having a dud in your deck, but I think the game is challenging enough that it could support players running leaner, meaner strategies earlier.

Or, as much as I like the injury mechanic, maybe just remove it or make it reduce the creature's stats incrementally rather than by half? 

Who knows without play-testing, but I'd consider some graceful ways to slightly re-balance.",1.0

+ When you grapple somebody, your dude has a chance of yelling 'GET OVER HERE!' 
+ Gets to the action fast and only lets up when you die. 
+ Only a couple loading screens. Some levels fade into one another. 
+ Talking about levels, it deviates from the regular 'convoy' theme at times and gives you trains, planes, exploding barrel trucks and even the sandworm from Dune. No, I'm not kidding. There is a giant sand worm. 
+ The grapple hook is free to use with any weapon. Nothing beats grappling to a group of enemies, letting the minigun rip and tear them apart! 
+ The fast paced, metal soundtrack. 
+ The enemies are styled like punk / post apocalyptic goons. 
+ The easily affordable price. 
+ One of the achievements for falling off the train is called 'Follow The Damn Train, CJ!'
+ Sometimes the enemies kill themselves by jumping and missing a moving truck, which is very kind of them. And funny. 

Things I Don't Like: 
- The pixel style of graphics: The indie shooter's unimpressive go-to for art style. Dusk. Nightmare Reaper. Cultic. Ultrakill. Gloomwood. And now MeatGrinder. It's just my preference. I don't like it and I grew up playing Star Wars Dark Forces 1+2! Although, this one is actual 3D all the way through. 
- Within 28 minutes I had a lot of repeated voice lines from the protagonist. I even turned down the frequency in which he speaks, but it didn't stop him from saying 'I LOVE THIS SONG' every time the music changes. 

Overall, an absolutely killer title for the price. 
And I totally recommend listening to the Mad Max Fury Road chase music if you get bored of the metal.

The meta-progression is very well implemented and allows you to push further and further every single run, You will get crushed by new foes over and over again until you adapt. But not at any point frustration will kick in. Every run allows you to play a completely different style and with the different tribes you'll have even more variety.

Every single encounter could end your run, leaving you on the edge, while your cute creatures fight other more angry cute creatures.

Now I will say the game isn't ridiculously hard as it sounded like it would be, but there is a lot going on and if you miss an effect that an enemy has or misalign your characters, it could result in a bit of a mess or injuries to a character or two!

But the fact that one of the more popular reviews states that they had 20 runs in 3 hours, and had somehow managed to die in the first battle is shocking! In my 3 hours I had 4 solid runs and made it to the third zone, with each run being a different unique setup than the last. I made a mistake or two in a couple runs which didn't ultimately end them and still did alright.

King Moko specifically was rather daunting, but I made it through the fight by quickly bursting him down with debuffs and sun rods. However the third zone though with wild boars I fucked up real fast and attacked one with my leader and died instantly. That, while frustratingly silly, was totally on me and forgot he'd just counter attack twice. 

Otherwise I played at a bit of a slower more meticulous pace, paying attention to enemies that had effects like giving armor to other enemies, or the enemy that causes aimless on your party and targeted them with cards rather than depending solely on my party. Switching people around to avoid big hits and using weak dummy deployables to tank big hits was very important for fights.

I'm not a fan of card games at all (Slay the Spire being the ONLY other one I play), but it isn't impossible to get into. There are a lot of ways to approach fights with cards, and if you don't figure them out you may struggle a bit with the game since it's less straight forward than Slay the Spire since you have a field of characters to manage that attack independently of played cards like the freeze attacks and such.

TLDR: The game has a lot of charm, the artstyle is lovely, and the music is great. There's a decent variety of build potential with cards, and it is super satisfying to figure out what works with what. It rewards patient play and a bit of experimenting. However, some enemy effects (eg. causing aimless to your party) can be frustrating since the fight partially is out of your control and you have to rely on in hand cards and a bit of luck on top of that.

Overall I'd rate it positively, but a couple battles can prove to be frustrating but it isn't anywhere what I expected from some of the reviews and the 60% rating. Of course it's still an early review so it should be taken with a grain of salt and ideally it could use some adjustments too.",1.0

There's a wide range of different species that can be grown, from fruit trees to flowers and vegetables. There's also a great variety of animals that can be raised, such as chickens, cows, and sheep. Additionally, there's a large number of items to unlock, such as gardening equipment and farm decorations.

The gameplay in Plantera 2 is very fun and addictive. The game starts with a small and simple farm, but as the player earns more money, they can expand the farm and purchase new plants and animals. There's also the possibility of hiring workers to help care for the animals and plants. However, as the farm grows, it also becomes more difficult to manage, making the game challenging.

The graphics in Plantera 2 are excellent, with a lot of attention to detail. The characters and animals are well-designed and the colors are bright and cheerful. The soundtrack is relaxing and helps create a peaceful and pleasant atmosphere.

Although I enjoyed Plantera 2 very much, there are some weaknesses in the game. The lack of a plot or story can make the game a bit monotonous and without a clear goal. Additionally, the gameplay can become repetitive after a while, especially if the player has already unlocked most of the plants and animals.

Overall, Plantera 2 is a fun and engaging game with many plants, animals, and items to unlock. While the lack of a plot may be somewhat disappointing for some players, the gameplay itself is very satisfying and addictive. If you enjoy simulation and farm management games, I recommend giving Plantera 2 a try.",1.0

1032,1032.0,1032.0,1032.0,1032.0,136668311.0,1364020,"I was really enthusiastic to see the gameplay previews of Boundary, and now that it's here, I am hoping this game succeeds. Where a lot of other FPS titles on Steam have brought unique concepts to the table and stumbled in a few key areas (content delivery being a huge issue), I hope Boundary's dev team learns and is able to create a living game that improves over time. So far, I am pleased to see the developers responding to English-language feedback and I hope that continues further into the game's development cycle. 

Since Boundary is releasing in Early Access and I'm writing this review on Day 1, I am hoping to write down a few thoughts to inform prospective players. Following are some plusses and minuses that I've experienced in the game as-is:

PROS:
-Delivers fantastically well on the premise. The sound quality is impeccable as well as the visual fidelity, and Boundary is very immersive as a result. You can see tracers and the Sun reflected off your helmet. Your character breathes heavily and you can hear the oxygen rushing out of your suit. Sound doesn't travel in space, and the game is starkly quiet as a result (but still full of rich sound design) I have spent the last hour in game goggling at my surroundings with my headphones at full volume to appreciate what this game has going on. It's really well done in all aspects, including in the menus.
-The game's visual design is great- the UI/HUD elements and ingame assets fit really well with the theme and everything goes together nicely. It remains to be seen where cosmetics will be taken (and I really hope against all odds they stick to the theme of high-tech space). 
-The gunplay is extremely satisfying when it's flowing well- when everything clicks it feels really well done. AAA quality for sure.
-The movement is mostly well considered and feels very fluid despite your character being in a clunky spacesuit. The grapple and boost mechanic are great for getting around.
-I appreciate the small aesthetic flairs- the weapon animations are nearly fantastic throughout (with a few small janks here and there), and I am a big fan of the character flairs given to each class. 
-Stability is great so far. Have not experienced any frame drops, lags, stutters, or crashes (thank UE4)

CONS:
-The translation quality to English is very poor at this time. A few things remain in Chinese, and the menu elements are pretty poorly translated throughout. The entire game needs a thorough pass by a trained localization team. 
-The HUD (ESPECIALLY the customization menu) has some information but is lacking many critical details. I saw a community guide up earlier that EXPLAINED each side pod's function, which is notably lacking from the game itself. Good luck trying to figure out what anything does at this point.
-A lot of gameplay elements are questionably balanced and don't seem to serve a function at this time. For example, there is a medic class but there isn't really a tangible purpose to healing your teammates as everyone is very dispersed around the map- and it's really difficult to land the healing device (?) anyways. 
-Some QoL stuff is missing, including what is mentioned above. You can't exit out of a match in the pre-game lobby, and the pre-round timer is too long.
-Some of the maps are not very good. The crash site one invites a lot of pot shots from across the map and a single choke point (a choke point in space! can you believe that?) contains a lot of the fighting.
-Engagement distances are kinda funky as CQC is rare- it's weird to figure out where the shotguns and SMGs will be effective compared to longer-distance weapons.
-For some people, the unlocked axes of movement could probably cause motion sickness.
-Some aspects of the movement are questionable- the landed state is clunky to move to and from, and the momentum brake isn't so useful when you can stop as is. Stick to the grapple for now.
-The tutorials are adequate but leave out lots of helpful info. See above regarding the lack of info in menus.
-The game desperately needs a region lock, and maybe more servers. I am playing against China/SEA players with 300+ ping on a regular basis.


NEUTRAL:
-A lot of the cosmetics in the game so far are directed towards a Chinese audience. Expect a lot of the items ingame right now to seem a bit strange out of context.
-I have heard some reservations from others about the Tencent anticheat but I would wager Tencent has as much data from me as Denuvo and EAC at this point. Download at your peril!!!

OVERALL:

The game is not anywhere near a finished state, which is to be expected in Early Access. I am still really excited to see Boundary improve over time, and I think it has the bones of a very solid, high skill gap, beloved competitive/casual FPS. The developers will undoubtedly encounter rampant sinophobia in a western audience and the challenge will be to warm people up to the unusual concept of space combat, but even in an early state, I can see a lot of love and polish in Boundary. 


Verdict: Maybe wait awhile to purchase as the game is pretty unpolished on Day 1. The price is more than reasonable for what's on offer at $25. I will come back to update this review as the game changes.",1.0

I had already put a couple of hours into the demo so I was very excited and waiting for this game to come out on early access and it is great. I love the narrator and the art style is so cute. I like that it has all of the foundation and mechanics from most city builder games, but has more of a cozy gaming feel where you can just sit back and relax while designing your fairytale kingdom. 

Scrolling through the kingdom can get very slow and laggy if you unlock a lot of the map, but that may be my computer not being very good. I’m really excited to see more of the world map interactions with other kingdoms. Disappointed to find out that castles and a other food source buildings won’t be available for a while, but I rather have early access and be here through the process than wait for the game to be fully done. 

Overall this game is so much fun. I was able to put in a lot of hours first day until I finished all early access content…. And then an hour or two more after that. And in excited to check out the creative mode and build some monstrous cities. Devs should be proud.

1039,1039.0,1039.0,1039.0,1039.0,136669888.0,1968710,"My immediate response to the ending was ""NO! [i]NO![/i] THAT CAN'T BE IT! [i][b]THERE MUST BE MORE![/b][/i]""

So yes, I liked the game so much that my biggest issue is how short it is. Unlike [u]Portal[/u], [u]MEATGRINDER[/u] doesn't really have the writing or story—nay, not even the pretence for a thrilling climax. Thrilling set pieces, most certainly, each one better than the last, but the game doesn't so much reach a satisfying finish as it does just end. There are a couple of cool bosses in the game but we don't get one very last boss to wrap things up, like a giant robot spider using tanks as skates.

But those set pieces really are good, I must say. From the very second level, jumping between trucks and flinging away bandits running and jumping at you never stops being fun, and then they just keep introducing new elements in each level to make it so much more fun and exciting! Having said that, while the final two levels are visually striking and dynamic, enemy placement is repeated and the gameplay loop doesn't flow as well so shooting enemies isn't particularly fun in them. However, as the levels are pretty damn short and it IS an amazing visual spectacle, it's not a problem at all as you'll only go through them once anyway.

I have a few more issues:
[list]
    [*]Not all weapons are created equally. The minigun feels and sounds rather underpowered compared to everything else and it heats up way too quickly. Also, there's really no reason to use the pistols once you've gotten the second weapon.
    [*]Hard Mode is, ironically, too hard. I think it's fine to punish the player more for falling on the road but a one-hit kill is far too unforgiving when the game is so chaotic that what you're standing on can just leave you far too suddenly and get you killed, or car placements are too far spread out that it's impossible to advance. 
    [*]The game is... visually weird? When enemies are close to me, it's hard to register a lot. I kick at them but there's little in the way of visceral feedback that tells me I've actually done it apart from the enemy suddenly not being in front of me anymore. Same goes for when I'm shooting them with the pistols. I guess this combines with the minigun issue of weapons lacking solid feedback, which could be remedied by sound effects.
    [*]I get you're inspired by [u]ULTRAKILL[/u], what with the graphics and that whole three-line intro bit at the start, but those things are just cheesy. Those things aren't what make [u]ULTRAKILL[/u] great and having those elements don't make you [u]ULTRAKILL[/u]. This game sets itself apart in so many wonderful ways while being alike in so many wonderful ways so those things just baffle me, really.
[/list]
Overall, though, I loved [u]MEATGRINDER[/u]. The sheer creativity and thrill behind every moment of the game makes me very excited for what Vampire Squid do next. I WILL say that, while I can appreciate a game focusing on gameplay over story, there's no reason why they can't intersect and work off each other. All games are enriched with context and boomer shooters are no different; [u]Metal: Hellsinger[/u]'s one example of this and even [u]DOOM[/u] 2016 uses the themes of the original [u]Doom[/u]'s tropes as good storytelling devices, from the Doom Slayer's violent reactions to everything and his lack of speaking. 

I'm not going to ask for long cutscenes and exposition. This game is, after all, about flow, and cutscenes like that would be just as flowbreaking as Hard Mode with all the deaths on the road. But surely the gameplay itself could tell the story; voice lines from your avatar that aren't pop culture references, enemy designs and voice lines, and even the set pieces themselves could result from decisions made by everyone involved in this crazy imminent pile-up. All the same, this was really cool.",1.0

""Crazy"" atmospehere of the game and all that inspiration from classic artists and sculpturs supported by music which let you escape from reality and forget about all others needs.
I think a good advice on clearing levels is to follow the pace of the evironment - do not hurry and look around you. There's no need to run it as much fast as possible rather get that ""tone"" of the game and just enjoy!

They could've done a little more like fixing the various spelling errors and grammar mistakes, but instead the scripts are ported over mistakes and all for all the games.

I think that there are legitimate criticisms to be made with the game, but my god. As of writing this review the game is sitting at a 60% review score and that is just simply unfair. One of the top reviews as my writing this complains that they died multiple times in the first fight in the run and that they had 20 runs in 3 hours. Having played around 5 hours myself, and having no prior experience with deckbuilders in the past, I can honestly say I have no fucking clue how that dude managed to lose the first fight enough times that they felt it necessary to note it in their review. 

The game is challenging. It is, sometimes frustrating, but I can honestly say that most of my deaths have been because I made a mistake, and I was playing too fast. Some reviews are complaining about needing some crazy luck or needing a perfect build, and that is just not at all true. I think maybe one of my runs was extremely lucky, and it wasn't the run that made it to the end. With smart play, making the most of your resources, and attention, you can make the most out of the vast majority of your runs. I can not emphasize enough that the reviews blasting the game about horrific balance and extreme difficulty are likely playing too quickly, just generally, but certainly in battles (once again, as a complete newcomer to the genre, no clue how one would manage 20 runs in 3 hours). And to say that the different enemy types require an exact ""answer"" is just flat out wrong. A wide array of strategies are entirely viable, and I've had great success with several, frankly entirely unoptimized builds. The game requires careful thought and each decision. It isn't ""impossibly difficult,"" it just requires patience and for you to not rush through every turn. I don't mean to outright attack other reviewers, but I worry the review score will drive away prospective new players. Most of the negative reviews are severely misguided, and clearly aren't engaging in good faith with the mechanics the game provides.

I can't say it is perfect, but I can say I've had a great amount of fun with it, and the current review score is criminal. It could absolutely do with some tuning, I can't disagree there, there are certainly some cards that just feel worthless, but to say that the majority are unusable is laughable. There is a legitimate criticism to be made in the games draw system, as it at no point informs you that you will be able plan out your future hands by looking at your deck and your discard pile. This is an extremely important mechanic, as it eliminates a rather large random element, and I only discovered it on accident.

The design, both visual and sound, are delightful, and full of little touches that show that the devs clearly had a great deal of passion for this game, and a great deal of enjoyment for it. Please, please don't be swayed by some of the less charitable reviews. The game is more than worth your time, and I don't regret my purchase for a second. I rarely if ever write reviews, but I felt I had to for this game. If I had to give a rating, it would be sitting much close to 85%. There are legitimate criticisms to be made with this, in terms of some design aspects and balance, but it's hard to have that discussion when the majority of the negative reviews I've seen have been made seemingly in bad faith by people that grew frustrated with a game that demanded their attention.

This game is not ""impossibly hard."" This game is not ""all rng."" It requires time, attention, and a great deal of player input for every decision. Saying that there is very little the player can influence or do is a flat out lie. I have saved what seemed like unwinable positions and lost what seemed like a sure thing, entirely on my own competence.

The collection also includes some bonus features such as concept art, music player, and online netbattling and trading.

The games themselves are good as it is, but Capcom went the extra mile and gave us online functionality and even made sure things like event-only distributions are accounted for here. The packed gallery and BGM player along with a nice suite of options means that this is THE way to play Battle Network.

Unlike the X Collection or the Classic Legacy Collection, the general change in style between 1-3 and 4-6 mean splitting this up into 2 volumes is definitely a smart move. Even with how the game changes between the two halves, it never truly feels like 1 through 3 are obsolete games. They still have a lot of good to offer and are totally worth picking up, but I can see why some people would stick to either Volume 1 or Volume 2 on their own.

As for the games themselves, what's there to say that hasn't been said already? Battle Network 1 is rough around the edges in a lot of ways, but the core ideas are there for a very fun game. You might want to play it first if you feel like you're not going to appreciate how much changed over time, or you might want to come back to it when you've seen why people love this series so much. Just bring a map with you because getting lost can happen often.

2 improves on just about everything that people had issue with in 1. It's still got some issues, but it definitely feels like a much more cohesive product with a refined look and feel. I remember this also having way more bonkers online than any other game in the series, with so many cheese strats and lopsided balance that can be fun, but may not be for you.

3 is definitely the peak of the series. It's not downhill, but everything just seems to come together perfectly for 3. Further fine tuning to the gameplay, the addition of the Navi Customizer to let you enhance Mega Man in all manner of ways, slightly better balance among the Style Change forms, and a meatier story that gives us a suitable finale for what can be considered the first ""arc"". The version split, while definitely a way to cash in on the Pokemon trend in some ways, does have some viability in Battle Network, with a unique boss in either version and some unique chips in each library. However, Punk is only actually in Blue, since Blue is actually just the enhanced version of Battle Network 3 made to look like a separate version. Tut tut, Capcom. At least later games actually are built with version differences in mind.

Battle Network is probably a cornerstone franchise for the GBA, and for many is going to be how they first found Mega Man. It's great to have them in this form, including online functionality, and even if you're not into Mega Man, you'd be getting into a rock solid action RPG with a unique setting and unique mechanics that has a ton of content worth sinking your teeth into.",1.0

The camp building is fun, the crafting is fun, I do like the profession minigames actually!

It is a lot like battle brothers and incredibly charming, I love a lot about this.
Why do I not recommend it? Because difficulty is done poorly in my opinion.
What do I mean? Well, let me explain.
Generally, challenge is a curve, while your strength goes steadily up, most games start out very hard, you become stronger and the curve swings down, you have reached a point where your new skills let you feel powerful. Then slowly the curve swings back up and new opponents and challenges approach, which allow you to truly be put to the test with the things you learned. Then you slowly gain new skills again and it becomes easier, so you feel rewarded about your progression.
This loop is how most games work.

Now, wartales instead is... two straight lines overlapping. You level up? All enemies instantly level up. You gain a new member? All enemy parties are suddenly bigger.
This is both immersion breaking and makes combat a bit of a slog. Battle brothers did this too, but to a far, far less noticable degree, where enemies felt like they slowly ramped up and when you got stronger there were still plenty of weak and fragile bandits.
Here suddenly even the refugees are 12 man parties swarming you like they think they're zerg, when they started out as 3 man. This means every combat is the same level of challenge, you never feel rewarded for getting stronger, because you know combat is just getting harder instead, so instead of saying ""yay I got a new great member!"" you think ""god damn it, now I'll have to fight 12 enemies every fight... I hope they don't all get the buff that makes them do 5% hp every attack"".

There is no reward for stronger, because enemies are always scaled up to your level, in fact it would almost seem that the more I advance, the weaker I get, as enemies scale even harder. It's... not very fun and it turns combat into a slog.
Battle brother does it very well, where enemies don't really get stronger, but gradually stronger parties with new enemies show up.
They don't do that here, it's just level 5 refugees with torches burning you down, and super elite bandits.
It's still the same bandits as in the early game, but now they're super boosted and there's 20 of them.

I want to recommend this game, but they just need to rework the way they do enemy scaling. Because like this? Well, the only result is always gonna be an immersion breaking slog of combat.
Improving your mercenary group should let you have some moments of victory.

Because when every battle is the same difficulty, and you never feel like you are growing stronger, and you're always fighting the same enemies scaled exactly to be as strong as you, every battle is completely forgetable and you stop caring about progressing.

You have some amazing systems, in my opinion the way battle actually plays out is very good, but the scaling is too much. When it comes to enemies and scaling, learning from battle brothers might be a godsent.
But I somewhat doubt they will.",0.0

- Lovable cast of characters, both friends and foes alike.
- Beautiful locations, both in Lan's world and in Mega Man's.
- Fun gimmicks per each entry, such as Cross Fusion, Double Soul, etc.
- Amazing pixel art.
- An overall very exciting and enjoyable adventure.

Cons:
- Random battle shenanigans being a wee bit too frequent for my taste. (At least for MMBN1. Been a long time since I've played these games, so I don't quite remember if the rest are as... Saturated with random battles as MMBN1 is.)

Will update review accordingly.",1.0
1133,1133.0,1133.0,1133.0,1133.0,136676453.0,1798010,"Battle Network 1: very much shows it was the first in the series. Random battles are frequent, and its the only one of the 6 that requires you to use escape chips to run, so you have to waste folder spots to have the chance to run from a battle. 
That gripe aside, its a fun game, and the sequels fix a lot of past issues.

Battle Network 2: adds so much more compared to BN1. More areas to explore Battle system tweaked for the better, and the story is pretty good.

Battle Network 3:
This is in my opinion the best BN game. Battle system has been expanded upon greatly, it introduces the customization system to make your play style your own. (a few complaints where you have to use certain upgrades for specific parts in the story) Speaking of, the story is my favorite of the 3. And the post game has so much do do. This was unfortunately the game they decided to split the game in 2 which makes you have to trade to get all of the chips. 

Overall I am happy this series finally has a modern way to play, and I hope we can see more MegaMan titles in the future.",1.0

To begin, I don't think the game is polished enough to justify a RM 50 cost. It still has some bugs. Omnem does fix them quickly though once reported, so it should fine given time. Single Player is fun for a bit, but it runs into some issues. Karmic Years do not decay and the amount you get from getting sieged is basically none(2 common years,really), making ai allies requires prefect ideological alignment(may get fixed when crises update comes out), and some stats like accident related deaths aren't really clear on what they do. Influence gain is way too slow for rapid expansion, even on the most forgiving settings, and it can be hard to find resources needed all the way to late game.
At least karmic years can be fully disabled in SP. That said, there are a few suggestions I would like to give.

A general resource mapmode filtered to a player specified resource as well as on nations for trade would reduce frustration on finding goods wanted by players.
Allow players to set up their own lobbies with custom settings, and add some additional settings, like guaranteed resources and karmic year decay over long periods of peace or after a set amount of time.
Clear up some stats on what they do exactly.
Add some way to increase influence gain, both in game and in pre game settings.
Make the ai easier to ally via multiple methods.

The game can be played with a fixed set and a randomized set. The former is good for understanding the views of the author and can be metagamed, but the sp victory requirements that scale with time suggests that the latter is the intended set. This is fine, a small adjustment for the fixed set or even sliders would be nice though.

The game does have a charm of sorts despite its flaws. I enjoyed reading all the flavor text as well as the events, and finding ways to break the game is enjoyable. Omnem does a pretty good job on expressing them self within the dialog and has heart put into it.

I would carefully recommend the game, but be might not be for you if reading isn't a thing you like to do. 

TLDR: Has heart, but still lacks polish. Good if you want to read and have time, otherwise buy something else instead.",1.0

Speedrunners are going to have a serious blast with this. Not just due to the movement techniques you can use to travel around as fast as possible, but also due to how many different options there are available at the player's disposal to progress through the game. The sequence-breaking capabilities are particularily fun to discover.

For instance, you might think that in order to open a door with 4 locks on it, you'd need to defeat 4 bosses so that you can get 4 keys.

I've been following this game since 2019 and have participated in several tests throughout the years.  The community, while small compared to AAA games, is extremely passionate about the game and want it to succeed.  While I hope it does too, there are some lingering issues I've been hearing since the initial playtests came out.  

I am more than content leveling up operators and weapons and ignoring most issues as the game's atmosphere, graphics, and music are all incredible and I'm generally easy to please when it comes to early access games.  There's truly no other game like this and the level of immersion had been a huge focus of the team.  What I'm hoping will become the focus are some of the lingering issues I mentioned - few modes, server issues + ping exploits, lack of explanation for most items, and a less than stellar UI.  Now that the game is out and the team is very aware of these, we'll just have to wait and see.  Many of the complaints I've seen in Discord and Discussions - LOTS of spawn camping, snipers being overpowered, bad hit reg, poor aiming - haven't really been my experience.  Every competitive FPS game has similar issues and not to sound like a jerk, but most of these can be combated by changing playstyles and/or getting better at the game.  You can only block so many times in Dark Souls before the need to roll is made clear, you know?

I've enjoyed many games that unfortunately never made it (Hawken, Dirty Bomb, Lawbreakers, Radical Heights, and Last Man Standing to name a few) and I truly hope Boundary doesn't make that list.

[b]+ Embark on a journey towards sainthood in the dark and eerie world of Stigmata of Sacrilege!ヽ(´• ω •`)、[/b]

[h1][b][1] Intro [/b][/h1]
Stigmata of Sacrilege is an action RPG game that follows the journey of Sophie, a beautiful orphan who is blessed with a sign from the Lord that she is fated to become the next saint. The game is filled with many enemies and bosses, all with unique attack patterns. In order to become a saint, Sophie must overcome her trials for sainthood and seek blessings from various holy sites that have become dungeons. 

[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]

What sets Stigmata of Sacrilege apart from other adventure games is the inclusion of adult content, which can be unlocked through a special H-patch provided by the publisher. This content enhances the value of the game, adding a sensuous and sensual element to the already engaging gameplay.

The gameplay in Stigmata of Sacrilege is fast-paced and challenging, with many enemies and bosses that require careful strategy to defeat. The combat system is well-designed, and the game offers a wide variety of weapons and abilities that players can use to take down their foes. The game also features a leveling system, which allows players to improve their character's stats and abilities as they progress through the game.

One of the highlights of Stigmata of Sacrilege is its visuals. The game's graphics are stunning, with detailed environments and beautifully rendered character models. The game's sound design is also excellent, with a haunting soundtrack that perfectly complements the game's dark and eerie atmosphere.

The story of Stigmata of Sacrilege is intriguing and engaging, and the game provides a rich and detailed backstory for its characters. The game is set in a dark and eerie world, where many devious and nefarious demons stand in Sophie's way. The main character, Sophie, is a sympathetic and likable protagonist, and her journey towards sainthood is both fascinating and inspiring. The game also features a cast of supporting characters, including Claire and Grace, who are both interesting and well-developed. 

Of course, as with any game, there are a few drawbacks to this game. The game's controls can be a bit finicky, which can lead to frustration during intense battles. Finally, the game's story can feel a bit predictable at times, with some plot twists feeling a bit forced.

[h1][b][3] Verdict [/b][/h1]
Overall, Stigmata of Sacrilege is an excellent action RPG that is sure to appeal to fans of the genre. Its engaging story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals make it a must-play for anyone who loves action-packed RPGs. The inclusion of adult content adds an extra layer of excitement and sensuality to the gameplay, making it a great choice for players looking for something a bit different. Highly recommended!

Have to say the only improvement is the graphics, all other changes are just fillers and unnecessary, if not to say, laughable horror scenes. The remake is much easier. I did not expect, that the same riddles would have been implimanted, but the whole ""New Orleans""-part, took me an hour at most. When I played the 2008 version I have spent at least an hour at the safe alone.

Now the thing that realy drives me mad about this game. When we arrive at the hospital, I was quite surprised to see Dr. Gygax had become a woman, I am sure there were a lot of female administration staff in hospitals back in the days. And that all the staff memebers had decided to wear very obvious red amlets.
May I remember that this part of the game takes place in Switzerland? And then,  there is not even a German synchro for this game.

And then there are these stupidly made emotion scenes.  The developers take your picture of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson and throw it straight into the rubbish bin.

Last Frogwares game I have bought, did not buy any of the new games already. But I did not expect them to fail the remake like this as well.

2/10 but only because the game looks nice

Let's get straight to the point; Zen Studios has delivered another solid Pinball offering with excellent licensed tables and in-house creations. They have built a better Pinball FX3, and technically the latest installment is superior to its predecessors in almost every way. Additionally, they now include instant access to Cabinet Mode, which works well for owners of Virtual Pinball Cabinets. There are also updated physics to mention, and the exclusive tables for the new game look gorgeous! 

The biggest problem that most Pinball FX enthusiasts will face is that they own up to 80% of the tables and have paid only a fraction for each through the various Pinball FX3 sales over the last five years. There is no way to move these tables to the latest platform, which is just another barrier to enjoying Virtual Pinball. Don't get me wrong; it's not like Zen will pull Pinball FX3 from Steam and somehow remove the owner's access to the tables they already own on the previous version. They are just creating a distaste for PFX3 owners and potentially confusing prospective consumers for the new version of Pinball FX. 

It's bittersweet that such a solid offering can drag itself down by not giving the most loyal fans a path to bring tables forward and take advantage of the apparent benefits without repurchasing every table. The alternative option is to spend endless money purchasing monthly or annual access to the tables, which is nothing I am interested in. These access passes may be a good option for others, and I will encourage everyone to play these tables as they see fit. 

In the end, I'm going to hold off for the tables to go on sale and pick the ones that I don't own first and slowly ( and cheaply) pick up the remaining tables that I deem worthy of a second purchase.

Enjoy!

And only for that change and some other minor visual improvement (that looks completely overdone and creates a lot of visual disturbance), they're charging people again if they want to play the tables they already bought in FX3 / FX2, using some ridiculous bundles to make it seems like ""it's a great deal"" for all those FX3 players.

Optimization is not good either, performance is all over the place, loading times are quite high for a simple pinball game (even worse than FX3). Tables (both old and new) are overpriced, at least in my region. Table achievements are missing.

1242,1242.0,1242.0,1242.0,1242.0,136662678.0,1949030,"[b]Normal Game Stuff[/b]

The environments are really nice, lighting and graphical fidelity overall is awesome with Unreal Engine 5 goodness, and the sounds are really good. You can feel the London gloom and the Louisiana heat. Stuff like footsteps on various types of terrain and the sounds of opening and closing doors are some little details that really increase the realism and immersiveness. High level of polish on everything.

Game wise, initially my main point of comparison was Call of Cthulhu - I now feel that’s a bit unfair at least from a gameplay perspective. CoC is an RPG. The Awakened isn’t. It’s a detective game, so pretty much all the gameplay is puzzle solving, mostly piecing together clues to figure out what happened at a scene. There’s never any time pressure apart from a few isolated events. 

The game is also completely linear. There are dialogue choices you can make, but they don’t affect anything in more than a cursory way. There’s only one ending.

[b]Horror[/b]

I consider myself a coward when it comes to horror, and this game is fine. There are a few semi-jumpscares (and they’re delightful), but not many, and most of the “horror” is the analytical discovery of what happened at a crime scene. I actually wish the game had more horror content to make the threat feel more palpable.

[b]Mythos Treatment[/b]

This is the stuff that really matters to me. CoC had jank, but I liked how it treated the Mythos, so that’s the bar to beat.

To me, there’s 2 crucial elements to this kind of Lovecraftian tale: the slow buildup of dread truth, and the protagonist’s inevitable descent into madness (i.e. their reactions to the truth being revealed).

The Awakened unfortunately falls over a bit here. Where CoC got freaky not too far in and then kept ramping up, the Awakened layers on the Mythos to hook you in at the start, pulls back through the middle, then ramps it up again for the end. I was particularly disappointed at the middle section, where human horror is the focus. I don’t want the Witcher - humans are not the real monsters. If you’re telling a Lovecraftian tale, sure, humans are monsters, but the real monsters are the [i]monsters[/i]. [spoiler]This is the Awakened’s biggest weakness - we never directly, incontrovertibly see a Mythos creature. We don’t see a Deep One, and certainly not Cthulhu. We never get confirmation that the Mythos is real. There’s definitely brain-bendy stuff going on that speaks to Sherlock’s mental deterioration (in particular there’s 2 actual scares in the first half that have stuck with me), but there’s always plausible deniability.[/spoiler]

Sherlock’s reactions to stuff are mostly good - like I said, the voice actor for Sherlock does a really good job of someone supremely confident in their mental faculties struggling when those faculties suggest things that don’t make any sense. This is particularly true in the final confrontation with the big bad. I love the climaxes when [spoiler]there’s the dialogue between the insane, zealous antagonist and the protagonist who desperately wants to deny the truth but can’t. The moment when it all becomes too much, and the protagonist’s hold on traditional reality breaks and they finally give in to the awful truth of the universe -[/spoiler] those are the moments that I love the most about these tales, and despite the lacklustre buildup, the Awakened sticks the landing really well.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

I would wait until this game is on sale to play it. It’s too expensive unless you’re craving this specific thing. It’s consistently middling with a very good climax.

If you’re craving a Mythos hit, play Call of Cthulhu - it’ll be way cheaper for one thing. It has lower lows (older game jank, and prolonged tedious stealth sequences) but also higher highs ([spoiler]getting violently dismembered by a Dimensional Shambler, actually summoning Cthulhu[/spoiler]), and you’ll get to see way more actual Mythos stuff and feel more scared of it. It has skill points and skill checks. It has multiple endings. It has a R’lyehian language. It has a sanity meter. God I love the sanity meter in that game. I know it’s a reductive and inaccurate depiction of mental health but I don’t care, it’s amazing. It starts full and never ever increases, it only ever goes down. Some dialogue options are locked if your sanity is too high. The descriptions of your character’s slowly deteriorating mental state are freaking great. If you want this, play CoC.

Anyway, that’s the end of my review. Hope that was helpful.

For starters, IMO the best two games in this series are Crimes and Punishments and The Testament. Both get at the heart of Sherlock Holmes mysteries and really demonstrate the game play one would expect. The Devils Daughter was so bad I almost didn’t play Chapter One. And while I thought Chapter One was a little sad, I enjoyed it so I was excited to see what they would do with The Awakened remaster. 

Now this remaster looks great and I like that it references Chapter One but that’s about it. It’s too short (which I get because of the devs having to deal with real life issues) and linear which can make the side cases added to the main story difficult to complete because you can’t go backward. The mini map is difficult to use because there’s no pointer to show where you are on the map. And I know the devs like horror games, but I think this leaned to heavy into that direction while forgetting how to tell a true Sherlock Holmes story.

And the thing I really didn’t appreciate the most was the ending. Sherlock is quirky but he’s not insane. I think the devs are leaning too hard into exploring what makes Sherlock tick but have gone off the deep end. I really hope that if they continue this incarnation of Sherlock, they pull back a bit on that. Or I’m really hoping they go back to what they did for C&P and the Testament.

I think next time I’ll wait to preorder the game.",0.0

The main draw to the game is that there is no double jump, only a grappling hook. This means that rather than trying to time a midair jump you have to carefully plan a big swing or drop in order to try to make it to your destination. This control scheme allows for extremely fun and addicting game play while also having an extremely high skill cap. 

Oh and did I mention there are ROCKET JUMPS!!!! Yes that's right just when you thought your bungee grapple hook experience couldn't get any better the devs added a ROCKET JUMP! so now you can blow your enemies sky high and fling yourself through rocket propelled means!

I personally put over 30 hours into just the demo of this amazing game and for around a 10-11 hour experience this game ticks all possible boxes for me! Overall this game is very rewarding if you take the time to learn the mechanics as even after 30 hours im still constantly learning more about the physics of the game and the more I learn the more fun the game becomes.


Happy swinging!

The general aesthetics were extremely pleasant, and reminded me a bit of Momodora; what story and lore there was looked very compelling; and oh - most importantly, the gameplay was fantastic. Platforming felt great, the grappling hook had a slight learning curve but quickly felt like second nature and opened up so many options and so much depth. Now that the game is out and while I'm not nearly finished with the game yet but I am pleased to report that the game is everything I had hoped it would be - maybe more. 

Everything I said about the demo holds true for the full game so far, and in terms of new observations: The game does an excellent job of providing a well structured critical path, while rewarding expert play with an incredible amount of free-form exploration which often feels sequence breaking (in a good way,). Exploration is extremely rewarding, offering skill-testing platforming challenges, exciting new guns and items, interesting lore, and brutal optional bosses.

It's a shame they are no longer on Steam, granted I think the genre has been going downhill after UT2004, they tried but it could capture the magic -  that awesome music, simple gameplay, and just satisfying carnage. This game attempts to capture the spirit and the soul of those games, but it also adds a twist to it which I did not enjoy. 

Everything outside of the core gameplay is a bit lacking, the only thing this game does really well is just the feel for the weapons and the character movement (except the bots, they are kinda junky). The current story mode only has about 70 minutes of content, so you really not getting a lot for the price. Now, you can play against bots in the custom games, but the AI pathing is very bad, pretty much making it pointless, especially in the domination and the ""capture the flag"" mode. Also, I feel like the maps need to be bigger, the bots respawn almost right on top of me, and there is never a window where I can actually benefit from killing them, it's easier to just ignore them, maybe there needs to be a respawn delay.

Interestingly, this game is not what you might think, I don't want to say much more than that to avoid spoilers, but it's not in a classic format where you progress in the arena, although I kinda wish it was, something like UT2004 would be more appropriate here, I would prefer a team management game. There are some gimmicks in the narrative that don't work, every time I am trying to enjoy the gameplay it has to interrupt me in order to do some narrative gimmicks. If I compare it directly to Unreal Gold, there is only 1 big stage in this game, and even that is only 10-15 minutes,  the tension that I felt running away from Unreal predators is just not there. 

I am seeing a lot of praise for the narrative here, but outside of some funny cheese from 90s there is really not a lot to say, it's very cliche at this point to have any kind of mind games. If anything, I think the Unreal story part was told through a good level design and navigation, and I find that many stages in this game didn't get the same treatment. 

[h1]Pros: [/h1]

(+) With the exception of the AI, I think the character movement and the weapons feel good. I find the game plays a bit too fast compared to  UT so tracking with guns can be a bit unpredictable if you play on high difficulty, but if we can just make the hardest AI less teleporty, I think it would be fine.

(+) The game seems to use the same or at least similar sound effects, for the most part, the actual atmosphere is very nostalgic. I mean the music is not as good, but I mean, how many games have better music than UT, not many. I appreciate a little bit of 90s action voice lines.

(+) I do like the visuals, but I think the dev is missing the point with some of the levels, it depends on the location, I think there is a lot of room for improvement, you could even rely more on platforming to create challenges since you can move so much in this game, don't be afraid to create more verticality for the player to jump around.

[h1] Feedback: [/h1]

[u] Enemies & Level Design [/u] - one very big problem with this game is that many enemies are not actually fun to kill. Like, you have these guns that have nice impact feel to them, but some of the story parts have these stupid projectiles that you can't see or some random birds. I have not seen any decent enemies that are not bots until one of the last stages. Honestly, you should completely remove all of that poorly color-coded junk, all enemies should be chunky and fun to kill, try to combine Unreal with Doom for the story parts.

The arena stages are too small specifically for the team modes. Also, you want to put the respawns a bit further back so the bots don't come back instantly when you kill them.

You need to make longer levels with more optional navigation, the only stage in this game that kinda matches what I expected from this game is the one with the robot boss. It often feels like you are running through an empty level with nothing to do. Also on a side note, try to avoid overusing any dark corners like the stage with the acid, even if the texture is not great it will always look better than just dark wall.

[u] AI [/u] - the pathing on the AI is very bad, and yet if you play on the hardest difficulty it's very hard to track them with a gun, the movement in this game feels maybe 30% faster than UT so it's almost like they are teleporting around (assuming they don't get stuck like they often do).

[u] Narrative [/u] - if that is what you want to do it's fine, my problem is that it feels like the game takes the control away from me all the time. Like, let me play for 30 minutes, then inject some narrative you know, if you play mind games every 5 minutes it's not going to feel like an Unreal game, you still need some immersion with the level exploration, and that means stop interrupting the gameplay.

[b] Overall Thoughts on EA 4/14/23: [/b]

I think the game gets the atmosphere and the gameplay right for the most part, but when you look into the details, like the magic of Unreal level design, it needs a lot of work. The story is a bit too much in your face, you want it to feel more natural, don't force mind games on player, more game, fewer interruptions. Probably not worth what the dev is asking for it, I expected more than 70 minutes, or at least an arena mode that is fun to play (the AI sucks). 

Unreal has some sentimental value for me so... I figure many people would find this a bit underwhelming, but it has a few nice things going for it.

RTX 3080 and an I9 9900k with 64 gb DDR4
Played at 1440p 120 fps.

Absolutely no lag.
Graphics look great with ray tracing.
Too early regarding the physics ( I shall update in time) it is different not sure for better or for worse yet.

I have read reviews on here from people having so many issues but I have not.
The difference between the graphical finesse of this version compared to Pinball FX 3 is blatantly apparent.
Some are saying they cannot see any difference but honestly they need to go to Spec savers.

Some are saying it is slugging even with the card I am using but this is not so.
There may be something wrong with their systems /drivers/ whatever.

I have bought three tables the Williams new ones.
I have played a few of the others but the polish shines through on the original tables far more than any others.

This version is not an essential purchase but more of an option to play the newer tables ( least for myself).

The pricing here in Australia seems reasonable and I suspect some of the bitterness in reviews is people using a potato and so they are stamping their feet ranting because they 'wish' they could play it.

Anyway like I said, politics aside this is worth it for the new tables of Williams etc.
I own all of the tables on the older version but doubt I shall be buying the Star Wars and other such Marvel etc.

I shall likely stick with buying only original 'new' tables.
Graphics all highest settings ray tracing on 9/10 on the Williams tables.
Sound: Seems crispier and more base better spacial reproduction.
Game play: Different from the last version the jury is still out but seems good.

Value for money for the tables: Well pinball is my thing and I shall eventually probably re-buy the original Williams because they look so damn good, yet not with immediacy.

All of the other tables I likely shall not buy at this point.

Verdict if you're on the fence.
It is NOT an essential purchase unless like me you're a pinball simulation addict and want all the bells and whistles.

There is NO fundamental reason to buy it if you're on the fence FOR EVERYONE ELSE.
Overall score and verdict:
9/10 A must buy for the new Williams tables.
The rest is optionally all your own.

You can view my initial impressions review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/BcbFdvH3lx8

If you enjoyed playing Kill It With Fire (Non-VR) then you're going to enjoy this VR port. It is a bit on the janky side though. However, it's just fun to be an agent of chaos in VR.

You get to kill Spiders in a plethora of manners. You have silencers, shotguns, revolvers, flamethrowers, molotovs, explosives, bazookas, a frying pan, etc. You can set the whole world on fire with your single-minded quest to kill any possible spider that may be out there.

If you enjoy explosives, this game is for you. If you're an aspiring arsonist, this game for you. If you just hate spiders, this game is for you. You can follow the objectives for each map or just do your own thing. The only thing that matters in the end is to kill all the spiders by any means necessary.

Game is running on the Unreal Engine. On my RTX 3080, on high graphical settings, I did experience some severe frame rate drops / stutters ... usually when lots of stuff exploded. I should have probably lowered the graphics to medium though. You have full locomotion or teleportation available, along with smooth or snap turning. You can play comfortable seated, as there is a button crouch, height adjustment, along with magnet hands. There is some jank though grabbing items or using your inventory, etc.

I think the game is fun, if you like retro shooters you probably will like this one too, I played almost 3 hours and not sure how much longer left in game but overall I think it's a good game. 

Visual are cool, specially the lighting of the game felt really nice. Game play is fun and can be challenging at some areas. There are variety of enemies to kill and as developer said it's basically killing horde of enemies. There is no story you just progress through different levels which each one has a very unique design too.

The only think that I didn't like was music and to me it felt out of place and disconnected from the game, had to reduce the music volume. But it might be just a personal preference.

Also I wish boss fights were more unique and challenging. They are basically bigger version of regular enemies with horde of enemies supporting them while you fight them.

BN3 Blue was the first game I owned on the GameBoy Advance and was blown away at the time playing this game and so much nostalgia overload has hit me. The show was also a hit back in the day (early 2000s) on Kids WB growing up. I’ve never played the first two but I’m going to play through all these games (1-3) then onto (4-6). I’m honestly content with how much Capcom put into this spin-off series.

Aside from my good thoughts on the BN series , the craziest thing I could say about these games especially the show (NT Warrior & Axess) pretty much predicted today’s current tech (PETs = smart phone devices, able to jack in to devices such as ovens, TVs, doghouse I know lol, etc. = Internet of Things). Of course fighting viruses in the Mega Man BN series equates to cyber crimes in real life. It’s insane how these games in the early 00s were far ahead of their time and pretty much predicted the 2010s and so forth. Thank you Masahiro Yasuma.",1.0

I am not sure about the difficulty criticisms but at the very least, it feels like win or loss, I had little choice in the matter during the actual fight. Four companions max (with some options to increase this) also felt like options were limited.

the game is Still super fun to play and a quick loop. you can slowly learn the set battles you come across and learn from your past encounters with em. It's a rouge like your supposed to loose a good couple times as you learn the game.

yes rng does suck a bit i have lost to the first fight more then once cus of poor rng car pull but hey not ever run can be a good one.

for a game i have not one once yet i am still having a lot of fun in it. learning some companion synergies and the best way to play as each tribe.

I was surprised to see mixed reviews for this game, so I went back and read through quite a few of them. It seems that the majority of the criticisms are related to the difficulty factor and unbalanced elements of the game.

I must admit that I have lost in this game... a lot! So, is it hard? It certainly can be. But unbalanced? Personally, I don't think so. The unique mechanics and strategies can be challenging at first, but I think it's a good kind of challenge. Every time I lose, I can see what I could have done differently to give myself a better chance, or decisions I could have made to be more survivable.

The game has a unique gameplay setup where you have two rows with three places on each row. You can ""crown"" units so that they are available to be played on the first turn. You can also reorder units and recall units to heal them, then replay them later. There are also a variety of cards that synergise with the units. There is so much depth to this game, and it gives you a lot of strategic options to explore.

All in all, the game is very creative and innovative in its mechanics, and I can't wait to play more.",1.0

It does seem like its a turned based game that just drops you in the middle of somewhere and it says ""Go forth, and find something to do"" , as if you were a child left alone in a playground. 
This is what this game does, it invokes adventure.   I really am liking the survival system, and managing your partys gold. food . The more you explore, the more the map uncovers for you. The game treats your characters like they do not know anything, and the more you check things out, the more they can learn and grow.

The only thing I am not liking is the camera !! You are only allowed to zoom in and out by a small increment and your characters always look like ants on the screen.

1. Bad net-code. 
A friend of mine had to restart his computer after 5 minutes from the start of the co-op session because wartales somehow completely froze the system. His computer specs higher than recomended system settings and he had never face with such problems before.
Second situation happened in the 10th minute of the game, we came into salty mine talked with npc but later understood that we can't leave this location. Any our actions had no response.

2. Lack of information at the start of the game
My friends and I bought this game just to play together. In a co-op session, you have a tutorial about the game mechanics, but there is no introduction to introduce the player to the world, and no explanation of the main objective.
Maybe this will be explained later, but it would be nice to get a brief overview of what the game wants from the player at the start of the game.

[b] Distilled gameplay elements with a survival and resource management synergy leads to a fun and replayable experience! [/b]
https://youtu.be/l-vbXDYvoh8

TLDR in case you don't want to watch the video:

1. Its less complicated and in-depth compared to bigger scale turn based tactics games (like X-Com), but the synergy and decision making during missions makes it equally intense 

2. Aside from the obvious turn based tactics comparisons, the resource management and survival elements like food, rest, stress levels, and shelters give the game another dimension that add onto its already tense combat. It's simple enough to understand, but tough enough to make it so much more than just a walk in the park

3. Its not award winning writing and dialogue, but the environments and side missions / events certainly add onto the world building and lore in Shardpunk's grimdark steampunk world.

4. Despite its rather short campaign (about 5 -6 hours on normal difficulty), the wide variety of characters, skills, tactics, quirks, campaign map, and overall types of playstyles, give it so much more replayability!

Its not the next groundbreaking title in the genre, but it certainly is a well executed amalgamation of some of the best turn based gameplay elements, and more!

I would recommend fans of turn based tactical games to give Shardpunk a try!

The game is very short though, I finished it in 25 minutes, but there is a bonus option to roam free through the map, which is a very nice addition.

Finger Soccer is a Unity Asset flip, what Valve calls a ""fake game"".  The ""developer"", 小小游戏, took the [url=https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/finger-soccer-game-kit-45611]Finger Soccer Game Kit[/url] Unity Store tutorial/demo/game asset pack from the real developers, Finalboss, changed the name, and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get $4 USD of your money for someone else's work.

The products that result from asset flips aren't ""real"" games.  They lack depth and content, because they're just simplistic copies of demos or tutorials.  In this case, ""Finger Soccer Game Kit"" is just a game pack/template to teach people how to make a soccer/physics game for mobile phones, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so a copy+paste of it can't be recommended.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  Sure, sometimes they may change a few cosmetic things, swap out different assets etc, but at heart it's functionally identical to the asset they're ripping off.  In this case it's a direct 1:1 copy of the asset with no noticable changes. 

Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

I won't hide it: I love this younger Sherlock. I loved him in Chapter One and having him going through this adventure. He is freshing up the series and it was very entertaining having a younger and less experienced sherlock solving the case. 
Connecting his emotional status with the events of Chapter One was so on point. I was a little skeptical at first 'cause this is basically the very first adventure with watson (where in the old games they know each other from a very long time) but their  reletionships was developed very well. 
Knowing the rpg of call of cthulhu it's like sherlock is failing all his sanity rolls while getting all the intelligents rolls. 
Althought I didn't quite like some of the changes from the old title, others where perfect and heartbreaking.
They used the same gameplay as chapter one, which I liked, but a couple of old style puzzles would have be a nice reminder of the old title. 
While the supernatural thing in devil's daugher was meh, Lovecraft horror works incredibly well with sherlock.

1350,1350.0,1350.0,1350.0,1350.0,136734973.0,1811990,"The game is quite hard but I feel like many reviews focus a bit too much on ""winning"" rather than just enjoying the game for runs. I feel like beating the game is only icing, the real fun is playing through the game and using what you're given and I want to say no, you're not always given the opportunity to win even with the best of skill sometimes but I do want to say most times, winning is definitely within arm's reach. That said, I still do have my gripes about the game:

1.) The starting leaders doesn't seem to make any rhyme or reason to how they are balanced. For example, I can be given a 12hp 5attack 4turn leader and while also simultaneously be given a choice of a 8hp 4nut(shield) 3attack 5turn leader. The second leader is very similar to the first except that it has 2 less attack and has one more turn of count down. Like why? The only explanation I see is that they're from different tribes but the tribal differences isn't THAT big to ever pick the latter leader in this scenario. I can never see a reason why any leader should be 3 attack and have a 5 turn count down - not even if they have frenzy, in fact, 5 count down leaders just shouldn't exist, period. There have been many multiple other instances of just crappy leaders and there's no way to ""reroll"" them without starting a run and quitting (which makes me feel dirty).

2.) There are some enemies that are incredibly hard to deal with and more notably, two types of enemies that consistently ends my runs. The enemies I'm talking about is the acorns that gives 3 thorns to all allies and the other acorn that makes all YOUR units aimless. These guys always spawn together and it is completely brutal to have to deal with because the aimless causes you to attack randomly within the row while the thorns is well, going to likely kill your units, especially given how the average hp of units is 5hp, getting just a couple unlucky hits in means everything of yours is dead. Now this wouldn't seem nearly impossible to deal with except that the health of the acorns are like 14hp so not only can you not control which enemies you're hitting in that row but even when you do get lucky, you have to get lucky multiple times. That is just in no way acceptable that these enemies exist with that much health.

All said though, the game is fun, I just don't think playing it with the mindset that you're going to win every run is realistic and quite honestly, that's the way rogue-like games should be. Sometimes you're just given crappy choices and you just have to make the most out of it.",1.0

The art is amazing. The music is exceptionally nice and reactive. The gameplay is highly innovative.

The game is roguelike first and everything second which means you will lose and lose a lot. This does not ponder or feed the questionable mind of ""modern"" gamers who cannot stand losing and just scream ""uwah ah oh no I'm 3 hours into the game and I still cannot win the first fight consistently. this is clearly a balance issue."" or ""uwah ah oh no I'm 10 hours win and cannot even get my first win, this is clearly a balance issue."".
Yes. The game is highly unbalanced, and it is one of the main issue right now but that doesn't justify the amount of negative review the game is getting. The first fight is definitely winnable by any means and there might be some case with cursed bells that will just make you lose but it's just roguelike in general - you are not meant to win every run.

The glaring issue; however, is the bs randomness the game can bring to your run which can be unbearable at times (yes I'm talking about you dangling cursed bells), but if you are playing casually the first few fights are definitely doable and can be won quite consistently (I'm looking at you shademancers).

Another problem is it's a card game that requires skill to play, so it might not pander certain group of people too.

So all in all it's just crying gamers wanting to win everything without caring if they're having fun or not spam their frustration on unjustified ""wah wah unbalanced make me lose 100% fight I cant even do first fight this is clearly balancing issue"" negative reviews.

If you don't care losing and just like roguelike in general, the game is for you, but if you are not just stay away. It's just that simple smh.

I see many ppl complaning about balance, some even claming you have to follow some kind of ""meta"" to get past the 2 first encounters but thats just not true, the game gives you a stupid amount of free controll during your turn(you can move around your units as mutch as you like, optimizing damage taken you can even for free recall units and they heal up). Like other games the endgame becomes ""scale up FAST"" usually but thats not a bad thing, the amount of ways to synergize your cards in this and the interaction between cards are staggering, for example did you know you could use flamewater on cards in your hands instead, for example on slapcrackers(4x random attacks that deal 1dmg) to doubble its damage output instead of putting it on an 6 counter unit. I hate to be this guy but if your complaning that the game is ""unbalanced"" or something simular then just git gud and start reading what the enemy cards do.

I dont know where many of these reviews are coming from maybe the beautiful artstyle of the game has attracted many people that never played a rougelite deckbuilder before but the difficulty in this game is not a problem at all. Is the game difficult? yes to some extend since you are required to build working synergies and actively think about your turns. This gets more complicated since the game gives you a lot more options in combat due to how the positioning and effect systems work. This is not a bad thing though and it is precisely because of the options you have paired with the relatively narrow scope of each tribes deck that you have a lot of control about what happens in combat.

Every effect and ability is cleary written on the cards and works pretty much as you would expect. There are some peculiarities that you need to work out when first encountering stuff (for example how the turn order works for cards or that units that consume allied cards will never eat the enemy leader) but after that it is always the same and reliable. I think if you read a card it is very obvious what purpose the card serves and which other cards would have good synergy with it.. Attack buffs are more valuable on multi hit targets / snow can be used to disable certain mechanics etc.

It is still a roguelite though so you will have some runs where you just dont get a working synergy ready in time for the difficulty ramp up. Due to the options the game gives you and the mentioned before relatively narrow scope of each deck these cases are rare though and can often traced back to bad decisions the player makes.

Each Enemy clan/type and boss requires some specific handeling  that you will need to keep in mind throughout the game. Many other rougelites work with optimizing builds for a hyper specific approach which employs the same strategy for every fight and then proceeds to steamroll the game. Such a thing doesnt really work here since you need to keep your approaches rather varied. If you rely completely on one slow heavy hitter you will be fucked by shielded enemies. If you build completely for rapid multi hitters you will be fucked by counter enemies (if you dont circumvent them which the game allows you to do). In short until you have a few runs under your belt and know what to expect you will create builds that have failure points. Again this is normal for this genre and part of the learning process.


The game so far has been awesome and I have had a lot of fun figuring out the best move in any given turn and many seemingly unwinnable battles were clawed back to victory not because I randomly got the RNG god card but because I managed to outplay the enemy setup turn for turn which in my opinion is much more statisfying than randomly pulling  the I win card.

The visual and sound of the game are incredible. The art for each cards and the designs of characters within the game are so cute and will appeal to everyone. The music when the game is still in its relaxed state, then intensifies in combat and boss battle are amazing. Not to mention how solid the system of the game is, every click on the card or the bell is satisfactory, interacting with map events are great (like crushing the ice to get a companion), equipping charms is always fun, and many fun interactions too. Many can be improve with QoL still, but still solid at launch.

For these alone, this game is already great. But.

Now for the elephant in the room, which the majority have already written. I also agree that the balance of the game is out of whack. It took me 8 hours of gameplay and multiple tries to finally win the game for the first time. I've since started 10+ more runs and yet to reach the final boss again (which is[spoiler] my previous run winner, and I consider that is pretty cool)[/spoiler]. And I just play this genre of game casually.

Now I still do recommend this game for its innovation on the genre and solid system overall, but definitely not for the casuals deckbuilder players. Because compared to other game in its genre, Wildfrost is like Darkest Dungeon in it's early access days. Unbalanced, Stiff (in a way, you can't play your way, you have to play how the game wants you to win), and you are slave to the RNG. You can build your deck to stack one or two effects to make it strong on the first 2 battles, but then you're gonna hit a wall where your deck is useless and you have to restart again and again and again and again.

Now the unbalance does not only applies to the gameplay, but also on how it affects the players. Sure every roguelike/lite games is about making mistakes in your early runs and learn from it so you can make improvements on your next runs. But if the majority of the run you make is a failure to learn from, then the game became a chore, because you have to learn instead of just play.

That's why in Slay the Spire have the option to make the game harder for you with the ascension system, while the basic gameplay is as easy as it comes. It is more accessible and balanced for the players that just wants to play casually and those that wants to tryhard.

That's why in Hades, you can make the game harder with modifier to torture yourself with, while the basic game is a simple hack 'n slash roguelike.

I still like this game, and willing to be crushed over and over again since I love playing roguelike/lite games (although StS is only the RL-deckbuilder I've played). But I can't deny the game is unbalanced as I've written, and I hope it can be balanced just like other game in the roguelike/lite genre.

With the game being released I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised with how the game turned out.

Wartales is a game with a lot of similarities to Expeditions: Conquistador and even a little of the Banner Saga.
At the start of the game you decide what type of initial squad and backstory you want to go with like being a bunch of wanderlust farmers wanting to seek their fortunes to former soldiers running from the war to bandits who have escaped prison. The decisions at the start helps to ground you to the world and inspire you to role play as the type of squad you chose. You get to fully customise four characters like choosing the sex, appearance and character traits, one for free but if you want two positive traits you must pick a negative trait to counter balance it. 
For example with my squad I made a big viking dude with a shield and club who was strong of arm and very stout but his negative was that he ate more food than the others because he was so big and strong.

The comparisons to Expeditions: Conquistador begin when you start moving around the map to explore and find new locations that have different quests and events tied to them as well as fight tactical battles battles on a square based grid (Expedition: Conquistador used a hex grid though) and begin to level up your companions and have some minor role play events with them as time goes on. Each area of the game has its own story/quest line and there are different endings for them. The first area of the game is a hot bed of refugees running from away from a war in another kingdom.

The comparison to Banner Saga is that initial battles are very much you take a turn then the enemy takes a turn but unlike Banner Saga you are not punished for killing enemies and as such you get more turns to use. The battle system also allows you to chose which character to use on your turn so for example you wanted to start combat with your big shield dude you could run them in first turn or you could use your archer and shoot at the back line on the first turn. This is different from most tactical games because in those games you have to take turns in a certain order but in this game you can chose the character you really want to move instead of having to wait till the end of the turn to use that really slow character.

The game is very fun to play and enthralling; it is the little moments that help make this game like when my archer Erin kept accidentally shooting the de-facto captain of my bandit group in the back and while camping he tried to have her kicked out but the other bandits said it was a mistake obviously and to forgive her just for her to shoot him in the back again in the very next encounter and for the de-factor captain to get a paranoid trait after it happened.",1.0

Another banger by Dexter Manning, its quite an interesting game which is in a sort of cartoony wacky style.
Personally i find this quite fun, as i dont usually play these sorts of games but opinions may differ
Filled with humour and simple gameplay (but varying difficulty) it provides somewhat decent gameplay but depending on experience it might be easier/harder (i find it quite hard as i dont play these kinda games)
Not really a glitch or bug, but during interplay cutscenes you can still move the character and may lead to accidental deaths but i think thats on me

1463,1463.0,1463.0,99.0,99.0,136643560.0,1527950,"I came to this one after bouncing off Band of Brothers, and this game definitely has some of the same similarities - managing a mercenary company that needs to be constantly fed and paid and dealing with the pressure to push forward against the risk of permanent loss.  It's an ironman-lovers formula, where stories told are largely generated by your decisions and the rolls of the dice. 

Wartales is much more personal, however, with your initial starting band sharing a small history you decide, and each character having particular jobs and roles in your found family of bandits, heroes, or mercenaries.  The death tolls aren't quite as high (although it's possible I'm just bad at Band of Brothers), and the personal growth of each character feels nicely paced and carefully managed.  There are all these little, simple systems that categorize how you are progressing, from your knowledge of the world leading to general party perks to each characters individual relationship.  

The best example of what Wartales is, I think, comes from a simple thing I found in the first few hours. in firing a shot from an arrow into a crowded fight, I hit an unlucky 20% and accidentally shot a companion.  This wasn't a fight ender, but it had two specific mechanical consequences: 
one, the two party members relationship deteriorated, 
and two, the wounded member developed a new perk called Eyes in the Back Of Your Head, to prevent such occurences from happening in the feature.  
That's the core of it - tight mechanical tactical combat coupled with consequences that are narrative on a personal level. 

I could speak a lot to the games seemingly open nature and the really elegant nature of its combat and experience systems, but its whats in between them that most fascinates me.  This game uses its quiet preparation time really well - despite fairly light procedural dialog, the small systems interlock in a way to create a sense of family and camraderie in your little band that feels meaningful.  Because of the non combat class system the characters you're risking aren't fully featureless fighters - they're also the ones that cook your meals, or smith your weapons, or do your laundering.  They're people that  you care about.  That's a hard trick to pull in a game of this style, and its definitely worth price of purchase even if you're only in for a few runs.

Just now I played the full release for a few minutes and I can tell it is something special. The music score is amazing, the art is amazing, and the vibe and style just feel so damn good. It's almost like a Little Nightmare vibe with some Inside but all morphed into a dope FPS shooter + with it's own jam. On that note the controls are tight and the shooting is spot on. There is a jumping mechanic and puzzles and secrets so that will keep you busy and not just focus on grinding the trigger. Also gibbing enemies is like a pimp pancake breakfast you keep wanting more. It all just feels really good.

Another note the blood effects and lighting all are super nice and it adds a lot to the game. It's a UE4 game and I have perfect performance with no stutters what so ever or shader issues so that is pretty cool.

Note - if you play with a gamepad(XB360, XB1 or XBSX) and want to invert the thumb just get Xbox Accessories from the MS store and just make and activate a profile to fix the game.

Game has some interesting art design kind of like a Psychonauts/Little Nightmares/Tim Burton FPS. Halfway decent controller support, which is important as have been playing it in full 6DOF VR with a Quest 2 over link cable.

Works out of the box well with the upcoming Universal Unreal VR injector from praydog. With the recent addition of a toggle for head locked aiming this is pretty fun to play like that. Would be a good candidate to add further motion controls to as well. 

Game is pretty difficult even on Easy and relies on you to use the manual quick save/ quick load system. Think the default game-pad mapping is okay but is better when the jump button is on a trigger or shoulder button. Would help if the quick save and quick load buttons were also on the controller as well.

Has ten levels, each with hidden secrets, can be replayed with harder difficulties and modifiers. Has a gun that shoots leeches :)

1) rebuying all your tables if you had them on the FX3 version, is meh, i can understand why they ask for money (license of the tables and and IPs etc) 

2) pinball pass might seem cheaper but dont let that fool you, the automatic activation of the 1 day trial even after you skip the tutorial (isnt it the reward from it)

3) the physics seems way off (regular and pro), regular is floaty like a gummybear on a trampoline, and pro's nudging is too sensetive two nudges relatively fast after each other and instant tilt & no warning, especially hurtfull if you use a controller (irl i can drag save a machine a inch or two (5cm) in tournement settings and still not get tilt or a tilt warning).

4) issues that carried over from the epic version , Keybinds constantly reseting after a restart of the game, Event tournements like ""flip challenge"" and ""time challenge"" ending early.

5) Some of the models on tables look worse than on a VPX recreation it

only good things i can tell, aleast its easier to play with controller on steam than on epic, and maybe the original zen tables (some like em , some dont).

The combat is really fluid and responsive, and you need to be careful with your attacks, dash through incoming attacks, and combo your enemies to death. Some tougher ones can even be stunned with an extra stun bar.

It gets more risky in some rooms where you get swarmed by several at once, and need to properly strategize some crowd control.
Once you beat the first boss and meet the second character, Kera, the game and challenges really open up. Kera has lots of melee combos available. And the third one’s gameplay feels more bullet-hell, with long range aiming.
You still have to get in close, as all the better/special weapons use an energy bar, which only gets filled when you use your main weapon.

Run lengths are not too long, from 7-15 minutes per stage, but it’s well worth exploring the whole map, to increase the power level and get better weapons.
The mods are pretty basic right now, but maybe they'll add more special ones or some clearer synergies.

Interesting setting, very good art direction/asset quality/animations for an indie.  Currently it's a bit basic in its initial early access state, but it's clear that the game has potential to turn into a very solid metroidvania/roguelite.

There are 3 ""worlds"" with the main character having a different version of herself for each one (though functionally this doesn't amount to much yet).  As you beat the boss of each world you unlock a new traversal ability for that specific character.  You gain 2 different meta-resources (orange and blue) to help you strengthen your upgrades, though currently they are pretty lackluster, just minor stat increases.  Orange unlocks new upgrades to be purchased or increases your upgrade slots, blue is what you use to purchase the upgrades.  The second tier of upgrades includes a revive, very useful, work towards that ASAP.

The ""fusion"" mechanic isn't really fleshed out at the moment.  In later updates it looks like the 3 different worlds will be fused together in a way that promotes more thoughtful planning and preparation from the player.  Currently, you can find a terminal in a run to ""fuse"" with one of the other 2 versions of yourself from the other worlds, increasing your health, granting you one of their spells/abilities, traversal ability and giving you a new unique look for the remainder of the run.  It's a nice touch, I just wish it was more accessible and more than just a flat combination of the 2 characters.  So far nothing is in the game that requires you to have 2 different traversal abilities, but it's clear to see how it will be utilized in the future (hopefully).

All in all it's a fun enough game while it lasts.  The current state of the game is somewhat short, I got to the end of the current content in around 4-6 hours (a good understanding of how to dodge enemies will almost trivialize the game and shorten your playtime) but I enjoyed what I played.  

Looking forward to the games progress.",1.0

I wish the grappling hook was easier to use. I think punishing you with damage for falling is a mistake in this kind of game, with novel and awkward controls.

Bosses are pretty challenging not because they are particularly inspired in design, but due to the small boss arenas, big hurt box on your character, and reliance on clunky grapple controls. After 4 hours I still haven't really got the hang of using grappling in combat.

Overall, 8/10 game for me. Some quality of life improvements would be greatly appreciated, but not necessary to complete the game. This is a breath of fresh air in a sea of uninspired games.",1.0

1575,1575.0,1575.0,211.0,211.0,136618772.0,1811990,"As someone who's constantly looking for new deckbuilders to try out, I was really excited to check out Wildfrost's demo earlier this year. The game combined an adorable artstyle with a high difficulty where it's uncertain whether or not you'll make it one third of the way into the run. The full game did not disappoint me at all -- compared to the demo, the runs have been expanded to include 2 more acts, and there many unlockables for future playthroughs.


The game features wonderful artwork with a cartoony cel-shaded artstyle. All of the character cards have a personality to them, and I was surprised to see that some of the cards would change their appearance depending on actions you take in combat. Blood would splatter on their fronts, a monster would grow depending on how enraged it got and an ally would increase the size of the snowball in their hands after you power her up.

Added to that are various interactive UI elements that react to your actions -- bell relics swing and produce noise when you hover your mouse over them, upgrades are presented as trinkets on a keychain that you can attacks to your units. The various locations you visit also have satisfying animations for interacting with them, be it breaking a slab of ice or feeding your cards to Muncher. This makes the game really fun from an aesthetic point of view, it's simply a joy to look around the interface.


The combat itself seems to be an involved version of an autobatter: you play down unit cards, and they automatically attack targets (or use abilities) after their cooldown is complete. In addition to that, you can play skill cards to influence the battlefield yourself, applying status effects and doing direct damage to units. In between turns, you're free to move any and all of your units around the field, choosing who is going to be at the front to take damage, who can be sacrificed to the incoming heavy hit, and who should be sent back to your deck to recover some hitpoints. Other than these actions, each card you play takes exactly 1 turn to resolve, causing enemies to act immediately, even before your own units.

This causes the game to be all about reacting to the puzzle presented in front of you on each of the turns. How do you take the least amount of damage? How can you kill the most enemies in a single turn, as doing so makes them drop more loot? Can you afford to leave this character out, or should you play it safe and heal it up, resetting its attack timer and having to play it out again later?


The downside of this, is that the battlefield can get rather complex, with multiple enemies and allies triggering each other's abilities, some of which might be unclear to a new player or someone who's not in the mind to pay complete attention to the game. I have lost several runs simply because I forgot about a keyword an enemy had, causing them to hit my hero instead of the default target and losing me the game. The combat is unforgiving -- you're not given warnings or previews about the following turn, though you do get a battlelog where you can see what went wrong. One mishap that kills your hero, and you need to start over (or close the game to reset the combat if you don't mind cheating).


Once you're dead, the game will show you the progress you've made towards unlocking new content. You can get different units to add to your starter deck, which are pets in this game; you can unlock new charms to find in your runs, which represent the game's upgrades; you can also unlock new locations to visit during a run and new factions to play, which feature their own decks and playstyles. 

I'm personally not a fan of meta-progression in games, though I think the way Wildfrost does it is fairly fun. At the same time I do feel that putting some of the encounters behind an unlock barrier feels a little unsatisfying to me. Additionally, the way the game's ""hub"" is organized is that you have ~8 different buildings. After you click on one of them, the NPC inside will show you what type of unlock you can get, and what you need to do to get it. This means that if you want to see all of the challenges you need to complete, you have to keep clicking back and forth between these locations -- and they're spread out all around the screen in a scrollable scene in buildings that aren't easy (for me) to identify the purpose of at a glance.

I would love it if there was a list detailing all the quests in a single menu screen, like the one they have for achievements, and if there was a side panel using which you could switch between all of the buildings without having to scroll or look for the right one.

The game's ""ascension"" mode where you increase the difficulty of the game after completing it is also quite interesting -- you both get penalties and boosts for doing so. The first two difficulty increases make it so enemies have a chance to be upgraded (while dropping more gold) and the waves come out one turn quicker (but your starting unit is played down for free on the first turn).


Having enjoyed this game so much, it was a surprise to me just how many people found it unfun. I read the reviews stating that this is one of the worst deckbuilders around, that it has no sense of balance, that no matter how you build or upgrade your deck, you're bound to lose due to how much stronger the enemies are, that there is absolutely no variety in viable builds. Now, usually I wouldn't fanboy over a game I like just because it received harsh criticism, however, in this case it feels to me that the reviews like that are misleading.


My opinion is that the game's balance is fine. I was capable of winning my run immediately after finishing the tutorial, but I lost because of a mistake. I won my first run on my 4th attempt, and my second one on an increased difficulty on my 10th attempt. The majority of my losses were down to me not fining a solid end-game strategy by the middle of act 2, or because I didn't pay enough attention and got my hero killed. Both of these are fine in this line of games -- you're not [b]meant[/b] to win every run. Some runs are you barely scraping by with a semblance of a deck you cobbled together, while others have you farm a ton of gold with an absurd build you were given. 

The deck variety felt good. It seems to me that you can win using a variety of strategies, [b]however[/b] the game will not let you win if you put all of your eggs in one basket. You're not going to win with a ""poison deck"" because that's likely to be weak against many smaller units, or with a ""thorns deck"" because that's weak against high-hitting enemies, or with a ""heal deck"" because you can't heal if you're dead to a 40 damage attack.


The game will present challenges to you, and you need to be able to answer them appropriately -- you need to tank damage, to kill many small enemies quickly, to kill single large enemies, to put all your pieces on the board, etc. The way to do that is to know what challenges you'll be presented with, and what answers you can use against those challenges, both of which require knowing the game. Of course, sometimes you don't find the best answer, so you might have to settle for some mid option instead, but that's kind of the appeal of roguelikes to me. This mindset helped me get through all of my winning (or close-to-winning) runs, and it is what I feel many people who are dissatisfied with the game's balance are missing.",1.0
1580,1580.0,1580.0,216.0,216.0,136677173.0,1811990,"Want to open by saying Gaziter's art is great. I wishlisted the game because of the art so the game being really good too just makes it even better.

The game itself is an Excellent rougelike deck builder, very unique compared to the other big ones on the market. Much harder than many I've played too, which is great. 

Many of the complaints from other reviews come from not realizing that the game play is a lot more like a puzzle with a lot of moving pieces you have to solve from turn to turn, rather than more straight forward damage calculations (although those are there too). The game demands a lot more precision each turn than most other deck builders, (even Spire until you hit higher ascension levels).

You can definitely brute force some very strong combos, but the game puts a big premium on planning ahead for specific threats, and you wont get good at that until youve lost a good few runs.

Another thing I've noticed after several dozen runs is that while leaders feel weak, I've actually been getting more robust and useful ones now that I've unlocked a good bit of the meta progression. I don't know of they're set to scale up based on your unlocks or if I'm just getting more comfortable with the game so I see the value in things I dismissed before. (I suspect its a bit of both.

Lastly, some things definitely are over or under tuned. Bigfoots are pretty insane and demand an immediate answer. A few player cards could probably stand to have their numbers bumped. One thing I'd really like to see is more cards that don't use up your turn. Not too many, one to three at most. The flow of the turns is really strong as it is, but I think being able to play more than one card per turn almost doubles the decision space that turn, which is really interesting if its not every turn.",1.0

[b]Why this game is different[/b]
I've played hundreds of alpha/beta/ea/released indie shooters over the years. There is a pattern that I've noticed with most of the games that failed: The second there was creative deviation away from the status quo, these studios would immediately make bad decisions. Round-based TDM, revives in respawn gamemodes, operator lock-in in casual gamemodes, removal of jump in a fast paced shooter, gimmicks, semi fire assault rifles by default, asthma inspired stamina systems, overpowered damage-based abilities, etc.

These ideas seem to go through a studio, without any protest. No one at these studios thinks ""hey, maybe we should add a scrollbar to our in-game chat"". It erodes trust in the developers and makes me not want to invest into their game in the long term.


[b]What the game does right[/b]
Boundary innovated a ton in this game, and they didn't make any simular mistakes. The game is pretty, the UI is incredible, progression is addictive, gamemodes are fun, the animations are smooth, audio is immersive, balance is sensible, their handling of playtests was professional, settings carried over from previous playtests, suggestions are being listened to and their communication is fantastic.

The grapple and movement module are a blast, recoil of snipers boosts your speed and emps make you spin. You can pop balloons that blow you away, there are small crates floating in spawn that you can push around and use as cover and you can pressurize rooms which blow enemies away when they open its doors. Even their weirdest gimmicks work out.


[b]When it does go wrong, the team still rocks[/b]
Every developer creates bugs. There are some crashes, bugs, the lobby system has some quirks, and there is performance spikes on some maps. You could even include minor gripes like mostly static spawns. There are some grammatical errors, but if anything they're cute and the community has adopted them. (panta kill enjoyer)

The way the team handled problems is professional and reasonable (even their replies on the steam reviews here). After the rocky launch, the team kept players up to date through their discord. After some fixes, the team gave out 2 ""compensation cosmetics"" as a reward for peoples patience. When VC was broken, they quickly disabled it until it was fixed. The team has stocked up post-launch (played during the beta) content so the game isn't dead right out of the gate.


I would absolutely say that this game is worth buying. Its fun, addictive and high quality. I also feel like the good progression system and the post-launch content can keep the game relevant for long enough. The developers deserve much more respect for all the things they did right (which is most of it)",1.0

1604,1604.0,1604.0,13.0,13.0,136675546.0,1364020,"THE GOOD:
The zero G and gunplay feels fantastic, plus the audio editing, though a little choppy, REALLY works well for the intensity and immersion. the gunplay is very similar to Titanfall 2's PVP, especially in terms of movement and the TTK, which feels juuuust right to me. Especially when the matches get intense, and you're rushing and making those split second decisions, the game's truly firing on all cylinders, and one i don't feel like stopping. 

The movement is something I've never experienced before, and it just clicks with you after like 10 minutes. Actively taking engagements, feels great! But there's always the possibility to play defensive with snipers and AR's, moving in a disciplined format, cover to cover through hallways. Although camping here will simply not work, since if you're near an enemy, you'll hear a pinging sound to guide you to them, and vice versa. Long range engagements a la battlefield, is still a possibility. 

Balance wise I can't comment, but I've not experienced any unfair fights or guns so far. Everything's got a place, although i DO wish snipers and DMR's got a buff, cause DMRs are they are, are a little too weak, and downright detrimental closer than 20 metres. 

Playing as Spike (stealth CQC lady who leaves a smoke bomb like a squid to evade), just grapple-hooking, stealthing and bum-rushing with a shotgun has no business feeling as addictive as it is. 

And the visuals? Incredible.

I'm playing this from India, on southeast Asian servers, so I've encountered none of the ping issues mentioned in other reviews, and while firefights are often too overstimulating at times, they haven't felt unfair to me in the 15ish games i've played. Plus, it helps that getting a match here, at the time barely takes 5 seconds (all modes are 5v5, and variations of TDM, TDM without respawns, Capture-The-Flag, Site Control, and Bomb-planting)

THE BAD: 
A lot of the translations in the game clearly come from Google translate, like ""Magazine"" is called Ammo Storage Device, and there's little misspellings everywhere. And the updates on steam come in english, but in game they're still in chinese. 
Plus, there's no tutorials on character abilities yet, so you'll need to just trial-and-error your way to grasping them, but that's not too difficult. 

The content is obviously very narrow. Granted the game modes are immensely fun, and the map design has a LOT to give, a lot of the maps are just ""Some space complex above the earth's atmosphere"" and so while they differ in structure, there's little visual changes. 

There's quite some visual bugs, with slow-loading textures, and texture pop in every now and then. With how much detail there is to sift through anyways, this can often get annoying and make you miss enemies which can and will result in deaths that you didn't deserve. I get that it's early access, so this is probably among the more stable games, but still. 

Someone mentioned something about the anticheat reading programs accessing your RAM or something? And how they can ban you from the game if they find sus activities, but someone who understands computers better than me can speak to its quality.

TLDR: I'm deeply deeply hoping this game's able to grow and get better for players in different continents as well, cause the localization as is, is bad, but functional. Once it gets a healthy dose of more content, and longer matches, it'll go HARD. It's worth the price as it is, and there's insane potential here. I can see this becoming one of those niche favorites like Insurgency and the like one day, fingers crossed it does. 8.5/10",1.0

This is a visual novel / dating sim where you are a writer trying to make a go in Hollywood.

Definitely hits true for the writer gig a few times, rather painfully so even, at least from my limited experience. Also seems to have a good amount of elements tracked behind the scenes, which I really like - I've always kind of felt that in game stat screens for character stats and romantic interest while a commonality to most games presented a lot of surreality, so kind of liked that those things were present but secret for this game.
Honestly had some trouble coming up with cons to the game - its early access, what I'd assume is just the first episode of the game, so it is relatively short. The price tag is sadly about average for these sorts of games these days. Now, some of you may not like that there is really no sexual content that I am aware of at least, from my play through at least. Honestly, I'm fine with that; likely some in future episodes, though I don't think there needs to be a ton. A stronger story and immerisve experience makes up for any short coming there, easily.

And I'm out of pros actually.
Most of positive reviewers will write that a lot of reviews are just complains about prices - and that is true!
But let's face things: you won't like to play only free tables and tablepass that devs give you is just a mockery, because, it don't even grant access to all tables! Some of them allow just 2 minute trial mode!
And that's why this is a review with complaining about price policy.
I don't want to pay MORE for EXACT SAME tables that are present in FX3 (majority of which I bought during Xmas sale in 2022) and I can't recommend to do this to anyone, unless you have irresistible desire to spend your money ""just because"". The legacy bundles costs just unfair in my opinion. Again, I compared Ghost Rider table in FX and in FX3 and it feels just the same - maybe, just maybe, Williams tables worth to pay again for them. I just wasn't prepared that tablepass will be  activated instantly upon receiving and I can't play a lot during workday.
Also, would be nice to highlight that the prices on tables in ewwwwwwgs is lower that in Steam (after a year of being an exclusive) which is also embarrassing.

And so, in the end, we have nice update of the platform, which works fine on portable devices. More smooth gameplay. But without tables - it just lose sense to jump in this version, especially, if you have plenty of great table owned in FX3. I think, you won't miss a thing.",0.0

Some pretty cool table designs in PFX though, am a fan of the godzilla license and Crypt of the Necrodancer

...seriously, Zen, if you guys want to keep your audience, let us keep our damn tables, remaster or no. Nobody is going to buy Secrets of the Deep for a third time, even half off. Especially not with the physics in this game being so bad.

Pros: 
- Graphics remaster looks nice
- Puzzles are good fun (Drove me insane)
- Game play feels nice 
- 100% is easily  done

I would also recommend a ""hover over"" indicator of who is doing damage to what row, as it can be a little difficult to grasp.

I also had runs where I was confident in making it to the end and ultimately lost due to hindsight in letting my leader die. And then, there are runs where the synergies turn the game from a 7 to an 11 as I dominate with 4, 3x attacking Big Berry because yes, it just works.

As a veteran to the roguelike genre, this game is definitely more tricky than the usual roguelike I have played, however, it's definitely a game you can consistently do well in. On my first run alone, I made it pass the second boss. Now, I have beaten the true final boss in only 8 hours of playing with 10 total runs played. What I've learned is that healing is notoriously a tried and tested strategy to guarantee you will make it far. But you should also focus on doing 4 things: racking up money (usually from combo kills and money event space) so that you can buy crowns to set up your forces and combos asap, taking events in this priority order - Money/Shop>Helper(if it isnt capped)>Card removal>Relic>Chest (card reward), focus on 1 type of synergy for your deck that corresponds to your clan, and do not take any cards with side effect with them. If you take these things into account, you'll make it far even if you make a mistake or didn't plan well. 

Imo, this game is relatively simpler compared to other roguelike I have played so it's easy to start to learn what works and what doesn't. This game has alot to offer once you get a grasp of how to play and it's only uphill there on.",1.0

Each puzzle has two little rooms where you need to find the cat. Well, finding the cat isn't really a challenge because it is usually visible in most scenes. How to get to it is the true challenge.

What you need to do is switch between two scenes, find items and use them at the right spot. Scenes are very tiny and usually have one or two items and some piece of furniture that can be opened. 

Red herrings that reset the entire puzzle make the puzzles a little trickier. These can take the form of a puppy that jumps out when the door is opened, an electric outlet that shocks you, and even a ghost lady looking out of a well.

Certain situations are incredibly intriguing and unexpected. Although some scenarios are repeated, each problem contains enough fresh material to keep you from ever feeling as though you have seen it before.

There’s also a secondary mode where you play with cat, buy it food and toys, and earn money for even more stuff.

16 play hours later and over 70 straight losses and I cannot help but wonder if there is a code to counter your deck in particular instances to increase the length of the game and if that bugged out on some of us because there cannot possibly be a perfect counter every single run.

Others have mentioned it, you build a deck type and you WILL face the direct counter to it. Now you may think, ""I can just overcome the counter, right?""

People complaining about the difficulty are being absurd. It´s what actually makes this game fun! The choices you make, the paths you take, the cards you upgrade, what you play, how you position your troops, it ALL IS VITAL and will change the outcome of your run! 

People want games with meaningful choices and strategy but once they make bad decisions, they call it too difficult. 
80% of my runs have failed because I made a dumb decision and the game punished me for it. This makes it super fun, though. With every run I´ve unlocked new things, keeping the content fresh! And with every dumb choice I make, I learn from my mistakes and get further in the next attempt.

The tribes you can play are incredibly varied and play very differently. 
Heroes, companions, charms and cards with a dozen varying effects make combos and strategies super fun and somewhat unique every run.
The progressive unlocking of cards, charms (card upgrades), companions keeps the incentive to re-run interesting and high.

My only complaint is that some effects are somewhat unclear and require testing to understand. A few of my runs were ruined by this issue. Part of the learning process but it would also just be easier if it was specified how certain effects affect results. Same thing with not being able to see if you´ve reached your companion limit.

This game reminds me a lot of Slay the Spire and The Darkest Dungeon, with how strategic you need to be and with some level of RNG that's involved. However, I will say this game looks and feels quite polished compared to the two, as it feels more fluid. The art style is quite nice to look at and the story/characters you come along as interesting as a whole. However, if I had one thing to say about this game to sum it up, it's that it's very very difficult. It took me a good few hours just to figure out a few mechanics that aren’t told to you, and the learning curve is very steep for new players. I'm not a god at the game but if you take your time to figure out different combinations and paths you can take it's very rewarding. I would say that perhaps it is too harsh for newcomers to this type of game and the beginning can be more forgiving, however other than that I do enjoy this quite a bit, and I do believe everyone should give it a try at least once.

In its current state, the game could use some optimization on some lesser hardware and there is a strange issue where there is occasional input lag that can be quite frustrating, but it's not common enough to be a deal breaker and somethign that should probably be ironed out in future patches.

The only feature that feels sorely missing is VR support. Anybody who has ever experienced pinball in VR is probably aware that it's a bummer going back to a flat screen where you just never get the perfect camera angle versus feeling like you are actually standing at a real 3D machine using your head naturally as the camera.

however as much as i enjoy this game, their remains a problem of players using wall hacks, not to shoot through walls or anything but to know your position some may disagree with this, but having witnessed it in multiple matches it is their, and some people are using it, as to which it get's to a point of this just isn't fun, so i enjoy this but find myself being put off playing it with the fact that in 6 hours of play i have encountered around 4-5 people using said cheats, 
that is the only con to this game,

the playerbase are all really friendly and get along except for the ones who forget to unmute all of us have done it at least once XD.

the gunplay is nice and smooth the movement and all is good, they also have a shooting range available at the menu where you select what you wish to do just turn left, their is also a pre-lobby between matches with basketball, a bar, and just a place to interact with teammates and the opposition.

 £25 was a steep jump in price for what is currently their but as they add to the game the price would 100% be worth it, provided they start dealing with these cheaters, permanent bans would be the way showing them if they wish to cheat they have to purchase it again on a new account, i do recommend the game if you dont mind running into those sorts of people occasionally, but if that sorta thing really get's to you i'd avoid at that point, this is just my opinion",1.0

I'm torn with this game, i did like it and it was scary, but i think it was mainly the visuals. The free roam was a great feature, i really enjoyed wandering around and looking at the environment because it is very beautiful. I didn't go back in the house in free roam so i guess it was a pretty spooky setup. 

By the way if you haven't, make sure you explore in free roam, there are a bunch of Easter Eggs. It's also full of beautiful visuals, honestly it's worth the few bucks for the free roam.

2013,184.0,,,,136741934.0,1811990,"The game really doesn't feel fair to play.

I have a LOT of hours into Slay the Spire, Roguebook, and many other card games. It is entirely unbalanced, there's basically no point in withdrawing cards into the pouch to heal them, as there's zero chance you'll still be alive by the time you can use them again.

Your start is entirely random, and you will outright lose almost every game based on the selection of leaders and misc crap you are then given.

In something like Slay the Spire, Roguebook, or Monster Train, if you lose MOST of the time it is due to a misplay, or not following through on a strategy. Occasionally or rarely it is due to bad luck. In this game, there's no way to (consistently) heal your character, and you get one of three choices of leaders, all of which are usually bad in my experience, they either do no damage, have aimless (which will mean when they DO attack they attack at random), or are just mediocre. If your leader dies the run ends. Enemies have very high HP, you will get to pick between 1-2 cards generally between fights, every fight has a boss, and depending on the RNG of what you draw at the start, you can lose pretty much from the get-go.

For example, I get no snowballs (the only way to delay enemy turns), no allies, and am fighting the monkey boss. One of the minor enemy monkeys has 8 hp, attacks every round, and gains 1 damage every round starting from zero. The problem? In my case it takes 4 turns for my character to attack for 4 damage, they have like 9 hp, in that timespan the monkey has hit me for 6 damage, and if I had no attack cards it is only at half hp, while i am down to 3 hp, with no consistent way to heal.

Keep in mind there'll be another like 5 enemies that will spawn in during that time, and on the round I can attack, I'll be attacked by the boss, the monkey that is much stronger than the boss, and all the other misc. enemies.",0.0

Nine updates later, and here we are, one of the most addicting games I've ever played.

During Early Access, Shiro kept everyone in the loop with an updated roadmap that showed what updates were going to be released when, and then Shiro overdelivered on time, every time. I can't stress that part enough, they never missed a deadline. This game was always getting updates and those updates were GOOD.

I understand people who complain about the previous Epic Store exclusivity or the current pricing (the tables are more expensive than with FX3 and owners of the FX3 tables only get half-off the normal price) - but keep in mind that pinball is and always was a niche and probably will stay that. There simply aren't that many  potential buyers and the developers still need to earn a living. Zen definitely put hard work and some love into the product.

2042,213.0,,,,136740118.0,1651560,"There's a great foundation which also uses (foundation's) territorial system here but some stuff is lacking per say , pacing is tacky and some stuff is just weird.

Pro's - Unique systems and charming laid back art direction its super charming + relaxing. There's lots of potential here (hopefully it delivers)

Con's - pacing is tacky - to put it mildly  the concept is there for food and gold etc. which are kinda basic , but the timing and cost of it encourages a super slow play style which might not be for everyone.

Desirability - buildings have upkeep and certain heavier industries give or reduce desirability/beauty of a certain spot. Having high desirability increases happiness of the housing in the area- leading to a faster immigration rate i think at least) but really don't affect anything besides that so far.

Cost- The cost of buildings lends to its slow play style , buildings are pricey at the start and taxes are fixed, ie the initial farm of vegetables cost you 225 gold for the max of 40 fields, a single homestead for 3 peasants (2 workers) costs about 55 gold , with a ratio of 2-3 peasant houses giving enough cash to reach double digits + support the upkeep of one building that needs it.


Food- It aint fully there yet, (fish comes in the future updates it says) + each food type gives its own number of food needs fulfilled . I.e wheat requires 2 processes to become bread - but has about double the food fulfillment compared to vegetables which don't need any processes to be used. The main problem is the ratio of the wheat products - you need 2 or 3 wheat units for one unit of flour, but 4 flour for 1 unit of bread, or just 4 units of wheat for pork (requiring a herd), this means essentially a super high scaling cost of a 1000 or more to get it to a stable supply for the next tier of citizens .

2. Its almost impossible to tell how far an enemy could be walking and whether or not he could be in range to attack your characters on the next turn, would be good if you could see their walking/attack range when hovering or selecting enemies
3. Would be nice to have a UI scaling setting, so that texts are a bit easier to read on bigger screens

I have played quite a lot of retro games with my deck like other Mega Man collections, Castlevania collections and Megadrive collection. Others have worked quite well, but somehow MMBN feels special. It's kind of like the game has been all these years waiting for a little bigger screen and option to choose from multiple controller choices (I like to use touchpad).",1.0

Got stuck at a point where I had to shoot on a solid door that apparently was one way-glass with a really small ""fragile"" text in the bottom of it. Before that I walked back and forth trying to figure out if it was some kind of puzzle element with the 2 switches in the game which you could turn on and off, the only thing that did was confuse me making me believe one had to be turned on and the other off to progress.

When I played the game I was forced to join the discord and type a stupid command to get a code if i wanted to progress in the game. This has apparently been fixed now in a recent patch which is a good thing.
There is nothing chasing you 97% of the game, the only ""chase"" sequence is in the end in a maze which lasts about 1 minute.
I would say the graphics, sound and lighting are the only good things with this game and the fact that it is free. 
The developers have another game upcoming based on this so I would like to assume this is a kind of demo of the upcoming game but if that is the case I think it should be stated on the store page which gives you less expectations of an actual game.",0.0

It's very difficult and mistakes are punishing but in my opinion this is a big part of what makes it so addictive!  It's crazy to me that anyone would leave a negative review as clearly a ton of thought and effort went into this game.

2090,261.0,,,,136743147.0,1649740,"Hunt the Night is a souls inspired 2D action RPG with some platforming and shooting elements. It is a relatively short game that can be beaten in around 10 hours but can be further extended if you are going for 100% or new game+. below are some short pros and cons for the game.

PROS:
- The controls are responsive and dodge timings are tight but intuitive.
- The shifting between melee and gun combat is pretty nice and the ammo system is not to punishing
- Aside from 1 boss [spoiler] mother [/spoiler], I find them to be fun, have good auditory and visual cues, and have amazing designs.
- The enemy scaling is pretty good, you can beat the game with the starting equipment on a first playthrough.
- I know people are pretty mixed on this, but I really liked the puzzles as it doesn't hand hold you and 1 of them was down right cryptic.
CONS:
- I find most of the mechanics underdeveloped, I never use grenades as they are too clunky and deal little to no damage; the crossbow is inferior to the pistol and shotgun; and poison and burn don't deal enough damage or proc enough to warrant a build dedicated to them.
- Exploration is a pain in the ass. You don't have map or a collectible checklist, and a good portion of the early game is a swamp that needed a special unlock to traverse through.
- Story is pretty mediocre; I wasn't really invested, and the lore is pretty much all over the place.
- Music is okay, I wasn't impressed nor disappointed.
- Some bounty bosses are buggy; I bum rushed 2 of them and they died getting stun-locked by sword slashes.

Overall, I find the game enjoyable, albeit unpolished for the most part. If you are looking for a short game to binge through, but still want a decent challenge, then I highly recommend playing this game.",1.0

Where it differs is that in this game, I feel so much more agency when it comes to how my unit hit. There are several ways to improve your hit chances and make it much more likely that you'll connect, to the point where I almost never worry about taking a shot unless I'm basically certain it'll connect. Variability comes with damage, enemy armor, and use of cover and clever tactics. There's also a resource management element where you need to collect loot as you fight and flee, so that you can heal or upgrade in between fights. The core loop is just perfect. It also has a nice aesthetic, and an intriguing world. The narrative does seem simplistic, but it's a good enough framing device to get you in the action.

At this time of the review i'm done with one of the 10 games and here are some notable change worth mentioning:

- Gameplay is just as smooth as the original, it's a great port on that regard
- Art Gallery, Music Player, they're fine whatever, you'll spend 5 mins in there and be over it. Mostly nice to see once.

Game Buster Max breaks the game. It takes away every challenge. Which if you're a veteran and simply want to speed through the game I guess is fine, also if you want to speed up grinding for chip collection, but I find myself with the Batman corollary as in, if i use it now, why not use it all the time? And well, it kills every enemies in less than seconds can count on your end battle report card. If it's your first time playing the game, please don't turn on this feature, it takes away a lot of how amazing the battle system in this franchise is. 

Beyond that, it's the same as the games on Gameboy Advance, except now you get access to the rare chips from the start and there's achievements to accomplish which adds flavor.

So far I've completed the game by just maxing shadow claw as I didn't find the other skills useful such as the red bubbles and book. While other skills such as the skill that wipes enemies and the music notes is OP in comparison to other skills that are lacking. 

If balancing is done right, players can make good combos with other skills and thus creating a more immersive bullet hell experience. Bring more levels and increase complexity to the game. Create more modes (endless, fixed time, etc.). Add pixelated Nicholas Cage. Also improve design options.

So having played in the open alpha and beta play tests, and now owning the game since release. I would say it's a pretty decent game as it stands and I do recommend getting it for yourself. (At the time of writing this the game has only been out for barely two days and more updates are to come so keep this in mind.)

Here's a couple of things I've noticed since launch.

[b]1.) Spacial Audio Issues [/b]
Now since the play tests to the now fully released game, I will admit the audio has gotten loads better. But there is definitely still some issues when it comes to hearing your team members foot steps much easier than the enemy's foot steps, even when they're almost right next to you. The audio for team and enemy foot steps should either be the same volume, or switched.

[b]2.) Where'd the Compass go? [/b]
There was a compass that used to be attached to your wrist making it easier for you to communicate with your team mates as to which direction to enter the building from (attacking), or say where they're entering from (defending). I haven't fully gone through the settings again to see if they've made it so you can toggle it on your wrist or not yet so this might change.

[b]3.) No Tutorial for New Players [/b]
At this current moment in time the only way for someone to learn the game is ""trial by fire"" in a sense. They're basically having to rely on team members to understand the game mechanics and how they work. Even something like tool tips would be helpful, and maybe just adding a toggle in the settings to disable them.

[b]4.) Gun Play [/b]
The gun play is actually quite nice for a newer VR Tact-Shooter, and it's quite refreshing if I'm being honest. It's very rewarding for hitting head shots. So for all the VR shooter head hunters out there, you'll have a great time with this game.

[b]5.) The Community [/b]
The community is absolutely amazing. Obviously you're going to run into kids being this game is on both PCVR and Quest. But when you're in the right lobby, it could be the highlight of your day (or the absolute rock bottom depending on which side you got).


[h2]T.L.D.R. [/h2]

With Breachers only having been released for two days, for what it is I couldn't recommend it more right now. It is honestly enjoyable (all be it with the issues it has). As stated prior the community is great, the developers are working hard on updating the game while talking with the community and getting their input as to what people want/like the most about the game.

This might not seem like much but when the game expects you to play through the runs at least 100 times to unlock everything, you notice. The second issue is that the game is random about what cards it gives you, but there aren't enough to pick from or maybe just enough in general because trying to build to apply a specific status or do a specific thing is almost impossible and many of the quests require you to do so in order to complete them.

2185,356.0,,,,136753374.0,307950,"I have played Caliber since August 2022 prior to the Steam launch.

Great game overall for being F2P, good PVE/PVP 3rd person gameplay if you're looking for something that is similar to Ghost Recon Phantoms (RIP) or the old SOCOM games. 
Continuous regular updates for bugfixes/balancing and good communication with the Caliber team on discord.
Wasn't expecting much from it when I first started as it just seemed like one of those lower budget random foreign games but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of it (graphics are good, lots of different mechanics, somewhat authentic operator designs from multiple different countries that you can tell the devs researched with some effort, etc). 

As it is F2P, has a lot of monetization stuff to make your progress a lot quicker, which is annoying but expected of course. It is ""pay for convenience"" but not ""pay to win"".

Pros:
- Graphics and character designs are pretty good.
- Gameplay variety (has PVE, PVPVE, PVP and limited special gamemodes)
- PVE isn't super easy even on lowest difficulty (you will die if you aren't paying attention or taking cover)
- Large variety of different operators with different abilities, you have to level up operators by playing them to improve their abilities and make them more viable. Different operators have different play-styles and strategy.
- Good communication with Caliber team (I personally saw a design error on an operator skin with an upside down NVG mount, brought it up on Discord with a screenshot, and the design was fixed within an update or two).
- Very fun when playing as team and actually communicating. Bring your friends. Sometimes sucks though if solo-queuing and your team has braindeads/leavers or doesn't communicate at all.

Cons:
- A lot of monetization that reduces your grinding. It is expected as game is F2P, but some of the real money prices for certain things are super high, such as $10-20 USD for a new operator to play (there are currently 68 operators, some are more expensive than others). You can grind for ingame credits by winning and doing challenges but it will probably take a couple days to grind out enough to buy one operator. I believe when you start out and do all the tutorials and stuff you have enough for a few operators to start out with though. Try them out at the Firing Range before you decide on what to buy / play as for awhile if you aren't going to drop real cash on the game.
- Often has toxic players in PVP who get mad and quit if you lose a round (annoying, as this game is 4v4 you will be at a significant disadvantage).
- High ping if you aren't in Russia. I believe this is less of a problem now as they have added back in US and EU servers.
- Some balancing issues with operators.
- Battlepass system is weird. Very expensive, comes in multiple different parts that are paid for separately, takes awhile to level, and the operators obtained from the end of the battlepass are unobtainable once the battlepass ends for a long while (months), in which they finally open up to being purchased by real money or credits.

Even combat with the special action system being shared across all units, you feel bad from wanting to use any of your new abilities because it'll ruin the fun from your friends. Even turn order being decided by the party each turn, it leads to ""no you, no you"" elements of waiting for someone else to take their turn or the other way around of fighting who goes first.

2199,370.0,,,,136754742.0,2328760,"Pinball FX is a great game that builds on previous iterations. Some of the 
biggest improvements you will notice are in the physics department and with the graphics 
and lighting. I am a seasoned digital pinball player and can tell you this is by far the closest
this game has come to having realistic physics. For me, the physics are what really sold
me on this title and I have played it since its first release on the Epic Games Store.
When you play digital pinball games, realistic physics can go a long way because 
it challenges you to make good shots and rewards you when you do but also punishes
you when you don't. In FX3, for example, the physics felt like the ball had a predetermined path
(especially on the Zen tables) which is why I played the Williams titles for the majority of my playtime.
That is not the case with Pinball FX and because of the physics overhaul, I am finding myself enjoying
titles from FX3 that I didn't have much interest in before. 
The second biggest improvement is the lighting and animations that you will notice while you are playing.
The Williams tables received a glow update that improved lighting specifically around the flashers which was
very noticeable.

If you are coming from FX3, the physics will feel a lot different at first and it will take getting used to because
it's a different engine but you will notice how much more ""realistic"" they feel the more you play.
Lastly, the amount of tables Pinball FX offers is actually quite insane. There is something for everyone. For old
timers like myself, I enjoy playing the Williams recreations the most but because of the renewed physics,
I am also enjoying original titles like Crypt of the Necrodancer a lot.

It's a bit dated in terms of gameplay and characters/twists, which is to be expected seeing as how it's about 7-10 years old now in terms of release and development, but there is genuine heart and effort put in.  It's also a story about love and expectations while also murdering monsters and helping save the kingdoms across the land.  Avoiding spoilers I remember it having a decent story although some NPCs were... annoying but that's to be expected.  The music is also a bit different than what you'd expect for a fantasy rpg but it is good, the enemies challenging enough without being cheap, and the boss designs can get very much out there but in a good/unnerving way.

Compared to other RPGs there's some QoL features like visible displays to see where hidden treasure is lying (although treasure chests can be hard to spot behind some object) and now there's an optional guide system.  Alchemic item/gear crafting is pretty straightforward and not too material demanding although some drops may be hard to come by.

Addressing many of the negative reviews (its okay to genuinely not like the game of course) which state how absurdly difficult the combat and balancing is:
The the combat plays a bit like Slay the Spire but the few battles and heavy inter/intra-battle decision making is much more akin to something like Monster Train; If you make one or two big mistakes you WILL be punished rather hard. But the opposite is also true. Big combo plays and making an almost degenerative deck can have you crushing through monsters with relative ease.

Yes the game can be brutal. Yes the leaders aren't super consistent with choice at the beginning of the run. Building a deck, deciding if you needs charms or crowns, deciding if your starter cards should be munched....these are all things to consider while looking at your cards special abilities and those of the enemy. So for all those struggling, let me give a few tips that may help you engage with the game a little better, rather than just write it off as ""bad hard game.""

1. If you can safely go for combo kills, do it. That little bit of money adds up, especially if you want to blow it all on the charm vending machine.

2. To meta progress, hit escape at find the achievements menu. Try and clear these to unlock various cards, charms and events.

3. You can and should be moving your cards around in battle as direct responses to the battle situation every single turn. With this in mind, if the battle is almost over, use this chance to recall some of your more damaged companions so they will not incur the ""injury"" debuff for next round. Also, your leader always full heals after every battle. Use this knowledge wisely to tank hits. Essentially, you want to be winning each battle as closely as possible to leader death. 

4. Save your charms until right before a battle. You may find another card later on that synergizes with the charm better. Or you may pick a card to work with a powerful charm.

5. READ. THE. DANG. CARDS. Tooltips are there for a reason. Right click on cards to see more stats so you may better plan.

6. Go slow, have fun. No need to rush, take your time and plan out moves.",1.0

2259,430.0,,,,136755971.0,1527950,"First thing I want to say is that the game isn't awful, but it isn't great currently either. My reasons are that the story isn't really a story it doesn't feel like, they seem more like side quests to which you can choose to either help one side or the other. During these ""story missions"" you can kind of just go around the map and find them at locations which to me isn't too great, the reason being you don't get much backstory into the factions I am only on second story line but so far i haven't found a faction or group i really care about. The other thing from what I can tell (not tried but seems like can do this) is you never get locked in to helping a faction so i could do all the other factions quests for one side but get to the end back-stab the group I have been helping and others will think I am a hero.

Second is that the world is vast but very limited. I have travailed around and generally speaking all I can do is craft, kill, hunt (same as killing though), steal (which seems kind of pointless), explore few dungeons or bandit camps and do quests given at towns which are generally same as stuff listed above. 

Some ideas for more to do could be that like maybe getting your own town or village or castle to which you can have mercs with their own party limit (garrison) which could maybe go out and do assignments or just store your loot and you need to improve the structure there and that could get attacked. 

Maybe like a sandbox mode where you could actually be hired by a lord or group in wars against the other territories basically like a TRPG mountain blade get own territory or help lords take more and maybe raiding. 

More dungeons for sure from what I can tell is 1 dungeon area per location.

More character interaction like randomly generated backstories or interactions beyond the 3 choice interaction already have. I have fair few members and I know none of their names they die I don't really care just off to the town for another.

That's just some ideas bit stumped at what else could be added honestly but I just feel needs to be more variety or a more engaging story.

Combat in the game is alright I have had a few lag moments at start of playing or reloading in but nothing major. Combat can be fairly tactical but it is mostly thinking who is going first seeing what roles they have and dealing with ones you hate the most. If you play adaptive mode though the one where everything scales as you do then you need to think about everything every fight is just brutal. Got a farmer with his pitchfork and rags, you got heavy armour big shield and sharp stabby sword well ... that pitchfork was forged in dragon fire baby and it going to just pierce right through. 

The other mode though where they level per area is much easier so I would play that honestly I restarted my whole campaign because the other mode was just brutal, it got to the point where I was either losing a person every fight or near death. Clearing out a strong bandit camp just seemed like was impossible because they always have equal or more troops due to reinforcement and same or higher stats.

When comes to food, money and happiness I never had a problem honestly my party currently is 2 ponies and 10 people and i haven't struggled once with any of it to give an idea i still have 10D worth of food and 1.5k Krowns. Generally all you want is money get money buy food buy salt cook food feed them pay them and they happy to murder whoever.

That's my overview I am going to play the game to completion I don't think the game is like the worst thing to ever be made but it does feel like it drags on and is limited to what you can do I think it can become something really good it just needs more stuff to do, more engagement and fleshed out lore and backstories of places and people and a better story really but that could be too late to work on now so perhaps the other areas.

2263,434.0,,,,136757491.0,2328760,"First off, let me start by saying that I adored zen releases in the past, (mainly fx3, the deals they offered on bundles, ease of use and incredibly smooth gameplay) and ended up buying 99/100 tables, though I know there are more from lost licenses I was very pleased with the amount I spent. I never found Indiana Jones to be worth 3x the other tables, so I didnt purchase it. Then we get the announcement that a new, remastered game was coming in hot from Zen studios named Pinball FX that would be exclusive to Epic games for exactly 1 year. Here is where things started to go sour, with no option to move any tables or receive any vouchers from Zen to make the transition seamless. While I understood this gesture, I didnt understand why that also came with an awful version of the game, on Epic. Nearly unplayable. I accepted this and simply moved back to fx3, which I did not mind as I already had quite the collection of games to keep me busy.  Moving forward 1 year, we get the Steam release and to my incredible surprise, the game plays quite flawlessly albeit missing a native resolution (3840x1080, which worked flawlessly in fx3. 2560x1080 is the resolution I use in the meantime, which gives pretty significant black bars on both sides of the screen, and a slight downgrade on the resolution that shows a bit of jaggedness, no matter, the game still plays great). The game also now comes with an integrated orientation swapping setting, which is awesome and actually works on my screen, nearly looks like a full size pinball machine. So after exhausting my 1 day of free pinball pass, which is also a nice gesture, I looked to see if there were any options to swap my fx3 tables to no avail. Again, new engine, physics, graphics, which are all great, so I really dont mind paying for the tables I dont own on fx3 already,  HOWEVER, while this new version of the game is an incredibly well done version of what we have come to love over the years in fx3, I feel like it is pretty scummy to expect any sort of payment for tables that people own on your ""abandoned"" platform, fx3, in your new game, pinball FX. The people who would end up continuing to support your game into the future, are the same ones you are looking right in the eye and saying ""pay again"". No thanks. Great game, great remaster, awesome tables, scummy, SCUMMY tactics. I wont be recommending this game to anyone until they find a way to shake the hand of those who have supported their previous iterations for so long.

You start of in a level select, weird with no introduction, but alright. I hit new game and got brought instantly in the game, graphics are fine but have this weird effect on them.
It felt pretty good moving around, most objects could be picked up and there was text showing me exactly what to do, or at least trying to tell me. The text showing where the eviction notice was was fine for the first level or two, but after that i felt it was fairly annoying seeing all the time. There could have been an option for it, but as said earlier, the graphics had a weird effect on them, and text was hard to read.

It was alright going through at first, but there was little to no variation, go and pick up the poem (optional) and then throw the eviction notice off. It quickly became bland and boring, as the map was only changing a bit.

The audio was meh at best. ""with stunning visuals and lifelike sound effects that fully immerse the players in the experience."" The only audio that i vividly remember is the music that just cuts off if you're in a level for too long. No variation in the audio either. Not even a sound effect for picking up a poem or throwing the eviction notice off.

The graphics as told earlier had a weird effect, but were fine. Immersive enough, but not better than anything like Boneworks, Pavlov or H3VR. Looking down though, you see a very undetailed ""map"" of the construction people? If you fall down, then it renders with better quality, but you're not falling down all the time.

Controls were fine, grabbing onto most things is more than a few games can say. I was confused though when grabbing the handle of a drawer grabbed the entire drawer. You grab onto the entire model instead of just bits of it, which was unfortunate and sad. Also wish they had more things, triggers didn't even do anything other than just twitch the index finger.

There was a bug apparent too, hands getting stuck in things was not fun. You just get stuck there and have to twitch yourself a lot to fix it. Also, in a level, you started just by falling to the bottom of a container. I'm usually fine to falling, but not when its unexpected, nothing from stopping me from playing, but pretty bad for others if they can't expect it.

Those were my main gripes about the game, but why include achievements if you're only going to have one that's given from starting up the game?

I think this type of movement could be better utilised in a climbing game, or something of the sort. I would be more fine with most of these things if it was free, because free things don't usually expect quality, but having to pay, even if it's a low price is setting the standard higher.

Био-прототип - это клон vampire survivors (на самом деле, бротато, но пофиг), где все способности и предметы сделаны в виде внутренних органов, которые отращивает наш мутант.

Органы делятся на две группы, ""рабочие"", которые что-то делают, и ""соединительные"", которые выступают в качестве перемычек между рабочими и активируют орган при определенном условии.  Еще органы бывают разных типов - например, щупальца стреляют, конечности наносят урон в ближнем бою, детеныши плодятся, позвоночник активирует следующий за ним орган, а глаз - активирует следующий орган, если предыдущий нанес урон противнику. Из этого всего, как из конструктора, нужно собирать организм своего мутанта, причем органы лепятся друг к другу не просто так, а по определенным правилам.

В качестве корня выступает мозг, к нему можно приделать, например, позвоночник, который будет что-то активировать раз в несколько секунд. Добавим щупальце - будем стрелять пульками. Прилепим к щупальцу нерв, а к нерву коготь - и каждая пулька при попадании будет бить когтем вокруг себя.
Можно сделать хитрее: к позвоночнику приделаем детенышей, детенышам дадим кишечник и мешочек с ядом - и теперь они будут создавать лужи ядовитой жидкости. А во второй слот поставим им еще один позвоночник, к нему щупальце стреляющее по спирали, на щупальце повесим глаз, а к глазу - паутинную железу, которая выпускает паутинку в детеныша и наносит урон всем кто с ней столкнется - теперь каждый детеныш будет выпускать по несколько пулек, которые будут летать по спирали и резать паутиной всех, кто окажется между ними и детенышем.

Сначала эти крылья, ноги и хвосты вызывают головную боль, но стоит лишь немного разобраться - и из очередного  horde survival игра превращается в развлечение ""собери мутанта с самыми безумными механиками"".

2305,476.0,,,,136761840.0,1811990,"I have beaten the game once and here are my thoughts.

Now first off is Wildfrost a good game?

Very. It is quite fun and really makes you think.

Is the balance flawed?

Very.

Some builds simply do not work and in most instances even if you are going for a build that can work you are reliant on specific units (in my case spice flag and the weaken damage charm I likely could have won without any of the other buffs on Mika but without being able to increase her combo reliably and maintain spice I would have had no win condition viable with what was given to me.) Often you just do not get the pieces you need to make a build work. For example say you get a unit in the shadow tribe that doubles afterburn.

Cool I'll do an afterburn build.

Sometimes you won't get any afterburn applying cards.

2 x 0 = 0

This happens a lot in this game, and there is little means to manage it.

You can win and skill is important there are no per say FREE wins here but sometimes if the game isn't giving you the pieces you need you just kinda lose.

You may think you can reroll or skip cards.

None of that no you get 3 good luck fucker.

There aren't even many chances to take cards in the first place, you get around 6 before the first boss and if you don't have a good basis for your build by the time ya reach the area after that boss you are unlikley to survive.

There are also times the game can feel overwhelming with like up to 10 counters on screen and units to move around. It can often feel like a bunch of spinning plates even with a decent playable build.

In other games you can make a couple mistakes and still one, but in Wildfrost one missed position or one forgotten enemy who attacked one turn sooner than you planned for is a run ender.

The game is more overwhelming and has less wiggle room than anything else.

This isn't without pros it really makes you think which is great but it can be frustrating.

Not to hammer home the comparison but if I misplay once in Slay The Spire I can still recover, there is risk reward and one bad roll on that risk or one unblocked attack is not the end of a run granted it does punish you.

Here that one misplay does end a run and this can be frustrating especially when you simply didn't get the combo pieces you needed.

Some builds I feel are underpowered are sacrifice builds for the shadow tribe and shell/healing builds.

For sacrifice builds you need multiple specific card or a main hero that can summon (which btw heroes are rng so good luck with that) otherwise it doesn't work even when t does it ramps up far to slowly to be useful often needing 2 cards played to do one thing even with some decent synergies.

Healing and shell aka armor don't work cause means to apply healing or armor are to slow and in a game where enemies can in some cases one hit you they are not very helpful.

There are cases they can work but the scaling on them is VERY slow and dependent on getting very particular cards, in addition most healing cards have low max hp so one would assume that you could mix the two to cover that but most shield applying cards deal damage or lower your max hp so that's some pretty hard anti synergy.

How am I gonna use a healer with 4 max hp when most enemies have 6+ attack?

And they heal two?

See above point.

The real issue in my opinion is how punishing the game is compared to others and how dependent you can be on card rng in particular when you have so few chances to try to get other cards every draw really counts.",1.0

Difficulty: This is most people's main gripe but if you love a challenge with rogue like deckbuilders, then Wildfrost is excellent. It is harder to begin with than Monster Train or Slay the Spire but this difficulty eases up as you unlock more features. Sadly the features take a while to unlock, but are very easy unlocks that encourage you to try out all styles of play in the game. Once you beat the game (and the first difficulty was easily beatable in 5 or so hours) you can add modifiers to increase the difficulty. Personally, I cannot stand rogue likes that are too easy and make you grind through countless ascension levels just to become a challenge. For me, Wildfrost hit the balance of challenge right, otherwise it simply would not be a good game if you won every time.

Graphic and Design: Impeccable, succinct and streamlined.

Balance: This could do with some shakeups as certain playstyles  do feel imbalanced and easier to get results with. However, the game is well balanced with a ton of variety in enemies.

I highly recommend this to any deckbuilder veterans.

2309,480.0,,,,136761121.0,1811990,"Writing a review because of the numerous unjustified negative reviews around.

Wildfrost is a well executed roguelike deckbuilder with an engaging gameplay loop, clean and cute designs, interesting core mechanics, and a variety of valid strategies. As many others have already stated, the game is difficult but definitely not unbeatable or (imo) unbalanced. The game requires careful consideration and planning during battles which might mean taking a few minutes per turn every now and again. From my personal experience, most of my runs have ended owing to faulty decision on my end rather than unbeatable enemy encounters. It is not only vital to collect cards that synergize but also to have answers for various enemy types and situations in your deck.

2312,483.0,,,,136762192.0,307950,"After having played for 23 hours and getting a good grip with the game I can recomend it. The game is fun, the gunplay is good, not the best I've seen but still good and for a change it actually has PVE modes (imagine a game that does that in 2023, it's almost as if the developers wanted the game to have success). I played  the PVP and PVEVP to try once for the rewards but honestly I'm not a fan of anything with PVP, however it seemed just fine though take my opinion on the PVP content with a grain of salt.

The buisness model seems fairish. The prices are a bit high for cosmetics in my opinion but it seems fine otherwise. It's is playable free and I really don't believe that buying anything is required at all. You can gain XP faster if you have premium but because your money will not progress anywhere nearly as fast as your XP, grinding the money is the real deal and therefore you don't even need premium. Something could be said about being able to spend real money for the in game money trade which reminds me of the aweful rates of WoT and such (this game used to be tied to wargamming not sure if it still is) but overall it seems alright.

The negatives points from my perspective are in the customisation. Characters are gender locked and though other skins exist they are always the same gender. This is a big let down for me and since the gender makes no different in the gameplay, it would be better to allow everyone to play whatever gender they want, even if through a skin. If they lowered the prices but made many skins of different genders it could easily become a good revenue source.

Another thing that you can't customise is your loadout. You can swap your cosumables to some minor degree and chose whether or not to add the fixed upgrades you unlock for your guns. You don't get to chose what scopes you have and what silencers you have and different mag types and so on. I believe this will let down a lot of players and though it would change the gameplay a bit, especially with the mags I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to balance. Another let down is how all scopes are fixed zoom (at least I haven't seen them being able to zoom in and out but I could have missed it).

All in all, it's still a fun game and it's free so give it a try, it won't cost you anything.",1.0

A controller works well, and there is no tutorial. I did find a fellow deer, but this deer was floating backwards. I believe the goal of the maps was to move towards a yellow mineral which moved me to a different map with other blips on the map. Walking through trees is possible, and I saw no collision detection. The deer I was controlling had very strange colours, and the deer had a slight animation problems when it was running up or down hills. I would have preferred a more natural looking deer. The most off putting thing is when walking up or down a hill and the immobile camera showed the underside of the hill. The sky coloured bottom below my deer and short line of land separating my deer from falling forever wasn't relaxing to see. My deer didn't fall through the land though, so big plus.

My vote could go either way on Pinball FX at the present moment.  My own *personal* experience would lean toward a highly-qualified ""recommended"", but only because I have a rather powerful gaming PC and an HDR display that can do this title justice.  I have an 11th gen i7 processor and a RTX 3070Ti GPU with a 144hz Gsync 1440p HDR display... which is upper mid-tier hardware atm.  I can run Pinball FX with Raytracing and HDR enabled in Portrait/TATE mode at @100-120 fps.... at 70% display scaling (1080p effectively).  This isn't as bad as it sounds, because it would seem that display scaling doesn't not affect rendered element in a linear fashion.  The playfield texture resolution, for example, seems to maintain 100% (or close) resolution even at 70% scaling, so it's really only the 3D ramps/rails and raytracing elements that seem to lose definition with the reduced scaling.

The point is - expect that you'll need to compromise on some settings if you have anything less than an RTX 4090 gpu.  To my mind, 60fps is simply not good enough for natural-feeling pinball.  You will probably have to turn down some settings to hit a smooth, flowing, responsive FPS.  I find that it needs at least a more-or-less consistent 90 FPS before it starts looking/feeling good.  120 FPS or higher is buttery smooth.  And of course, you need to have Vsync disabled, or you will feel the input lag.  Which also means that your display will require variable refresh rate  (VRR/GSync/FreeSync) or you will experience tearing.  Some of this is not Pinball FX's fault, to be fair.

This new Pinball FX has exactly 2 things going for it, as compared to the previous Pinball FX3: raytraced lighting and HDR support.  The updated physics are... fine... but I thought they were fine before.  If your PC hardware doesn't have some serious heft to it in order to push raytracing and HDR... well, then... you might as well stick to FX3 imo.

But, with raytracing and HDR enabled.... wow.  I mean, it really is quite visually stunning!  Being able to play my two favourite IRL tables of all time in Pinball FX (Twilight Zone and The Addams Family), in portrait mode, with raytracing and HDR enabled.  That's the stuff of my dreams - it's really, really excellent.  I would massively recommend THAT experience.  But you won't get THAT experience unless you come packing a behemoth of a dedicated PC gaming rig, and that's the main reason I can't give a thumbs-up right now.

Pinball FX doesn't currently support AMD FSR 2.0 (or higher - 3.0 is releasing soon) and it doesn't support DLSS.  So, enabling raytracing on support hardware will cut your FPS *BY HALF* -seriously!  It feels like a lot more people could enjoy these tables the way they're meant to be enjoyed if this software were to support current upscaling technologies.  Also, Pinball FX claims to finally support custom camera settings for each table.  That's only slightly true.  The settings are incredibly limited to just a few broad camera tilt adjustments at the moment.  That's not proper custom camera support.  Pinball FX claims to have cabinet settings for a separate backglass and DMD positioning.  But if you enable it, the application drops from fullscreen into borderless windowed mode, meaning you're stuck with Windows always-enabled Vsync (input lag!) and a 60 FPS cap.  Lame!

There's a lot of potential here for the developers to implement performance-saving image upscaling methods, more granular display settings, proper custom camera settings, and more.  If they do, then I will change my review and give my full heartfelt recommendation.  But, as it stands today, proceed with caution.  There is some absolutely awesome pinball available in here - but have you got the rig and the display to access it?",0.0

There's two questions to ask/answer when looking at this purchase:

1: Is this collection worth the price tag? 
Answer: Yes;

as someone who's played and owned all the old cartridges back in the day, let me say this release has been a bit of a dream come true. 

QoL changes, AI upscale filter for my old eyes, everything I know and love is in here + extra.

If you do the math the way I did at $60 USD, each game, including the alternate versions (3 White/Blue, 4RedSun/BlueMoon, 5Proto/Colonel, 6Gregar/Falzar) you absolutely SHOULD play both versions as they contain entirely separate characters in the story that you'll face off against. so to get the entire Battle Network 3 experience you'll need to play both Blue and White, etc. 

based on this alone I already justified the purchase as a steal at $6 per game, with working Online Multiplayer functions. They imported that Japanese exclusive Battle Chips that were only given away during promotions and the only way to get them in America was to use a GameShark or ActionReplay

_________________

2: Is this a good game/franchise to get into

oh my god, yeah, this is really good shit. 10/10.
an action RPG, with card battler elements, and fast-paced battles with a strategic 3x3 grid layout. 

The combat is the coolest and hardest thing to describe and it's only after you mess around with the intricate systems and start virus busting and building out your chip library and finding cool Program Advances that you really get a feel for it and it becomes so rewarding and enjoyable. 

if any part of you is even considering playing this or is a little bit curious; definitely check it out. These games are so near and dear to me and they will always have a special place in my heart. 

There is a sense of charm from the pixel style graphics, but it almost lends itself full circle back to an indie game scene that is has since inspired.

Tray Racers is a really fun procedurally generated party racing game. There are currently 2 game modes (not sure if there will be more in the future): time trials and racing lobbies. Up to 16 people can race in a lobby, and because the tracks are randomized, it always feels like you have a chance at winning since it's not like anyone gets the advantage of practicing before you. The way the races work is you get 5 minutes of practice all together and then one final race. The winners are determined by both the practice trial times and the final race time.

I played this game on stream as well and had chat members join in for races, and it was extremely fun and everyone had a great time. Tray Racers oozes charm and the surprise of ""what comes next"" with each race keeps everyone's attention.

If you like racing games or want to try something new, definitely check this out. It's free, so why not? (PS: It is also available on Nintendo Switch!)",1.0

My thoughts so far on the game:

The Good:
- The gunplay is amazing! No weapon is too strong or too weak.
- Movement is also a solid plus. Can be a bit clunky at times, but gets better with practice.
- Operators in game have stats and abilities that are unique to them, loadout options are pretty flexible.
- No Astrophysics PhD required!

The Bad:
- No region locked servers, so it's practically guaranteed that you'll encounter players above 300 ping.
- Uses ACE anti-cheat, which can be a red flag for some people.
- Operator abilities have 0 description on how they work, so you're basically forced to figure it out for yourself.
- Some maps are small, other maps are way too large. Some maps are predominantly indoors, other maps demand fighting out in the open.
- An in-game currency (obtained as a reward for leveling up) which, at the time of writing this review, has no use whatsoever.

Once again, I do recommend this game, just not for the time being. Definitely keep it on your radar.",0.0

2407,578.0,,,,136765134.0,2367980,"[i]The Witch, Wife, & the Wish[/i] is a very short single-read novel without any choices that will take less than 30 minutes to read from start to finish.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Westley is a married man whose wife is lost to him.  She is suffering from a malady which means she cannot remember him.  So he leaves his village to visit a witch in a nearby enchanted forest; a witch who “sells” wish fulfilment in order to make a living.

He asks her to cure his wife so that they can live happily together again.  What transpires is a very bittersweet narrative which builds the relationship between customer (Westley) and supplier (Charlotte, the witch) before revealing the truth – which, in itself, is very easy to pre-empt just by absorbing the initial exchanges.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
Despite its extreme brevity, by keeping it very simple and focusing on only the two main players (although a 3rd person does appear briefly) and the one story thread, the writer successfully creates a false depth which makes the leads endearing and has the reader supporting them.

For a free game, both graphics and sound are fine.  Graphically simple, with a slight blur on the background which fits the atmosphere.

The English isn't [i]quite[/i] perfect, but it's close enough to not matter.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
For me, the game opened in a small window covering about one quarter of the screen.  I found that odd.

There's no “back” button, although there is a good log.

The text speed is preset, so sometimes you're waiting for it to finish before reading or moving on, as it is not instant.

At the end of the story, it simply says “The End”, and you have to X in the top corner to close it.

It is literally so short that the story itself remains unresolved.  I'd add that this is as opposed to unfinished, it's clearly meant to be left “open”, but as the writer successfully makes one care about the characters, it's a pity that there isn't a properly satisfactory conclusion.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
It's nice, sweet, and for less than the time it takes to wait while dinner cooks, it fills time pleasantly when you have a little gap that isn't long enough to do anything else.  It's definitely worth a visit, it won't cost you anything except a few minutes that you probably wouldn't use more constructively anyway if you found the opportunity to look in the first place.

Quite an easy recommendation, this one.

Negative review = Skill issue",1.0
2416,587.0,,,,136769095.0,1811990,"The negative reviews for this game are extremely misleading but common issues are understandable here. However: it's entirely unfair to negative-review bomb a game to this degree. When I want somethings' reputation to suffer, it's because the product is failing to function as a game: crashing, undeveloped, you know, it feels like crap and plays like crap

This game runs clean, all content is extremely well implemented and balanced, and the charming atmosphere is polished to a standard that most game studios never achieve. This game is well-loved and well worth the price, especially the soundtrack. There are many effective deck-strategies that are as fun as they are different from another. What I'm trying to say is, the reviews requesting balance changes appear to be from a misguided consensus conversation happening elsewhere, probably on a reddit, because it's not reflected here in the game.

The reasons for the disconnect between players and the games current state are better explained by the two problems that are confusing players. 

1. Many mechanics are simply not clearly explained, leaving the player surprised at the results of some actions listed on the cards. This is a serious issue, I've had entire runs ruined by a single turn and it was frustrating to learn 'the hard way' how something works. This problem can be fixed easily and the developer will likely straighten the verbiage out soon. Keep in mind that smaller game studios will have these issues without a AAA QA team, Not worth a negative review though.

2. There is a steep learning curve using aforementioned unclear mechanics. This problem becomes far less punishing after you've unlocked most of the content after several runs. I've won multiple times now but only after many losses. This is also a serious problem and likely why players are bouncing off the game. Expect your first runs to be losses . My recommendation would be for the developer to create a shorter adventure track that earns double rewards until you unlock the second tribe, just to give newer players a fair shot at beating the entire gameloop before they hit the grind.

Despite those problems, this game is immensely satisfying and rewards clever planning and synergizing
I hope this review can persuade you that this is a diamond of a deckbuilder currently buried beneath a pile of snow. The reviews telling you it's an unbalanced mess, i.e 'the game is doomed because the foundation of balance is crap from the beginning', are totally inaccurate. If you're a Slay The Spire fan and want something new, this game is it.

The randomized leaders are my biggest gripe. Due to being given one of each faction and their initial strength being a major impact on the success of the first round, some randomized leaders feel too weak to be worth playing whilst others feel a waste to miss out on. Due to that, instead of playing the style I feel like, I feel that I'm constantly pushed to either switch styles every run or reset until I get a decent leader (which takes a lot of steps for something the equivalent of a reroll button) This is especially frustrating when trying to unlock everything or hunt achievements.",0.0

Pros-Nice visuals, neat sci-fi premise, decent soundtrack.

Cons-The narrative aspect is at odds with the gameplay.  If you make a mistake and have to restart a ""thread"" (redo the ""amendment"" of a civilization) you'll have to see the long, slow blocks of text (even on max speed the text feels like it is pouring through molasses) again and there's really not much to do during these chunks aside from waiting for the next prompt you can click.

After Zen haven't fixed previous tables on FX3 and I suspect the ported tables will still have the same bugs, albeit have more chance of being fixed in this new version, I cannot help but feel that Zen have simply taken the money for all the FX3 tables, abandoned everyone who's got issues with either the FX3 software or some of the tables and instead, decided to create another system and see how much money they can get out of people for that.

I'm sure synergies and optimal strategies will emerge over time as I gain experience, but just know that it's not watered down. 

The primary difference to XCOM-style engagements is that the ultimate goal is escape, not victory. The more loot and remaining HP you escape with, the better. But the game often forces you to prioritize HP, loot, or XP over each other with no neat answers. It also runs on autosaves, which disallows save-scumming and really ratchets up the tension.

1. The game is ~35 minutes long.
2. Levels are very repetitive, with only a handful notable things happening.
3. Melee, sniper, kamikaze, just three enemies, all roughly at same health, no particular strategies about them. Some vehicular bosses but no helicopters to shoot or whatever.
4. [b]You don't need to kill anything[/b].  Far too many enemies constantly spawning anyway. Just dash forward with the hook to skip to next level, killing enemies is pointless. It's consistently easy to out-regenerate them on Normal.
5. All guns feel the same. You can kick people with your foot, or don't. You can also kill them with the hook I guess. Doesn't matter. No depth to combat whatsoever.
6. Physics have this wonky Unity feel to them. Some objects are surprisingly not solid at all (especially on the final level, but all destroyed vehicles are also super wonky).
7. Technical issues (game freezing at loading screens, not preserving the selected language, framerate issues on one level). They'll probably get fixed but they aren't now.

I was excited because this looks cool but that's about it. It looks cool. As an actual videogame it's just half hour worth of ignoring enemies to hook forward through slightly janky physics. I don't know what I expected but it didn't do it for me at all.",0.0

overall for the game, however, is very bright in its potential. i see this game as having a very promising future in its release, but as for the prologue, it's very rusty and confusing. the tutorial isn't the most help in the process, and you oftentimes have to figure out things on your own.

so to conclude, is this game good and flexible? not very much, but it has lots of room for improvement and plenty of time to fix itself. just currently, it feels like a lower-quality type of simulator game that has to do with building things, partially due to the non-realistic aspects of some steps taken during assembly. the full game without a doubt is going to be better than this unless the developer(s) don't make any changes to the process of each order in the game.",0.0

Would be cool to see new gadgets in the future. I also think that manual reloading should be a thing, make it an option or outright the way to reload. Adding animation to make it to where people can't spam the reload to quickly similar to pavlov could be a great way of implementing this. I feel reloading is a core experience to a vr shooter. I also think weapon skins and character skins would be cool to add in the future for completing milestones. The game is already $30 so I think paying for cosmetics could be hit or miss, if paid ones are in the game I think some should be added to be earned from milestones (challenges) Of course new maps in the future should be added, but the 3 we have now are fun so far. You should be able to hold items in your hands so when the new round starts you can hand things to your teammates, you survived the round you should keep all items.

One of the things I loved most about Unscripted is the way the game allows the player to make choices that have a real impact on the story, I am mostly talking about the River path. There are a few choices I haven't expected to go that way, so I had to Save before, and check them on later.

I am not an avid player of visual novels, but after playing Unscripted I might check out more of the genre-a, especially if there are some more in this mainstream kind of vibe. This really felt like I was playing through a TV show. I am very much looking forward to the rest of the season.",1.0

So far, there is a lot that I really like about the game, but one major thing that has impacted my enjoyment. I have pretty sensitive eyes and can get eye strain easily. The issue is this: the camera sensitivity in the game is TOO TOO sensitive, which means it's very easy to get eye fatigue, feel nauseated, etc. I literally turned my camera sensitivity to zero and turned off head bob and could only manage two hours of gameplay before I had too bad of a headache to continue.

2476,647.0,,,,136771988.0,1811990,"The visuals are fantastic and the game involves lots of tactical opportunities. Most mistakes feel very punishing and hard to recover from which makes you focus on most decisions.
There seems to be tons of varieties to be had with the different factions and tons of different main characters randomized for each run. Some of these options are very easy to master but some way way way less so.

Unfortunately like many people say there are some balance issues and some runs are guaranteed lost early cause there was nothing else that you could do provided with what the run got you.
While this is a factor in other roguelites like Slay the Spire that many people compare it to, it isn't nearly as prevalent there as it is in this game.

When it comes to locations that you visit during your run, it feels like that is one of the games greatest shortcomings.
Because the power level that they provide to the team is also very drastic.
You pretty much always want to upgrade your cards, if that location isn't available then you want to get money so that you potentially can get a shop so that you can upgrade your cards even more. 
But there are some terrible upgrades in the sense that they are extremely situational like reducing the attack of your cards and giving a special type of hp that only can be applied to certain creatures.
Getting good upgrades feel essential for a good run cause some of the upgrades are really awesome
Some locations are unlocked later in the game that gives you some options, but from my experience upgrades are key.

Even after all these negative aspects, I'm still enjoying myself. Combat feels like a puzzle because you don't want your allies to die because then the next fight will be harder and you don't want your main character to tank too much and die because then the run is over. When it all looks over and you realize that you can survive one turn more and it just snowballs into a win is one of the best feelings to have in this game,
You move around your team constantly to get the best types of attack and defense, it just works so well!

If you get this game, try to go in with an open mind and don’t expect to get a win or go very far. There is some rng that can feel devastating, like the enemy having a single minion that can wipe your entire team cause you had no way to play around it or even worse that the enemy makes 3 random attacks and your main character goes from full hp to zero resulting in a loss. But in the end all you can do is try again until it works.

This game definitely doesn't deserve to have Mixed reviews cause it can be so much fun and it has tons of potential.

2486,657.0,,,,136770464.0,307950,"Caliber is a third person shooter with abilities and gadgets feeling mostly unique across the 64 operators available in the game. I have been playing this game for exactly 1 year since April 2022 and in that time, I have seen the game shaped for the better. The developers have been very receptive to the community feedback and are constantly improving on the game. There have been numerous changes to the economy, operators, matchmaking, and finally the inclusion of NA, SA, LATM, and EU servers on steam.

PROS:
•	The game is free to play and costs nothing for the user to get into the game. Players have a complete range of content to choose from for all game modes and over 60 operators.
•	Operators can be leveled up for 15 levels and have a nonlinear trait progression where you can select a trait/passive for each level as you progress.
•	There are four different roles to choose from and the PVP matchmaking allows you to select any number of 16 operators for each of the roles. 
•	There are skills that can be unlocked and selected from each operator. You can select the 4 different skills to run on your operator as additional passives. The skills can be changed on the fly before the start of your game, just after the operator selection phase. This allows you to choose a set of skills based on the map or enemy operator choices making the game feel dynamic with a depth of options to choose from.
•	There are executions and emotes that are top notch. You can pick up your enemy and slap them in the face to finish off/execute them. I'm adding this in here because it truly is one of the best things that I've ever seen in any video game. It must be the most disrespectful way to execute someone.
•	Reserves cost nothing and you are given them free at the start of every game.
•	There is no lean peeking in the game which lends itself to a more effective TTK.
•	TTK is in a great place for the majority of the operators.
•	This is a TPS which involves a lot of gun skill. It is easy to get into and play as a new player of TPS games.
•	Games are only 5-10 minutes long with 2- or 3-minute rounds and first to 3. This means the games are over and done quickly. It’s easy to pick up and put back down again.
•	Developers are open to feedback and are working tirelessly to produce all of the changes that were requested over the last year.

CONS:
•	The games sometimes feel too short leaving me wanting a bit more. I would consider adding more rounds to the game modes to give a bit more time in a match.
•	Some of the operators (especially medics) can feel hopeless when you match up against very tanky supports. I’ve heard some criticism about a few specific operators feeling like they’re shooting marshmallows. The problem with this is buyers’ remorse and players not being happy with their selection of operator. This happens in every game and can be difficult for players to get over. 
•	With a game having 60 operators, there are balancing issues because it’s very hard to balance 60 operators equally without a couple feeling unfair. Currently there are about 15 or so operators that stand out among the pack and have become the “go to” operators for the game. I would like to see other operators that are weaker get buffs to bring them closer in line with the best operators.
•	The BattlePass is not available at certain times. The BattlePass should always be available and give players the option to buy those operators. Additionally, these operators should be able to be purchased for a larger number of credits which should be reduced to a normal amount of credits when the next BattlePass comes out.
•	The amount of time it takes to get an operator to level 15 can feel a bit overwhelming and grindy. But I would like to point out that you do not need to get every character to level 15 when there are only 15 or so that are considered the top of the pack. This reduces the grind considerably. I would like to see the amount of credits that players earn increase a little bit.

Conclusion:
I know that a lot of players would say this game is pay-to-win and that was (past tense) previously the case before they did the economy rework. I think that the changes that they have made over the last year have really moved the game into a great place where players can get anything in the game as long as they spend the time playing it. With the new Daily and Weekly objective system and all the new player exclusive benefits, players can earn their first few operators very quickly. Additionally, for those completionist who want every operator unlocked, there is always something to grind for. The game’s hit registration feels very crisp, and gunplay is the most important aspect in this game. The 60 different skills, 15 different traits, 4 different reserves, and 60 different operators give the game a depth that will pique your interest and constantly keep the game fresh. As someone who normally doesn’t like TPS games, this TPS game is at the top of the list and will easily become a main stay.",1.0

Be wary: THERE IS NO REAL COOP IN THIS GAME, it was added with the same idea in mind - ""lets add something that are not fun and doesn't work just because Battle Brothers don't have that"".

There is a beautiful 3D world. Where nothing is randomized, so replayability is very low.
There is plot. With quests where you ""sorta"" have a choice, but in reality you don't, as decisions are forced on you, and it won't affect anything storywise anyway after you do 4 quests in a region.
There is crafting with clicking minigames. That's okay, but i'm really bored clicking on circles for 100th time. And you can craft gear with only the most basic abilities, which you don't want to use, believe me.
Combat is fun for the first 10 hours, then it became sleep fest as the damage doesn't scale too much, ""fast"" combat animation isn't really fast, and it took forever to finish a turn with 8+ companions. There are no zones of control and no 
matter how thick your frontline is, AI will sneak though it, so no chokepoints for you except rare cases of map generation. Also, fire is very !FUN! mechanic (no).
Arenas are pure cancer. Wanted and suspicion mechanics are annoying and is not fun. Trading is nonexistent. Regions are alike. Scaling is unfair - I guess that won't be an issue if I play on regional difficulty, but I won't start the game from the beginning, as there is literally no replay value and I will make the exact same things for 17 hours.

Good. . . ish is probably the best way to describe my experience with Hunt the Night. On the surface it has a lot of things working for it that, in theory are fun, but it doesn't quite seem to know what do do with those mechanics. This game is sort of a shotgun scatter of different ideas that are loaded into it but never really seem to reach their true potential. 

The combat is sufficient, but the enemies don't really telegraph their moves so much as you learn the patterns and then just get the timing down. Enemies who shoot projectiles are almost easier to deal with than anything with a melee moveset. 

The exploration is fine, but the lack of a map means that a lot of the areas sort of just blend together and it's hard to get a sense of where you are at times. 

Power progression is strange in this game. It doesn't really exist. The weapons don't feel like they do enough to differentiate themselves from one another, the spells feel generally lacking, and the most direct upgrades are all to tertiary systems. Health is tied to optional hunts, finding sanguine altars, and your gear. It feels strange to have 3 direct ways of influencing your maximum health. It might have felt better if the altars increased your base strength or did something else other than just increase your max health because the optional hunts already do that too. Stats are all sort of okay. Hemostasis causes your attacks to heal you and Plagus is just a poison DoT. Those are the only two, and Hemostatis is objectively better because of the limited healing resources. 

Overall this game feels like a bite-sized version of a more full experience, and that has nothing to do with the actual length of the game. It's moreso that there's less nuance with the subsystems in the game than I expected. The campaign of the game is there, but the rest of it is still stuck in an early access stage. Some things should have been left out, while others should have been expanded. The traversal with Umbra is one of those things. It just doesn't feel fun, and it breaks the pacing of the exploration too much.

The music and art are good. There's clearly a lot of passion put into the lore and world overall. The gameplay just leans into being  good enough, and so the game winds up feeling 'good-ish'. 

A very light recommendation from me. I think it's price point saves it in this regard.",1.0

I contacted them in email, (no reply) but in discord they responded and said its been an issue they're aware of and that they will work on it asap since they were gathering as much info as possible. I worked with them, sent them copies of my dxdiag. Tried some things they suggested. So i left the demo on a positive note, thinking it'll be bugfixed before release.

However,
I recently bought it, and copies as gifts for friends.
Sadly, I thought the issue was addressed. It was not.
Same issue. Crashing around the 20 minute mark.

2520,691.0,,,,136770471.0,1968710,"The last game to get me as wired while playing it was ULTRAKILL, and that's for good reason, because MEATGRINDER is as insanely fast-paced and chaotic as it says on the box, with an awesome soundtrack to boot! It is so fast-paced I would wager most people start and finish this game in one sitting. This is very possible because the game's campaign, as it were, only takes about 40 minutes to complete (I took 45, though I died a few times). There is also an infinite mode though, which is a good addition that adds to replayability.

At this price point for me its a biiit lean for my liking and in spite of how much I enjoyed the time I had with the game, I initially considered refunding it since I had thought this was all we were going to get until a MEATGRINDER 2 due the lack of an Early Access tag. Thankfully however, I saw I had made a mistake, because the devs have said in a Discussions post that they are actively working on new levels and achievements to add in the near future. I hope the game gets fleshed out significantly more in subsequent updates because I can't wait to return to grind more MEAT!!!

1. Unlocking weapons is too difficult, I don't even know how to other then a basic idea of killing a boss with a weapon and getting that weapon afterwards.
2. The zombies (And ESPECIALLY bosses) are relentless, and sometimes during blood moons they will just KNOW where you are. Keep in mind I've gone out of my way to avoid this by closing all the doors of the house i'm in, sitting in a room with no windows relatively in the center of the house, and they still find you.
Bosses have it much worse, they will follow you and follow you for eternity, even if you die or suicide.
3. The bosses are WAAAY to difficult. I just quit the game during the Riot Boss fight during the second phase. It literally has a gun and even 150 damage is barely even a few pixels of his HP bar.
4. Literally every single Rifle is underpowered, even the RAREST rifles. This normally wouldn't be too much of a problem in an Open Alpha, but the rarity of rifles combined with the fact that most use Sniper Ammo, the most RARE ammo, makes it a huge issue.
Honestly, even though I basically just wrote an essay on why I wouldn't recommend this game, it has a lot of potential. I especially like the idea of it being a wave defense game. It just needs love and time.",0.0

Although there's some UX issues I've stumbled upon I expect them to be fixed and the whole game to be improved upon in the future, even though the team who created the game is small, I will be more than happy to support this game and excitingly wait for future updates.

As of this review i have 11 hours into this game and almost all unlocks in town and have beaten the game once but as stated some issues i do want to point out to hope they get adjusted or fixed out right that will make this game better to new comers and over all. I will also state the reason for each negative and leave spoilers out of the review till the end to be clear.

Pros
- Mechanics: out of all the deck builder's and roguelikes i have played it stands out and is fun most times.

- Keywords: All are great and add fun aspects to them except for two of them explained later.

- Clans: Cool and distinct to one another.

- End game: Mechanic on how it plays the first time and home it gets harder is super cool and unique.

- Events/Pathing: Simple and impactful.

- Enemies/encounter: Fun and cool that they are themed.

-Sound: The game sounds great to play with and relax.

-The inventors Hut: feels great to unlock and start using.
Negatives
- Keywords: 
          - Aimless: is fine for the player to use but as for the enemy it feels unfair from as low as sometimes to out right unfair. The reason is that once the leader is low or even has low hp to start it feels unfair when you can't stop aimless from snipping the leader in just the short 11 hours i have played i have had to many runs end because the aimless seemed to only aim at the leader and i was unable to kill all 5 of them on the field by the time they did snipe my leader just does not feel good as a player to leave so many enemies to attack randomly. To fix this i suggest just adding a indicator when you hover over them to where they plan on attacking keep it random but show us where it is landing if the players line up stays the same if changed because of another attack changing the players lay out then the enemy changes target location or something to the like allowing it to feel a bit more fair because i knew where it was attacking or have a bit less enemies with aimless 
          - Overburn: To be fair over burn on allies are fine and the enemies that have it is also fine the issue is mainly the ending and how that works knowing that i had a god run as my 4-5 run where i beat the final boss with no issue but now with the endgame mechanic i'm stuck with dealing with a over HP god run boss that once he gets to attack i loss because the amount of overburn i get in that one attack it is just over( to be clear my boss has 54hp and 8 overburn with barrage and with most allies and leaders having low hp pools that's a wipe on that row but the other allies also are problems with 2 willows, berry sis with teeth charm, big berry, 2 plums, and 2 Vesta's (glad they lost double overburn)don't know if hp matters for allies but you try to kill this team before they can attack i wait.) the issue is that overburn on a player is fine but keeping as high on the final boss is bafulling and currently ended 10 runs a few with ink but not a good way to obtain make sit to hard to have by then. My suggestion just if they have overburn half the amount.

- Clans: Clans are great the issue comes with the cards you can get because you have 3 clans but dont lock off the cards that arnt from the leaders clan leads to too many different archetypes competing to be in the players deck it's a simple fix  by having all allies you save being a 2/3 being from the players selected leader at all times making it be more consistent for the playes deck and there skill being needed to beat each fight not luck on a good ally being in the deck and not junk compared to your leader just sucks having a game where i only got allies that apply demonize but have only low attack leaders that dont really get to take advantage of it.

-Store/event: The only issue that i have is that it feels a bit odd that the store sells random charms and the event sells them out right i feel like either the store should also sell charms out right just 1-2 or they should switch this is just a personal thing and i know that don't know how others feel about it just does not make since to me that the store does not sell any at all.

-Leader: The leader system is cool but i feel like you need to give the player a additional reward for there leader when completing a boss where they get stronger and not just the game charm this mainly comes from me having an issue with the final boss i have right now just a small increase like they get more damage because they found a better weapon more health because better cloths or food for more energy to attack sooner and then remove the ability to add charms or restrict it to 1 or something similar may need a good amount of testing but it just sucks having a leader that dies in one hit late game.

-Charms: only issue is having no way of getting rid of charms you won't/cant use, allow us to sell them because having a scrap charm when your deck is summons based. Sucks even more when you don't even see another way to allow you to use it.

-Boss Charm: I don't know if they are more because of said issue but the first one should only affect 1 ally each fight because i lost a few match's where a minion with 9 attack got frenzy and was in the back line while one with teeth charm was in the front just felt unfair that the enemy had more charms then i did and since they are all minion related they are almost all better for them unlike my charm that i got randomly that i could not use yet.

- Unlocks: the unlocks don't feel great to unlock because they don't really impact your run as they should so far i have only bought one from a store and have yet to choose one for my deck because they don't seem as impactful as they should be.

-Pets: pets feel fine but i feel like they need a bit more adjustment they should be a good ally but feel like garbage and a waste of a turn sometimes to play.

-Hot Spring: Most of these allies feel bad to use in most cases considering you had to unlock them and they are barely as good as other allies you already have. 

I really like this game and want it to be great so i'm posting this as a thing to know about and can look into at least to improve the game but being a game designer i understand the troubles of balance and designing but keep it up you guys have a great game here and i want to keep playing it.

However, you can't even display them the way you want because they don't let you mix collectibles from different tables (unless they're from the same genre of pinball tables).  There are also some tables that I've wanted to have for a long time. Yet you can't play them offline. 

I'm sure these guys are just trying to make it right now (with the war between Russia and Ukraine), but all of the previously mentioned things don't make sense to me. Sadly, I can't recommend this game or purchasing any tables unless Zen Studios changes some things. Especially offline play-ability.",0.0

Tables can only be changed so much until they are not real life comparisons.

Some also are deterred by the fact that Pinball FX3 (and its engine) is over 5 years old at this point and shifted to unreal, giving people some decent discounts (or even free transfers) on tables they have previously released (PinballFX2->Pinball FX3) for quite some time. Be wise on your selections.

the content may be identical, but they have been updated and nobody does all their work for free,
so why should you expect to get something for free because of the decision you made?
(facts are facts about issues, but that doesn't mean you can complain when it isn't warranted :) )

You aren't going to get EVERYTHING transferred over for free. You've seen Dark Souls: Remastered, and other games that have been released at the time.
This is why most games that do remasters give discounts (sometimes generous/deep) to the owners of the previous versions. Zen does this in their own way while bringing new tables in on top of that.

Remember: this game is free to play, free to start, to anyone and everyone can make a review here, and this just came to steam.

- ADS is the same for all guns whether it's a pistol or a sniper, which does technically make sense being in space but, it makes swapping weapons mid game basically impossible without changing the setting every time.

 - Can't swap weapons and automatically return to ADS. (personal, but still seems like an oversight when trying to make a fluid control scheme.)

To be honest I am super conflicted about my opinion on the game. Let's start with the good. You get all the D'Avekki goodness. These excellent British actors that (from a couch) bring you into a mysterious town which oozes atmosphere. You get all the D'Avekki tropes... Aislinn De'Ath playing a lady to die for, Rupert Booth voicing the policeman, Cameo-Girl gets a bigger cameo this time and so on. As a fan of D'Avekki, it feels like the family has yet again brought you another wonderful few hours to lose yourself in - and I'm pretty greatful for that. Tim has also learned to not overdo it with the jumpcuts this time^^. Compared to the other titles, the characters are a bit less subtle and a bit more on the nose this time. But the tone has been hit very well. 
If there's one complaint I can bring forward in terms of the whole world-building then it's that for the first time, then, for the first time in a D'Avekki game, the lore has been spiked with animal cruelties, which for me personally is something that drains the enjoyment out of the game. In fact I'm quite angry about that, and especially Sally's remarks in that regard makes this game trash-bin material for me. For me, it's a biggy, but I'm aware this will be irrelevant to most players.

Anyway, let's address the elephant in the room - the gameplay. Now one D'Avekki trope is certainly to take bad UI design and make it the sole gameplay loop. Which kinda works weirdly enough for most of the games, this time though, it's a bit too cumbersome.

So, there are 6 suspects in the game. There are three days, at each day, each suspect will be asked one question by the police, which amounts to ""are you guilty in this aspect"" and the subject will answer with yes, no or maybe. You pick out the person, which answered yes to all three and tadaaa... you win.
All other information is irrelevant. It's unimportant who had the strongest motive and who would be the most capable or just any other background information. It's just these three questions and their answers that matter.

Where the irrelevant fluff information gets used is in unlocking these police questions. Each suspect has three fluff-topics which need to be activated in order. To do that, you hang a painting onto a slot with the corresponding topic and a cutscene will play. The contents are irrelevant, you just need to match the topic. The painting have an ammo-counter, which needs reloading after 6 questions and ammo is scarce. So you can't just ask them all the topics. And the other thing that happens is that the slot will change to show another topic now.
It's not difficult, it's not challanging, it's not compelling, it's not deep, it's just annoying. It feels like they didn't want to make it perfectly easy, so they put the topic-change mechanic in and they wanted the possiblity for the player to fail so they put the ammo-counter in.

Now there are some secrets and some unlocks on repeated play-throughs. So, you're incentivised to play through the game multiple times. There's some randomization going on, but really, even that is done very half-backed, you see the assets not lining up perfetly and so on. Speaking of assets, which the artworks and videos are pretty great, the regular textures and environment certainly aren't. I dig the idea of the art gallery, but the execution is... questionable. Also of course, controls aren't rebindable and a lot of options, such as the fov-slider lack don't show their values.

So, to summerize, this game is an odd mix of the very good and the very bad. It's something where new ground was tested and some aspects sink and some swim. While the atmosphere is stellar, the gameplay is just nothing I could honestly recommend. If you're a fan, I won't read this and will have bought this anyway, which is fine. But if you're new and haven't played the other games yet, start with those.",0.0

You get what you start with and need to make the best of it, which might allow you to think outside of the box.
Take some time to think about each play before you make it, simple.

Now with that out of the way, learning the game can take sometime at first, I think that makes it rewarding in terms of feeding your brain. Chuckle Fish made a banger which was Starbound, I knew I had to buy this because I trust the team and card games have been my kick lately.

The game is perfectly balanced, it's just a skill issue for a lot of players who are too lazy to learn something out of their comfort zone.

2612,783.0,,,,136776751.0,1811990,"I've been playing since it released a few days ago, and the first thing that stands out is the charming, welcoming presentation. The game rides that fun and cutesy atmosphere as a counter to its (current) lack of balance in player agency and difficulty curve during the course of a run.

I gave this a positive score because the devs have stated they're looking at balance, accessibility, and the difficulty curve in their first few patches, and I'm glad they're taking action. I'm also having fun with the various synergies and strategies that are available. That said, I'd also like to have fun while having a chance at making it further in the game. As of yet, I usually die to the first boss. When I do make it past the first boss (either snowman or monkey) I usually die to the first battle past that point. On the rare occasion I make it past that first battle (usually the purple fellas), that area boss wipes me out in seconds as my party is wounded and my map options unhelpful.

First problem: The leader selection is completely underwhelming. Each leader is a random set of variables that either add up to being a potential burden to your team, or a massive boon that establishes your main strategy. If they simply had a couple leaders to choose from, like they do with pets, I think it would be fun to see what you could do, even if you were still offered a random selection to choose from.

Second problem: The difficulty curve ramps up as you enter the first boss fight, a near cliff face you have to scale with a meager deck of scraps. Each boss enemy has two fazes, yet also has numerous waves of enemies on the same timer as a normal battle, swamping you in priority targets, any of which will destroy you as you try to deal with them, or the boss. The battles that show up past this point are carefully crafted sets of synergies that are designed to show you just how pitiful the synergies you have access to truly are. Better hope you have the right type of deck to deal with each combat, or a linchpin card you guard with your life because it can deal with things you couldn't have predicted running into.

Positive 1: Each card feels like it should have a purpose and a place in your party, even if they are simply fodder to guard your leader in some way. There are many different status effects to wield and administer from poison and curses, to yellow bombs and shells. Each has a purpose, each has a strength, and each is used best by the enemy. Its hard to not frame this somewhat negatively, by pointing out how weak these feel when the player uses them, but they are fun to mess around with in the first stage of the game when you have a chance to do so.

Positive 2: Unlocks are a constant flow for the first few runs you have, before they slowly trickle away as your number of runs increase, but your viability remains the same. The pet system is great and offers a lot of choice in how you augment your usually pitiable leader into a decent force on the battlefield. The art is also ADORABLE, and helps in carrying this aspect. While some unlocks feel minimal, considering they mostly add to already rather extensive card pools, others you can feel the impact of, like the multiple factions. I look forward to seeing any other factions they add, as those add to the gameplay more than anything else you have a choice about!

I'm going to stop there for now. Its a great deck-building roguelike, marred by a difficulty that inflates itself by weakening the player's choices and agency and inflating the enemy's strength by providing numerous synergies and frustration-inducing effects that further limit player agency. I look forward to seeing what the team does to address the balance and difficulty concerns, and will update my review accordingly when they do so. I'm optimistic, so I'm starting it with a YES.",1.0

Also if you are the developer reading this, I feel like there are a few charms that could be adjusted. the 3/3/3 charm is almost always negative, the bread charm always is a ""worse charm"" then almost anything else.... and the removing your charm limit is basically never relevant.

It would also be nice if there were varying levels of difficulty you could choose from. The game does have so much potential and im excited to see where the devs take it in the future!,1.0
2634,805.0,,,,136776399.0,1651560,"Very cute game! <3

Still is a work in progress; the early access tag fits well. Devs are really good at responding and actively working on forums, feedback, and possibly on bug fixes soon to come. The game looks really promising, and is a fun little peek at what is to come. :)

I look forward to seeing it grow. :)",1.0
2635,806.0,,,,136776171.0,1651560,"I've enjoyed the game quite a bit, still in very earl access so alot of the content isn't available. It took me roughly 6 hours to get to small kingdom so it doesn't take very long to max everything. So lets do an early pros and cons list:
Pros
-Unique world setting (unlike foundation, settlement survival, and banished which are more medieval realism it's take a more fantasy oriented rout with magic""not available yet"" and heros ""limited gameplay"")
-The art style is eye-caching and stimulating and can be very beautiful
-Not the most hardcore survival city-builder, allowing time to plan relax and just have fun
-Build and overview UI wasn't confusing
-The relationship system it has with other neighbouring kingdoms is quirky and fun
-Every Seasons has effect to the overworld ( not just green for spring/summer/fall and white for winter)

Cons
-NPC AI is dumb (farms and resources gathering are full and no one brings them to the storehouse/granaries or to the homes. Once your city take up half the map people starve even when you have alot of food everywhere)
-Very early access (not alot to do past small city stage)
-Certain core resources are limited (like stone) after you run out that's it you cant build anymore
- NPC AI is REALLY DUMB, I know I said this before but it really breaks this game
- Can only make money from taxes every 6 days. Wish the Inns or store would give you alittle passive income

Overall I had a great time playing this game, even though it was still very limited. A great potential citybuild with a fun little fantasy twist. An awsome pick up for anyone who love the genre. Can't wait so see more content released for it.",1.0

2637,808.0,,,,136777864.0,1183800,"Game inspired by X-COM (the original good one) and stress system from Darkest Dungeon. 

However, game is kinda easy. If you have no experience with this type of games, play on Normal.
If you [b]ever played any X-COM/Xenonauts/Tactics game[/b], play on Hard and thank me later. 

[h2]Main con - Meta-Progression[/h2]
Wish there was more meta progression, right now you can unlock 2/3 of the unlocks in single game. And the rest requires you to actively play bad (like shoot your own team bad). Because unlocks are locked behind achievements. 
So past single run, game doesn't promote any rewards for playing actively well, with no meta-progression or anything. 
Wish that would change.

Anyway, for currect price (on sale), I can recommend it.",1.0

Shattered Horizon was the 1st game I bought on Steam, back when they had that beautiful, clumsy single gun everyone had to use. It took real skill!

 But this game is just not playable for me right now. I have a X5900X CPU, Aorus X570 Master MB, a 2700 Super and 16 GB of ram. The game is installed on a Seagate FireCuda 530 M.2 SSD.  My network card is a 2.5 GB that performs better than my 1GB Intel card. Yet, I have to dial down some settings so the game will stop hitching every couple of seconds, even in the tutorials. The game crashes every minute or two even while going through the menu. Especially while in the keybinds menu! It would be nice if they let us add a comment to our crash reports. 

I thought it was my overclocking of my CPU, or possibly the GPU, so I turned off overclocking. It didn't make a difference. 
I read in the discussions that, being based on Unreal 4, performance issues can be caused by a bad connection, or even an under powered router. I've got the best connection, getting 0 to 50 ping max to several MP games I play. Heck, I believe PUBG is based on the Unreal 4 engine and I don't have these issues. So that seems like total non-sense to me. Maybe it isn't, but not in my case.

It also lacks an important sound option: Choosing your audio devices. I run several and channel stuff through each one. So that would be a really nice addition.

I'm probably going to have to wait a couple of months before this game becomes playable for me.  You've no idea how badly I wanted to be able to buy this game as soon as it came out. But it's just not done yet, so I can't currently recommend it to anyone. Shattered Horizon performed better in its beta stage! When things improve I will definitely recommend it though!",0.0

Gameplay is fun, with the few maps available providing a lot of variety due to varied bombsite placement and dynamic map layouts akin to R6Siege.

This is the first game I've tried on the Pico 4 so this might be due to the haptics of the controller, but the guns can feel a bit weak, not in terms of damage but in terms of gamefeel.

It could certainly do with more varied maps, modes and guns as we go along, but as is it's got everything you need to have fun for many hours, with no bugs to power through. Some things are a bit simplified, but seems to do so to provide a consistent experience. 
The IK system is really well done, with very lifelike movements replicated. It also features a lean system, that let's you use your playspace to lean your ingame body around corners etc. It's very well implemented and having tried it, it feels weird that this isn't a thing in all VR shooters.

- Fun card combos.
- Lots of unlockables.
- Great art and music.

Cons:
- Limited card options out of the gate.

- About 30% of your games will end early due to RNG putting you in an impossible situation right out of the gate.

Overall: It's a fun game that definitely scratches that Slay The Spire itch I have.

2713,884.0,,,,136781403.0,1811990,"I admit the whole controversy about the difficulty just made me buy the game because I was interested in what of it was true. So here I am and 3,5 hourse later I got my first win after 7 or so attempts. That being said I am a veteran who play most deck builders since Slay the spire and have beaten Library of Ruina without mods. I get how many people could have difficulty beating this game. Some encounters are really hard and some are unbeatable if you dont have a counter in your deck. Knowing that counter in your first playthrough is impossible. 

But this isnt unfair. This is a roguelike with progression. Losing and learning are part of the game. Yes it is extremely difficult. Just like learning to swim is difficult. Your gonna dip your head underwater till you learn it. If you dont wnat that, stay out of the pool.

The game itself is fine, has extremely nice art and is quite different from other games of its kind. Turns are played in a way that you play cards, which either place units, companions and scrap items, on the field or have active effects. Each card you play is a turn that reduces the activation of every unit on the field. Those that hit 0 make their actions (attack, heal, whatever). 

With that you try to kill the enemy boss before your boss dies. Your boss is a unit on the field and you can pick one out of 3 at the start each run. Those have randomized HP, Attack, activation time and special effects. Companions can be recalled to be healed, but if they die they´re gone for the battle and have half HP and Attack for one fight after that. 

You also get charms which you can attach to cards. A lot of charms can be attached to units and active cards. So if a charm increases the number of activations that means your unit can attacks twice when it activates or an active card activates its effect twice and so on. You can attach up to three charms to a card which can lead to really silly and busted combos. And you NEED these. The later fights are unbeatable without at least one busted unit. And this is FUN. I love creating busted combos but in most games having these just means you breeze through the run. Here you need ot do this to have a chance. This means RNG is a large part in what you get. If you dont like that, then this isnt the game for you. If you like building the best of what you get with being force to use extremely different tactics each run, then this is the game for you. 

Spoiler for the end of a run:
There also seems to be a mechanic where the deck you win a run with gets possesed by the boss at the end? I dont know what that means yet, I assume you have to fight your own deck at some point. But since I dont have any more time today I cant tell you what that is about.",1.0
2714,885.0,,,,136781243.0,1811990,"I love the game, it's been great fun. My only complaint so far is the lack of counterplay to teeth damage. Unless you have a ton of hp on all your units, or you have built a deck that can direct kill your 10+ hp of problems, teeth damage really don't have the same level of counterplay that all the other keywords have. You can't stop your hero from attacking, so when a unit generates with a random teeth charm on the front line the same turn your hero is ready to attack with their 1 hp, there's just nothing you can do. Which feels extremely punishing for ""bad luck"". 

Unlike most other abilities, neither ink nor frost will bail you out of that situation, and you cannot retreat your hero, so unless you have a self freeze or a kill spell to take out the spawned unit, there's just nothing you can do, which is really annoying.

Developed by Surgical Scalpels, this tactical space-based shooter game offers a unique and exhilarating experience that's unlike anything else out there.

The game's zero-gravity mechanics are a standout feature, creating an entirely new way to approach combat and movement. Engage in fierce team vs team battles, executing low-gravity operations on orbiting space installations against enemy astroperators and other entities. The gameplay is fast-paced and intense, requiring quick reflexes and strategic thinking to come out on top.

Visually, ""Boundary"" is stunning. The graphics and visual effects are top-notch, making every firefight and zero-gravity maneuver feel immersive and realistic. The attention to detail in the environments and characters is also impressive, adding to the overall atmosphere of the game.

One thing that sets ""Boundary"" apart from other multiplayer shooters is its emphasis on teamwork. Communication and coordination are essential to success, and players who work together will have a definite advantage. This adds an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay, making for a more satisfying and rewarding experience.

2743,914.0,,,,136781249.0,2072640,"Bought the game with my friend and we played together for two rounds. The second round in the game we ran into a bug when hiding in the mansion, I saw that the door was closed and my friend saw the door opened. When the door was closed at his viewpoint, the killer didn't come in and only growled outside. When the door was open at his viewpoint (for me door closed), the killer teleported inside the room and killed my friend at my viewpoint. Otherwise because no one was playing the game public, we didn't get the chance to team up with others to see what they make of it. 
Pros:
-Extremely horrifying, especially if you gaze into the old mansion with the flashlight on when the front door is open. the killer will chase you  from an angle. The doubleface-kids and skeleton props are also bloody and designed well.
-Gives the option to mute scream. Most times I don't get scared at the killer's face but the screams I make.
Cons:
-With the flashlight on, the visible range is too narrow. Realistic to see only a short distance, but only having a cylinder range in the middle of the screen, with total black on both sides creates a sense of being trapped in a bad way. I had to constantly turn my head up, down, left and right to look for stuff, which made me feel irritated and gradually dizzy in two hours.
-The vision shakes too much. Adding with the range too narrow, only adds to the feeling of wanting to throw up.

I've won about 4 times our of maybe 7-10 runs. There are really very awesome combos to discover.

There are some cards that I think are unplayable in their randomness. Soulbound Skulls and Ice Dice are the worst offenders I've seen so far, but most cards are quite reasonable.

Overall, it's great. I'm excited to see how the devs will respond to the difficulty and the problem cards, but if you enjoy very challenging, order-of-operations type puzzle games, this is solid game!",1.0
2,,,,,136782663,1811990,"TLDR: If you like deck building rogue-likes and aren't afraid for a tough challenge, you will enjoy this game despite the sometimes unfair nature of the RNG. Don't let the adorable art fool you...this game is for hardcore fans of the genre only.

Pros:
- Interesting decisions to make.
- Fun card combos.
- Lots of unlockables.
- Great art and music.

Cons:
- Limited card options out of the gate.
- Takes a while to gain enough knowledge to mitigate the RNG.
- About 30% of your games will end early due to RNG putting you in an impossible situation right out of the gate.

Overall: It's a fun game that definitely scratches that Slay The Spire itch I have. I am enjoying it, but it's also a bit frustrating sometimes because the enemies and RNG can result in you getting curb stomped without any chance to stop it. That being said, I'd definitely recommend it for those looking for a more intense deck building rogue-like experience.",1.0

There's not nearly enough (or any) 50 and 60-something NPCs with their Trans Am Thunderbirds parked outside in the handicap space and wearing backwards leather hats and JUST their left ears pierced, all playing the intro to Sweet Child O' Mine over each other in broken time and swearing that they're gonna get Nancy and the kids back this Christmas.

31,,,,,136781249,2072640,"Bought the game with my friend and we played together for two rounds. The second round in the game we ran into a bug when hiding in the mansion, I saw that the door was closed and my friend saw the door opened. When the door was closed at his viewpoint, the killer didn't come in and only growled outside. When the door was open at his viewpoint (for me door closed), the killer teleported inside the room and killed my friend at my viewpoint. Otherwise because no one was playing the game public, we didn't get the chance to team up with others to see what they make of it. 
Pros:
-Extremely horrifying, especially if you gaze into the old mansion with the flashlight on when the front door is open. the killer will chase you  from an angle. The doubleface-kids and skeleton props are also bloody and designed well.
-Gives the option to mute scream. Most times I don't get scared at the killer's face but the screams I make.
Cons:
-With the flashlight on, the visible range is too narrow. Realistic to see only a short distance, but only having a cylinder range in the middle of the screen, with total black on both sides creates a sense of being trapped in a bad way. I had to constantly turn my head up, down, left and right to look for stuff, which made me feel irritated and gradually dizzy in two hours.
-The vision shakes too much. Adding with the range too narrow, only adds to the feeling of wanting to throw up.
-Bugs as mentioned above.",0.0

36,,,,,136785379,1811990,"WIldfrost is a new take on a well-trod genre, that of the deckbuilding roguelike.

With an appealing artistic direction, you lead a group of companions through the snowy landscape while facing an array of challenging bosses. At its core, each run is about both creating a strong deck and making tight tactical decision during a variety of combats. Your deck must be one that straddles the line of both having a synergistic means of scaling against increasingly tough threats while also having the versatility to deal with many different threats, which proves an engaging challenge. This is akin to similar games such as Slay the Spire, but the margin for error here is tighter, which is likely the cause for many of the negative reviews. Secondly, each encounter requires maneuvering your units around enemies that are on discrete timers, reminiscent of Through the Breach. 

In testing both dimensions, Wildfrost creates an experience that is greater than the sum of its parts. With some added quality of life features and some balancing (note, the issue here is more about the perception of balance than any actual balance), Wildfrost will become one of the top roguelike deckbuilders if it is not already.

Strong recommend

Edit: Upon looking at the other reviews, at present (April 16, 2023), the English language reviews are 85% positive while all reviews are at ~65% positive, meaning that non-English reviews are less than 50% positive. I'd suspect that there's some issue with how the mechanics are depicted in non-English languages (it seems many of the negative reviews are in Mandarin).",1.0
37,,,,,136785265,1811990,"Charming game. The main draw is probably the aesthetics, though the card battling itself is fairly mechanically unique, which is pretty necessary when the 'indie card rogue-lite' genre is currently so over-saturated. It's currently being review bombed for it's atypically harsh difficulty, which isn't at the level where it's worth being called 'unbalanced' or considered an objective flaw, but the game also isn't exactly marketed as the 'dark souls of card games' or anything, so many players seem to have been blindsided. 

If you aren't afraid of having to put in effort to succeed, or of sometimes losing a run despite your best efforts, these negative reviews shouldn't dissuade you. The game is, in my experience, entirely free of the issues that would otherwise justify a negative review- no performance issues, all the systems function as intended, and the concept of the game is solid.
I would like to see a little more player control over the deck they assemble though. Especially the starting deck. I know this is somewhat antithetical to the genre (the rng is part of being a rogue-like), but setting out with the intention of building a deck around the 'shroom' mechanic, and then completing the run having never been given the option to take even one card related to 'shrooms' can be frustrating in an entirely different way than difficulty. You can already choose your leader and pet at the start of the run, except not really because the available leaders are three randomly generated options, and sometimes they'll all be bad, or just not what you want for your run, and there is no re-roll or quick-restart. This sort of complaint is easily remedied though- just a re-roll button, or 'build your own leader' option, and perhaps a few more systems that unlock more player choice as they progress (like the pets).",1.0

City Builder players who want a fun and relaxing casual experience. If you are looking to try this genre out for the first time, this is the perfect game for you as the entry barrier to learn the game isn't high. The game has a unique characteristic thanks to the art style, the narrator, and a few cute surprises you'll encounter along the way.

[b]How is the game's performance?[/b] 
Gameplay's smooth. It's not a game that requires 144 FPS, and isn't here to eat a lot of your computer's resources. No crashes ever since the game's release apart from the small texture issues. However, there's currently an issue with the game using 100% of your GPU. It's not an issue for everyone though.

[b]What are the devs like?[/b]
Like this game, the people behind it have the same characteristics. It's a pretty small team and they're vocal about the changes they want  to put in that are based out of data they gathered. 

[b]Would you recommend this game?[/b] 
Yes, specifically for the people who think they want something chill, casual, and fun to play especially if they need something in between their hardcore games. I've enjoyed the city building aspect so much.

Not yet for people who want tons of content.",1.0

Normal mode for experienced Turn Based players will be an okay introduction, but the real meat is on hard mode and beyond. The resource management is really loose and allows for rapid experimentation between levels. The stress mechanics play hard and loose early on in the game, but mid-late it's a non-factor.

59,,,,,136787643,1798010,"Despite having a somewhat mediocre font for the English text, it eventually grows well on users who want a more faithful replication of Mega Man Battle Networks 1 - 6. The caveat for languages being only set for the entire game is a disappointment as you cannot change the spoken language of Mega Man only, 
The greatest parts I could not believe were that the majority of the games' region exclusivity differences, for example, in Battle Network 3, each version it's own differences and both also had an exclusive 'Navi Customizer' boot up screen, which used to be a Japanese exclusive ""cut-scene"". 
Overall, the first 3 games in the series are the more tedious and story-line driven games with similarities between them all. A very interesting start to the series but definitely not a bad entry to the Collection.
If you're looking for action though, I strongly recommend starting with 3 as this entry has the most fixes and changes in the battle system. You'll be able to freely ""Customize"" your Mega Man to the best of your features!",1.0

The sound quality is not good when playing the guitar.It sounds like a 1940s radio.
Selecting each string one by one when installing strings is inconvenient. 
I wish there was an option to wire pickups directly.
Additionally, it is inconvenient that the playing guitar button and head machine buttons are too far apart from each other when tuning.
Also, there is a bug where the character keeps moving if you press the W and A keys simultaneously and then release them.
And I'm curious if a system will be added where the method of installing strings varies depending on the type of head machine
When installing a fretboard, compressors are used, but I'm curious why they are not used when installing frets.

It would be nice if there was an option to have guests like Matt Bellamy come and install effectors like on the Manson guitar.
Will Active Pickups be added?
Will Neck-through-body also be added?
I wish there were systems for adjusting the string height, select string guage and requesting drop tunings to the customer's demands. 
And I wish there was a system for directly processing wood according to personal preferences and requirements, which would be different from the existing mass production methods.

70,,,,,136784731,1934520,"I randomly came across this game, and as a massive fan of roguelikes and, more recently, survivor-likes, I found this one to look interesting. It was on sale, but the negative reviews warned of a horrific sounding mechanic where if too many enemies were on the map, your run just ends. Sounds counter-intuitive to this type of game. There was an update just recently where this mechanic was changed from outright killing you to immensely debuffing you instead. I decided to take the plunge with a 20% discount and try my luck.

I did not enjoy it. I couldn't get past the first boss, the first level, nothing. I'm not saying it's all the game's fault, but I found many frustrating, anti-gaming mechanics thrown in here that made little sense beyond packing the game in with frustration. You start off with a very slow firing, low damage bow that fires automatically. You'll get swarmed pretty quickly in this game. The balance of ramping up the amount of enemies versus your own power is very tipped towards the enemy. I found myself hitting the limits of this baffling horde mechanic in no time. Had I played the patch previous, I wouldn't have made it past the first minute in any run. Even with the change, this horde mechanic still helps stack the deck very much against you. I didn't see a reliable way of powering yourself up. The chests are random and may not give you what you need, the ""Sister Statues"" will only buff you if you take a debuff first or will add to the enemy count/decrease your max HP/other penelty if you don't take the blessing, and the first ""boss"" I encountered was a slime enemy that messes with your movement big time by causing the ground to be slippy and force you into obstacles and enemies against your will. It is abnormally easy to be surrounded and trapped against an obstacle, causing a quick and frustrating death. This all coalesces into a gaming experience that is not fun, at least in my eyes. 

Part of the charm of the survivor-like, at least for me, is the power ramp of your character. A bit of a peak of difficulty is expected, but only in line with your own power increase. Every mechanic in this game seems designed to build the difficulty wall and force you to scale it with almost no increase to your own power. It is supremely unfun. 

My last run, which was my best attempt at it, is what decided I was going to refund this. I was slipping around because of the slime boss, not having any real way to even get to it because there were so many enemies on the screen blocking it. These are enemies that will push you around, drain your health quickly, and all of that is multiplied due to the horde mechanic which will almost always be maxed out. I definitely tried seeking out chests, forges, sister statues for blessings (even if they hampered me further). I activated a statue which would give me a random blessing, but the trade off is that I had the slime debuff, on me (which I already had permanently because the slime boss was still alive) until I found a corresponding statue which was marked. I just decided to run there because any help I can get against this ridiculous tide of enemies that I had no real chance against I would take. But, for whatever reason, the framerate started plummeting. I somehow ended up at literally single digit frames where it would skip to a future frame maybe once every few seconds. I was able to pause and navigate the menu okay, but any graphical changes I would make did not help whatsoever (potentially not helped by the simple graphical options I had). My guess was that the mixture of amount of enemies densely pooled together caused the game to deteriorate. For reference, my computer has Intel i9-9900K processor, NVIDIA RTX 2070 Super, and 32 GB of RAM. I should not be experiencing such a thing.

So, the above has caused me to initiate a refund and share my negative experience. It is a shame, because I really like these types of games.",0.0
