## Assignment 1: Predictive Modeling for Airbnb Properties

This chapter presents the findings of the first assignment, where a predictive model was developed to estimate the "price per night" of Airbnb properties in Belgium. The chapter includes the competition results and evaluation metrics.

## Assignment 2: Deep Learning for Image Classification

The dataset is downloadable [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13uqo4de3n0Of1X2Appt_G3WAUXqF3h4J?usp=sharing)

The task focused on image classification using deep learning techniques: distinguishing between food and interior images in the Michelin Guide and predicting cuisine type based on food images. The trained model to classify food vs interior of a restaurant is saved in the same folder with the name `food_interior_classifier.h5`.

## Assignment 3: Real-Time Sentiment Analysis on Steam Reviews

Assignment 3 outlines the findings of the third assignment, which focused on real-time sentiment analysis of reviews from the Steam website. The chapter covers the data collection process, methodology, and results.

## Assignment 4: Graph Analytics on Twitch Data

Lastly, Assignment 4 presents the outcomes of the fourth assignment, which involved applying graph analytics techniques to Twitch data using Cypher. The chapter highlights the approach, analysis process, and key findings.
