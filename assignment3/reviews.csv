16,136555240.0,2156300,In its current state I wouldn't recommend this game. It has potential but if every episode is going to be 30 minutes of game play its not worth it. There were bugs and accessing the pause menu is impossible to work if there's any sort of interaction on the screen. It's impossible to turn the music off and there's no way to roll-back or remove the ui to look at the renders. Also not being able to skip at certain points can get rather annoying and opening the logs just throws up errors. The beta felt longer than all the new content and even then a lot of the new content was already show in the trailers and renders that have been released.,0.0

This game is a perfect combination of card collection, deck building, and tactical combat. It is very easy to pick up and play but has enough depth to encourage replays to improve your strategy.

The hand-drawn artwork in this game is awesome, from the unique and varied card designs to the incredibly detailed backgrounds and interfaces. The music is fantastic and perfectly suits the action in the game. Each card has its own strengths and weaknesses that can be augmented with skills and loot, so each round requires careful consideration and strategic thinking.

Overall I really enjoy Fourteen Fiends for its fun, quick gameplay and the potential for deeper strategy from different combinations of cards. Highly recommended!",1.0
21,136573277.0,1409300,"What a great start by Pendopo Creations to take a debut step in a early Q2 2023. This game kinda remind me of Lacuna and Virtua Verse since those games look pretty similar. But, review is review so I'm gonna tell what I felt and experienced while playing this game. 

Start by the premise of story, Setyo starting to take a step in Bay City as a foreign agent and then as a security of a tech company. While his colleague, Jack, who works in Bureau appearing in Bay City and gave Setyo a bad news about the lost of his sister so it forced Setyo coming back to Neo-Surabaya and find some clues about his sister. All I can say, the plot is properly wrapped in a 6 chapters in total which makes the story more focused. The story doesn't feel rushed at all. Plot is surprisingly attractive so the experience kinda similar as watching a movie. Besides that, the dialog is well written in english. So, from the story aspect, I could say this game is a have a great plot, not rushed, and a well-written dialog. 

For Indonesian folks, trust me, some of the dialog is so much related to our culture and society nowadays. One of my favorite is while there's a conversation talking about ""a department"" of a country that loved to block an access of one of a biggest game marketplace in a world.
Story: 8/10

Move into the gameplay, this game, put it simply, is an action adventure game with a side-scrolling thingy like Lacuna and VirtuaVerse. The most important value that been delivered by dev to this game is at puzzle and combat mechanics. Puzzle mechs are variative which make this game has a bit of repetitive level. I'm sure that you're not gonna get bored while facing all puzzles in every chapter on this game. Okay, let's say some of them are stealth, hacking like a Watchdogs game, bunker code solving, making a key, ""stay calm while disguise"" with a rythm alike system, etc. There's so much variation of puzzle so I can't put it here all one by one. Besides puzzle thingy, this game also have a freedom for us to fight some foes with any weapon and a combat system. A combat system is quite okay, i think. One thing that annoyed me is just an energy and consumable items while in a fight. Energy drought so fast and consumable items a bit complicated since you need to open an inventory first and the consume the item. It will be better IF this game giving us a ""quick action button"" so we don't need to try hard anymore. 
Gameplay: 7,5/10

The graphics is lovely jubbly. Imagine, the composition of 2.5D pixelated game combined with a proper lighting and synthwave colour tone is just right. It looks satisfying. This game is actually worth for some players who loves to see a pixelated or cyberpunk game themed. Give it a try!
Graphics: 8.5/10

Finally, talking about sound/audio. All I can say is the background music is well delivered in any situation so the tense properly build up while playing the game. When we need to be relax, stressed, pressured, it's all depicted good by a presence of a cyberpunk themed music. 
Sound: 7/10

So, in the end, the pros and cons of this game are
Pros:
+Better plot, movie alike and doesn't feel cheap. 
+Puzzle mechs variative which makes the experience doesn't feel bored.
+Dialog is well written, some of them talking about Indonesian culture and society issues
+Oooomagaaa, the graphics bro, beautiful. 
+There is so many Indonesian thingy in a game like tukang sate, kang cilok, preman, pertunjukan seni, etc while the game is delivered to be fantasy futuristic. 

Cons: 
- Game still buggy and stuck at loading because of steam overlay. pro tip: don't ever open a steam overlay while playing the game. Let's hope the dev will fix it, asap.
- Combat system duh idk, all i want is a ""quick action button"" and some clarity improvement while in a stealth mission. 
- Bahasa Indonesianya ga ada cookkk, semoga ntar ditambahin hehe, ksabar.
- There is no manual saving

Overall, this game is at 7,75/10. Is this recommended? Yes, it is recommended. With this rate of price, you can get an experience of exploring to a deep down of an Indonesian greatest civilization with hi-tech thingy with a great story and puzzle mechs. Let's go give em a try!

25,136574485.0,1949030,"I'm only 4 hours in but I wanted to say that I love this game. It's different from the other Frogwares Sherlock Holmes games in that you are solving one grand overarching mystery rather than individual cases, so I haven't had the experience of having to pick who I thought did it with what in that intense and wonderful way that the other games have, but the story that it is telling is so damn compelling that I don't care. I'm still finding clues and slowly piecing together what's happening, all while people are dying and crazy supernatural stuff is happening around me.

The juxtaposition of Lovecraft and Holmes works perfectly, the aesthetics combine well, and I love Holmes' analytical mind trying to work out why there's weird supernatural bullshit happening. I'm super excited to find out what is going on. 

On the mechanical side, this game uses the same engine as Chapter One but adds some excellent quality of life improvements. For one, I think the open world was a detriment to Chapter One, and this one is much more linear which is good. For another you can click Z to have all of the interactable items pop up around you, which is an amazing thing to have in this sort of mystery adventure game.

Special shoutout to the characterization, writing, and acting of Watson in this, he is so good.

It is fun and quite relaxing but sadly there is not enough gameplay for me to come back to the game if this is the ""Final"" version.

28,119682629.0,1729900,"Now let me get this out of the way. The game has potential. But right now it's very clearly unfinished. My first problem is there being no tutorial, thankfully somebody posted a guide explaining the basic mechanics. Apparently there's a flow mode and different characters have different things they specialize in (For example: More damage but you take more damage, stronger flow mode, etc.) But I didn't even realize this for the first 10 minutes since none of this is explained to you. Even the guide doesn't specify what character does what. Also, speaking of characters. Their designs for most of them are unfinished. One character looks like they got somebody else to draw smoothly. The rest though are hand drawn models that look like a deveant art OC. Hell, in actual matches there's not even the character model. Just a rough sketch with basic outlines. Now (In my opinion) the worst thing about this game is there's no online multiplayer. Sure you CAN play with friends. But that seems local only. It could be a 6/10 with the online multiplayers, but without it (including the rest of my points) it drops down to about a 4-5/10. Fix all these issues and you got a solid 7-8/10 rythm Game.
TLDR; Add a tutorial and online multiplayer, along with finishing the characters and you get a solid game.",0.0
29,118681190.0,1729900,"Rhythm Brawl is a laughably poor Guitar Hero ripoff with an adversarial bent as you play a 3 button rhythm game to some pretty craptastic music and wonder why Valve doesn't have the quality control for Steam it so badly needs.  There's a few different game modes and you can play PvP or vs the computer or just watch the computer play itself, this is convenient because while the computer is playing itself you can go find a pencil to rupture your eardrums so you don't have to listen to the crap music anymore.  Very thoughtful of the developers there. 

The nicest thing I can say about this is that it doesn't use 2D retro pixel ""art"".  Unfortunately, instead, it uses some of the most eye gougingly bad high school art class dropout drawings (I won't deign to call that scribbling ""art"") instead.  Like really bad.  Pixel art would be better, seriously, it's atrocious.  The developers indicated they would replace it, but that hasn't happened yet, so the game gets judged for what it is. 

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the Godot game engine/toolset.  This is a very poor quality toolset sometimes used by amateur developers as it's free (so they don't have to pay for GameMaker Studio) and doesn't require advanced game development skills, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities (it's arguably worse than GameMaker Studio).  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.

They're seriously trying to charge money for this, $4 USD plus an eye watering $8 USD to unlock the rest of the game they haven't finished (yeah, there's DLC for an incomplete Early Access game, that's not okay to the point of being unethical).  All that for a business model to try compete with Spotify by charging $12 USD for 6 crap songs on Steam.  Ugh.  If you play this game I recommend proactively seeing an oncologist afterwards.",0.0
30,121230865.0,1729900,"Rhythm Brawl, unlike most games I don't recommend, has A LOT of promise. I VERY MUCH so hope this game gets an update that fixes all issues, because I believe that this game could be something magical if fixed in the future. also I HIGHLY encourage the developer/developers to reply to this message once an update is put out! I would love to change this review to a recommend.

First off, A LOT of the art is unfinished. I'm of the belief that if you plan on making a commercial product, you HAVE to finish those kinds of assets beforehand. I understand this game is in Early Access, but this feels like an EARLY EARLY ACCESS. A would love to also see different character have different passive abilities and maybe an attack move that's different per character. More music would be awesome as well. 

Along with this, online play would be huge for a game like this. My final thoughts are that if you add Steam Workshop this could be the defacto Rhythm Fighting game that people have been begging for. You have something special here. Please add Steam Workshop. Other than that, if the game fixes these issues, this will be an incredible game.",0.0

You can view my initial impressions review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/9Wax1TLL-gc

Anybody who follows my reviews knows that I absolutely love VR roller coaster / amusement park rides. So this game should be right up my alley, a fun twist on the coaster formula with some action adventure thrown in. 

Yeah, this game took everything I enjoy about coasters and made it into a bland, repetitive game that sucks all the joy & thrills from fun rides. It's a poorly made game on the Unreal Engine. At least it seemed be to be running at a steady 90 fps on my RTX 3080 and it did not crash. That ends anything positive I can say about this experience.

The visuals are ugly. The UI is horrible. Your motion controllers (at least on the Quest Touch controllers) are mis-aligned with your avatar pickaxes / shield that you hold. The feedback from any action is terrible. I couldn't tell whether I had hit an object or if I had correctly blocked or dodged out of the way. The sounds are bad as well. The music is bad. The gameplay is bland and repetitive. 

I would not recommend this game if it were free to play. I wanted to quit after 30 minutes of gameplay. I went with my gut feelings to quit and do anything else. Maybe someone out there can play this game for longer than 30 minutes, but for my own sanity I will uninstall this game and never play it again.

It's nuts and easily one of the better ""Vampire Survivor-likes"" out there. If you're looking for a wild time where you spent a few minutes between rounds figuring out a ton of gimmicks to chain together to create utter nonsense before you fight again, this is for you. It's more or less an ""engine building"" game, where one thing triggers another thing and efficiency buffs damage and things... Start off with a simple Spine and a tentacle gun, make it so that tentacle gun bursts into a giant skeleton blade on contact and poisons things. Use another brain to maybe build a function that connects all enemies who are poisons to be chains together by a death beam that saps their health for five seconds. Now do that for a default (for most prototype characters) for 8 total modules and level up to maybe 12, and up to four brains doing different things. Want to go summoner? Take a Queen and pick up every spawn thing you can, make them shoot instead of you or carry around debuff clouds. Want to machine gun things? Take a bunch of piercing tentacles and boxer nerves to trigger a lot of ""on hit do this"" commands. Don't worry about committing to stuff... you can tear these structures all down and reuse your components or sell them off between fights. Also has a trial mode so you can test your crazy thing before you actually have to worry about dying. 

Freaking fantastic. Thoughtful, strange, and something to really make you think a bit to optimize. Only real complaint at the moment is enemies mostly just run at you at various speeds and take more or less damage. Feels like they're just messing around to get all the node building right at the moment and maybe enemies become more interesting in the future. Still, worth it just to screw with.

[i]Simple Sky[/i] is top-down twin-stick space-shooter/score-chaser with some unique ideas. The simple and bright artwork gives the game a friendly appearance, but after I headed into the main game, I quickly realized that it gives the player no quarter. There are 10 difficulty settings, and only two are unlocked in the very beginning. Well, so far, I have yet to unlock another. Please keep in mind that this game is in Early Access currently, and some of my discussion may be outdated by the time you are looking at the game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The idea is simple, you start off as a ship with a main and secondary weapon, all of your movements use your energy reserves that spontaneously regenerate, and every action has a cooldown. Enemies start coming after you in what almost seems like a survival arena and you need to fend them off until the boss encounter for that particular stage, after which you can complete the stage and move on or stay behind to gather some more resources, though with a finite absolute time limit. There's a visual countdown to when things start going haywire if you stay too long, so it's not difficult to gauge this.

During your time spent on any level, finding local planets of various sizes and mining their resources will be very important. These resources are currency that you also get by killing enemies and you can upgrade your ship every time you reach a preset ""value."" You need to be docked on a planet while you upgrade, and this isn't difficult, you can run headfirst into a planet and that counts as docking.

When you make an upgrade, you are given a choice from 3 random selections. You can gradually maximize your firepower, your abilities, your cooldowns, HP, etc. through your various upgrades. You can even increase how many selections you get when you upgrade. If you get lucky early on, you can take an upgrade to make it possible to upgrade mid-flight, which doesn't seem like much, but is actually a huge boon. Or at least I think so.

In each level, you are constantly being hunted by the boss, which slowly approaches you from afar. You can see where it is and where you are, along with locations of the different planets on the minimap. It would seem that either avoiding the boss in the beginning or heading right in may each have its own benefits, I have yet to figure out the perfect strategy.

The individual runs in this game are usually pretty short. If I don't have a good combination going for me from the first few upgrades, I find that I can rarely make it to or past the 2nd boss. With some nice upgrades working in nice synergy, I was able to get to what I thought to be the final boss on the easiest difficulty, though I still struggled to live to the end. I would say average runs for me when things are going well are around 15 minutes or so.

There is a lot of movement based on your momentum, and because you are a ship moving around in space, you can expect to have some arcing movements and annoying ""sliding-on-ice"" feel as you try to maneuver around. This is just something to get used to, it's a game decision that will make a lot of people throw their hands in frustration but it's a decision specifically for this game. Once you get used to it, it won't feel so bad.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
Keyboard and Mouse required, and for some reason I had to launch this on my laptop, since on my main PC, the keyboard was being recognized in the menu, but once the run started, it wouldn't respond. I do hope that this gets hashed out and not too many people buy and need to refund due to unrecognized keyboard controls.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The artwork in this game is nothing to write home about, everything is pretty simplistic in design. It has bright colors and simple designs that give it a bit more friendly appearance, but the game mechanics beg to differ.

[h1]Music & Sounds[/h1]
The music gets super repetitive, to the point that I had to turn it off

[h1]Audience[/h1]
This is where I struggle a bit. I would say more for people who don't mind repetitive deaths and are okay with working through the initial slow bits in an arena-survival/shooter game. The run becomes more enjoyable when you can survive the initial start-up phase, which can be over quickly if things fall in nicely, but can also draw on for a while.

[h1]Pricing[/h1]
Early Access base price is $9.99 with regional pricing. It does have some replay value in that you are trying to chase the high-scores in kills during your runs while also trying to beat the game as fast as you can--the two leaderboards on Steam. I think the price is fair as far as people who enjoy the game are concerned. Those who cannot stand it have plenty of time to experience it prior to making a decision to refund, if truly they determine it's not worthwhile.

[h1]Personal Wishlist[/h1]
1. Have the issue fixed so I can play on my main computer, but the problem is that I have no idea what the issue is.
2. Having a bit simpler initial stages of each run when it comes to upgrades. I find that it's the part I enjoy the least and it tends to drag on for a while, and for me that's the do-or-die part of the run. If I make it, the rest of the run is enjoyable, if I die, then I have to start over from scratch and keep my fingers crossed.
3. More clear-cut synergy effects when upgrading, maybe showing some numbers/stats or highlighting which other prior upgrades will benefit, etc. It would be nice to know whether I am making a good decision or not when upgrading.
4. The mid-flight upgrade option comes up infrequently and I personally dislike the fact that I have to dock to upgrade prior to getting this. I almost wish the requirement to dock to upgrade would be removed completely.
5. More weapons/upgrade options, etc.

Bottom line in regards to this section is me saying that for these kinds of games to keep me interested, I need to see faster earlier progress to get to the fun parts, to keep me coming back and playing another run. It's not difficult to start another run after the previous, but the desire to immediately start is definitely hindered by the knowledge of the beginning grind. It may be only a few minutes, but it's enough to make me hesitate. With that and some additional QoL changes to facilitate smoother and more streamlined gameplay, I would enjoy it a lot more.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[i]Simple Sky[/i] is overall pretty fun, and so far I am enjoying myself. I realize that this game is in Early Access and so I hope to see some improvements in the aspects that I have requested, just to make it even more fun. I have confidence in that this developer will make the game better from its current build as there seems to be an update every time I look at it, especially with the latest one around a request that I had made.

Current score 7/10 (written Oct. 9, 2021).

Thank you for reading.

67,136574855.0,1811990,"So something interesting- While I love roguelike deckbuilders, I frequently find myself frustrated with them. Slay the Spire, Dicey Dungeons, etc, they're fantastic, but bad luck can be extremely frustrating.

I'm not having this problem with Wildfrost.

Now obviously I've only played an hour so far, and I definitely haven't made much progress, but every time I've died so far, I've always felt like it's my fault in some way, whether I made a stupid decision or didn't prepare well, and even in the times when RNG has screwed me via lacking options for card synergy or in-battle junk, it still feels so much less frustrating than in other roguelike deckbuilders. I think this is partially because of the way the gameplay is structured; there's no obvious endpoint, just a continuing path, and you're not spammed with cards or the like. Every encounter keeps you incredibly invested with how you're strategizing, and even when you lose, the progression with the town can help you still feel as though you're making progress.

If you really want to try this game but aren't entirely sure, I'd say go for it. I'm having a blast so far and the literal only reason I'm taking a break after an hour is because I, unfortunately, have important things to do T_T But I will absolutely be back ASAP to see more of this game.

87,136514584.0,2227150,"Pretty neat platformer, controls are tight. Jumps are easy to make, and a good variety in stages. I'm going to lead with letting you know this game is very short, but it is enjoyable its entire duration.

 I think a good thing to do after beating all the levels and collecting all the 40 (? it was an even number I arrived at and I stopped seeing anymore) green coins is to try to beat all the levels with sub-one minute times. The levels feel like they're specifically engineered for this time frame in mind and it forces you to play creatively. 

I want to see this expanded into a larger game. I think the mechanics are polished and the understanding of how to implement platforming gimmicks is there. The dev is obviously very skilled at what they do. I think I got more than 3 dollars of fun out of this. I think an expansion on the concept should provide a purpose to the in game timer, such as beating a dev time or maybe a standalone collectable like the crash bandicoot games.

This is a ringing endorsement but I am going to post the few observances I have with the game after this, as well as my level times. (played with a controller)

good
+ All platforming is incredibly tight and telegraphed very well. 
+ The little overworld is very fun to navigate however small it is. There is one out of the way place that immediately opens a warp after getting it and you can actually skip a few intended platforming parts using the core mechanics.

neutral
= there is an acceleration you have with gliding, it feels like the opposite of what gliding would normally do. I consider this neutral because after you get used to it it feels very satisfying to move around, but there is a learning curve.
= physics with any moving stage gimmicks can be odd at times. It's consistent and you can actually use little things like leverage from spinning platforms to push yourself upwards a bit for more air but it may not do what you expect at first.
= In my opinion, I think the gold coins should be finite. It would give an easy third goal to the areas, and you can very easily afford everything even without the respawns. being able to grind it feels like I didn't earn it. I don't know how much I can criticize the economy in a 3d platformer though. 

bad (these are really really minor issues)
- recovery from a dive seems inconsistent. Sometimes I can recover and other times I feel like I can't and go barreling off the edge. This feels intentional but I couldn't get a feel for what triggered specific reactions.
- The camera snap during the sections where you're repeatedly hitting boosts is a little jarring. This only happens once or twice.
- I would like a little page in the menu that tells you all the information from the levels you completed. this is small but would be important for a larger game. It would have made tracking my level times at the end slightly easier too.

[b]+ A captivating twin-stick shooter metroidvania game with a physics-based grapple and engaging story!ヽ(´• ω •`)、[/b]

[h1][b][1] Intro [/b][/h1]
Rusted Moss is a twin-stick shooter metroidvania game that features a physics-based grapple and full 360° aiming system. Set in a wasteland once inhabited by humans, this game provides a challenging and immersive experience that allows users to feel in complete control of their character.

[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]

The game's twin-stick shooter aspect emphasizes tight and precise gunplay, with players quickly switching between their arsenal of weapons to best suit their playstyle and situation. Players can get up close and personal with a shotgun before grappling away and pulling out a sniper for the killing blow.

The grappling hook is the standout feature of the game, which takes some time to learn but is ultimately rewarding to master. The physics-based elastic grappling hook allows players to latch onto any moss-covered structure and swing their way through the rugged terrain. The freedom created by the controls creates a smooth experience, allowing for creative solutions to flexible traversal challenges.

The game offers a challenging experience, with powerful witches and machine monstrosities as the bosses. Each boss fight throws its own unique challenge at the player, requiring them to push their gunplay and grappling hook skills to their limits. Players must dodge swords, avoid energy fields, and blast away at conjured spiders to progress.

The game features beautifully melancholic pixel art with a retro vibe and modern aesthetic, bringing the world of Rusted Moss to life with moody pixels and stylish animation. The game also offers customizable strategy and gameplay, multiple endings, and encounters with humans and fae folk who are trying to find their way through the world.

[h1][b][3] Verdict [/b][/h1]
In conclusion, Rusted Moss is a fantastic metroidvania game that provides a challenging and immersive experience with its physics-based grapple, twin-stick shooter gameplay, and engaging story. The game's pixel art and aesthetic add to the overall experience, making it a must-play for fans of the genre.

This game is a MASSIVE step up from the first game in every way. The music, the movement, the effects, the editor, literally everything. All of the tracks are diverse with different genres that one or two might have a special place in your heart, the movement being silky smooth makes the experience much more better and doesn't feel clunky at all, (unlike Soundodger+) the effects give the levels a much more stronger vibe to them and the freedom you have in the editor this time is insane. The game can sometimes not be very friendly with new players I'm gonna be honest and adding the shatter system on top of that can definitely ruin a players experience if they just want to play all of the levels for fun, but for people who want a challenge will most likely enjoy it. I've mostly spent my time on the editor on this game, but the main levels are really fun to play and the challenge level have cool mechanics that challenge your skill in unique and different ways. The easy and normal levels sometimes can feel lackluster, boring, slow, empty, etc. The advanced and expert levels can give you the real fun of the game.

132,136513050.0,2334560,"The concept and art are fine, but the game's mechanics and other design decisions prevent it from being enjoyable to play. 

The protagonist of the tale is a mixed-race fox who aspires to be something other than an alcoholic slacker. Let's just say that the story is quite basic and that your overall goal is to change your destiny.

The game plays like any other action/platformer. You can jump, scale walls, and attack. You immediately realize that the stamina system is involved in all actions, which is fine when done correctly and just for certain acts. However, in this game it’s highly aggravating because jumping also depletes your stamina. Platformers require a lot of jumping, thus you'll spend most of your time waiting for it to fully recharge before making a jump. Then wait once again on the following platform. And again.

The same goes for combat. Each battle becomes a chore due to the very slow recharge. You're moving around wasting a lot of your stamina trying to gather enough for just one hit. When you have enough experience points, you can increase your stats, but you must first kill enemies who use a totally absurd mechanic.

Enemies are brainless. They will follow you anywhere you go if you are in their line of sight, including across ledges, into pits, under spikes, etc. It is usually simpler to lure them into traps, which kill them and leave their corpse hovering in the air.

The game goes with old-school style of progress, which means linear path and no option to revisit stages. Even if stages include numerous paths and secret spots with gold and treasure, it's difficult to collect everything because it's so easy to die. Furthermore, if you just head for the exit, you can make things much tougher for yourself because each coin and experience point is valuable.

The overall difficulty of the game was the final straw that broke my back. There are traps everywhere, coming out of nowhere and taking cheap shots at you. Even if you survive falling into a hole, you most likely won't have the strength to climb out.

What makes this even more annoying is the lack of checkpoints. If you die, everything you collect is lost and entire progress reset. Any kind of exploration is entirely discouraged because you don’t want to spend time by carefully navigating the stage, collecting everything you can and then get killed by a stray arrow.

If you're like me and you're desperate for anything remotely good in VR, this will not suit your needs more than likely. Unless you and a friend are okay with wasting money on a thing you'll probably play for 20 minutes, then, I don't recommend this game. 

The physics is... fine? It's better than most other VR titles, and the full body part is the best aspect of it. However, meleeing with anything feels very bad, there's no sense of impact or collision. You can stick things to other things and make weird things, so in that way it's like GMOD but with like 3 tools. Gun, flight, and sticking things to other things. In it's current shape it's not worth the price of admission, and I couldn't convince any of my friends to get this game, so this is a review from the perspective of someone who put more hours than I'm willing to admit into single player GMOD. 

The interaction spheres appear under alarmingly specific circumstances, the gun interactions are bad/very inconsistent. Even holding things seems wonky, since I picked up two things with one hand, which I don't believe was intentional, because when I dropped both one permanently was stuck to my interaction button, so if I tried to take a mag out of my pocket, it would send me flying toward the corner of the map, since the 'jet' thing was still bound to my hand despite clipping into the ground never to be found again. I experienced this bug within like 15 minutes of play, and it happened to *both* of my hands. It seems like too big of an oversight. 

That being said, if this game got workshop support, fixed their interactions, upgraded melee, and allowed people to make some mini-levels to coop through with your friends (puzzles, combat, etc) or even had a miniture proof of concept coop campaign or even a wave mode, this game might begin to be worth your time and money. I went in with pretty low expectations, and even those weren't met. 

I'm not the biggest fan of Boneworks/Bonelab, but this game needs a few more months of [b]core changes[/b] to come even remotely close to the level of physics and interaction those games achieve. I understand this is likely a much smaller dev team with far fewer resources, but there's a lot left on the table for them to address.

I enjoyed what it had to offer, more so on the character side who are all written well with decent enough motivations. The problem that lies in the narrative is the fact that this is not a game that has concrete ending. I had actually seen a D23 article this morning stating that there will be more Tron games by Bithell Games.
Last bullet point in this article [b] (https://d23.com/decoding-the-grid-a-conversation-with-tron-identity-producer-heidy-vargas/) [/b]

Why this was not said long before the game came out that this would be a multi part story is beyond me. Maybe I missed this information? Someone please correct me if so

Another positive about the story is that choices actually matter, given how many AAA games tote this saying plenty of times without delivering, this deserves to be commended, granted I will say the outcomes of your choices are very obvious and have very little surprise to them but that's fine given the scope of the game.

[h1] Game-play wise [/h1]
There is only type of puzzle which is not at all challenging. It appears quite frequently, almost at every story juncture with a certain character, due to the short run time of the game it thankfully never outstays it's welcome. It can also be skipped if you don't care much about it. 

[h1] Tron wise [/h1]
The tiny little nods and references to the movies (achievement names, certain codex entries) were well done. The new additions to the lore are cool and feel like they fit. World building is very subtle yet it's enough to set the stage of the world but it very much a start for the obvious sequels to come. The music is quite good, it's no Daft Punk or Joseph Trapanese but it's up there and is honestly quite memorable.

The game's controls are responsive, and the progression is well-paced. Throughout the levels, our goblin collects scattered coins which can be spent on upgrades, such as the beloved double-jump. Cleared levels can be replayed at any time, allowing him to access previously unreachable areas with his newfound abilities. For those seeking an extra challenge, the game can be completed without any upgrades, with an achievement as a reward. From time to time the goblin will encounter bosses, which, although easier compared to the levels themselves, are creative and add a nice variety to the gameplay.

An interesting aspect of the game is that all the sound effects are created using the developer's voice, which may initially feel unusual and take some time to get used to. Some players may find it awkward or irritating. However, it's worth noting that the game was made by one person, and this unique approach to sound effects adds to its overall ""hand-crafted"" feel.

It's impossible to die completely in this game. When all continues are lost, the goblin is sent to the Underworld level with infinite attempts (after all, you can't die when you're already dead), and clearing it resurrects him with 15 extra continues. This process can be repeated indefinitely, ensuring that the player won't lose all of their progress and have to start over. However, the game can still provide a challenge, especially for those aiming to collect all the coins.

Overall, this game is a great choice for satisfying old-school platforming cravings. It never gets boring thanks to unique and varied level designs, enjoyable boss fights, appealing pixel art, and just the right amount of difficulty to keep the player engaged. The only minor downside is that it runs at 30 fps due to engine limitations, but it doesn't detract from the overall experience. 
Give it a try – you might just enjoy it.

There are a ton of unique operators to pick from, team based gameplay in which each person fills in their own role, fun co-op missions, various game modes, and no P2W. If you're a fan of third person shooters, tactical shooters, or shooters in general, you absolutely should give Caliber a try.

As someone that has been playing games since the early 90s, I would like to thank the developers for not only listening to the community in order to improve this game, but for making such a game to begin with. Caliber offers up a nostalgic experience, harkening back to a time when shooters weren't mindless, and horribly generic. You've done good, 1C. Keep it up!",1.0

Remember Ghost Recon phantoms? SOCOM? 
Any third person shooter that relies on teamwork?

This is game made for fans of that, if youre BF or CoD player coming here with ""Oh it doesnt have first person"" move along this aint for you anyway.
As a third person shooter this game has it everything you need to enjoy, while animations arent top notch like in GR Breakpoint, this game does it decent enough.
Guns feel good and different.
There is one problem that new players might enncounter and that is famous grind.
New players might get overhelmed by amounnt of grind u need to put out, but this is better system thann it was before, where you would have to buy new operators only with gold (each week u would get 3 new operators that would b availeble for blue credits).
All to all - You like third person? You have time? Dont mind a grind? GO FOR IT!!!

179,136565458.0,2094270,"Lightracer Spark is a visual novel set in a Sci-Fi world. It's pretty much a narrative game where your choices matter as you progress through story. There are also some strategy elements, such as building various buildings, collecting resources, implementing space stations modules etc. I have to say that this game really surprised me how well made it is. 

Story/Narrative:

I have to say that story is quite well written and everything is connected with each other. There is a lot of text to read, a lot of choices to make. Currently you can only play Chapter 1 (new chapters will come as DLCs) that has many mini chapters in it, and as you progress the story, you're able to learn a lot about who you are, what is your mission and what you're capable of doing. Prologue is some sort of Tutorial that shows you and teaches you how to play the game. The other chapters are specific stories that tell you about certain events. Now, the biggest pat of this game is that as Amender (controller of planets and universes) you have specific traits that influence the story. You can pick between 5 different paths and each brings unique traits and bonuses. In the story there will be some choices that you can complete and they have difficulty, ranging from very easy to very difficult. They do somewhat influence the story as it makes you get different ending and you don't collect all the information needed but the higher traits you have, the easier it is to complete them. For example, you'll have to talk about history of certain civilization and to complete that choice, you'll need decent knowledge on ""Strange Worlds"" that is a specific trait in the game. All in all, I have to stay that story is quite unique and it does get you hooked but I just wish that developers added the button that you can speed up the text since most of the time you yourself have to click Continue in order to progress through story and text is quite slow which leaves you enough time to read everything.

Strategy elements:

I personally think strategy elements don't influence the game that much. Yes, you have to collect resources such as energy points, technology points and population in order to complete some chapters, but at the same, you collect those quite fast and buildings are quite cheap to build. You can also upgrade them which allows you to gain resources faster. There are special buildings that do require some effort to build, and they bring you various bonuses and materials that are later required to build certain buildings. In general, it's not time consuming but you'll sometimes forget that they even exist or forget to upgrade them since you're mostly focused on the story. There is also war in this game. I personally think it's quite unfair for other provinces and countries to get attacked by you. Because you're technologically stronger and the higher population you have, the easier it is to recruit troops. Enemies are quite easy to kill and they won't pose a threat. I think it's more beneficial to just focus on your military rater than pure resources. 

Issues:

Even though the story is quite well written, music and images are well made, I can't suggest this game for everyone. First of all, the mechanics of the game are quite easy to master and the game doesn't offer much content. Yes this is visual novel, but at the same time developers could have given us something more unique to do in between the stories and the stories progress way toooo fast. As soon as you're done with one mini chapter, you can instantly go to the other. As I already mentioned, building and waging war isn't anything special and it really doesn't bring you much. Time in the game can be slowed down or fastened up. If you have enough time to read through chapters and chapters of the story and you really do like to immerse yourself in futuristic world where AI helps you with everything, then surely this game is for you.

Pros:
+A lot of game modes, both PvP and PvE. Not all of them are equally populated but you can find a match even in not so popular modes pretty fast.
+Over 60 characters to choose from. Different operators offer different playstyles, some are good for mowing down bots, some are perfect for PvP.
+Nice visuals with decent system requirements.
+No 'pay2win' - all operators can be purchased with ingame currency (and you don't need to grind for weeks to buy one you like).

Cons:
-Visual customisation system are lacking. You can apply different camos to the operator but most ot it can be obtained only during events or for premium currency. Nearly all of the skins with really unique looks are premium.
-Leveling up the operator can be tiresome - later levels require lots of XP and credits to grind.

188,136569545.0,2156300,"I'll preface this by saying, it's still very early, and this is just one episode, but here are my impressions so far.
1.  There are really no options.  You have one woman to impress and god forbid you choose wrong in one of the options you have, she'll friendzone you.  If you didn't find her attractive (and I really didn't--she was too heavy for my taste), then too bad.  She's the only choice in the game so far.
2.  No roll back.  Did you hit one of the choices accidentally?  Too bad. Replay the entire thing, or create tons of saves as you go.
3.  This next one goes towards the ""dating sim"" aspect.  If the one woman pisses you off (which she did), there's no option to tell her to go **** herself and walk off.  You're forced to be nice.  I would really have liked a ""b*tch, I have enough friends"" option.  I've never let a woman friendzone me IRL, and I certainly don't want to do it in a game.  There's great satisfaction in ghosting women like that.
4.  I suppose because it was by the same people that did College Kings, I was expecting at least the chance to have some good, meaningless sex.  That was not to be the case.  I suppose this game is G rated, or PG at best.  My hope is that the more episodes that come out, the more this will change.  I can ""not have sex"" with as many women as I want IRL. There's no need to go to a game to do it.
5.  I both understand and enjoy the necessity to build up to a relationship.  It was my favorite part about games like BaD and College Kings, but both of those games gave you significant feedback when you did something that would cause a girl to friendzone you, or not like you, or whatever, and you weren't friendzoned... you were merely ""in progress"" and the girls kind of let you know that.  In this episode, I got friendzoned and had no idea why.  None.

Again, however, this is all after just one episode.  Perhaps there's still hope and I do look forward to the upcoming episodes, but the lack of a rollback option is just AWFUL!  If you want to add an ""ironman"" mode where you can't rollback, by all means, do so.  I generally do my first playthrough keeping as true to how I would personally answer as I can and some kind of ironman mode for that would be fine, but to force everyone to play that way every time is absurd.

TLDR: As far as the final recommendation, I'm going to say for those seeking an AVN, this isn't it.  This is a teenage visual novel at best... no adult content whatsoever.  The dialogue is fun, even funny at points, but in it's current 1 episode state, I can't in good conscience, recommend it in its current state.  I will update the review as new episodes are released.",0.0

The progression unlocks different tribes (card sets) and some new cards, but the cards you have in the beginning are completely valid to win a run.
Cards can be upgraded in a run to focus on different builds.
The art style is amazing. The UI is great, it runs smooth and the music is incredibly cool.

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Setting & Writing[/h3]
Without much preamble, your non-customizable character is dropped onto a tiny speck of land in the middle of the sea. Soon you notice the ability of creating more squares of terrain around you, and do so to expand the world map itself. There’s no story or lore to speak of, other than you have to survive in the wilderness by any means necessary, as the night is dangerous, while the day is peaceful.

 As much as sandbox games can be far from being story-oriented, the complete absence of any narrative element is a strong malus when there isn’t enough variety to compensate for it. The world itself is composed of tiles belonging to various biomes, each has a colorful and vibrant palette, but also feels static; there are no changes in the weather, and no interactions between confining climates or between animals, monsters and plants. Like a diorama with a few moving parts.

[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]
You’ll explore the world you yourself create on foot, or later on via mounted animals. Speaking of expansion, each new day will have you choose some “cards” belonging to different biomes, to then place them as tiles to expand the map. Each climate has different animals and resources, so varying the composition is fundamental to access all materials for crafting. 

The sense of discovery typical of an open-world survival is largely lost and washed-out, as even after many days the explorable world, including the underground level and the “enchanted dimension”, all matching in size, will still be small in size. You won’t even need a map for orienteering, and there isn’t one. As you roam these tiny expanses, you won’t witness interesting random events, rare spawns or other points of interest spawning at any point. The best you’ll get are goblin traders that you can shelter and house in your base, or animals to kill or capture and breed. The interest wanes after only a couple of hours, as you’ll have seen everything by then.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960459835

[h3]Combat System[/h3]
At night, monsters will spawn on any non-player made tile. The inside of your (hopefully) walled base is safe, but outside the hordes are relentless. Enemies vary per biome: for instance the ice biome will have evil snowmen, the underground caves have explosive spiders, and the enchanted dimension have floating, energy-shooting abominations. The way to defeat each foe  is always the same: kite them in a circle and keep slashing in melee, or wait between shooting patterns for ranged enemies. All of them have one attack pattern and follow mostly the same archetype, with minimal variations.

Your choice of weapons is limited to swords, throwing spears or, if you grind trader reputation enough, slings. Each of them has a single attack, with the sling capable of flinging various crystals and bombs as an exception. Enemies become repetitive and stale not after long, while the combat system simply doesn’t have the depth to keep being engaging. No armors, accessories, upgrades, unique weapons and so on are present at any point. Blocking? Parry? Dodge? Anything? Nah, forget it. Minecraft’s combat system is Dark Souls in comparison to Miniland Adventures.

[h3]Crafting & Base Building[/h3]
You’ll use four main workbenches to get anything done, from flooring to utility buildings, weapons and furniture. The crafting system is the typical one of any open-world survival, requiring you to have a certain amount of basic and processed materials to make a finished product. 

There’s no further elaboration or novelty to it. The economy is kinda broken, to the point I never used anything else than stone tools and Ruby (like Minecraft’s diamond) swords, as metal tools lasted too short compared to the effort to grind the materials to make new ones. Expect to take some time to have a spacious base with all the bells and whistles, even if most craftables are purely decorative or gimmicky - you won’t need them, unless you want to upgrade trader reputation by placing them in their rooms, which isn’t worth it anyway.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960460780

[h3]Trading & Farming[/h3]
Traders offer wares locked behind reputation tiers, gained by furnishing their rooms in specific ways. Some of these items can’t be obtained in any other way, however none of them is really worth the effort. The system exists and is even a decent concept, but has no incentive to be used. 

Farming works in a classic way: plant crops, water them daily or use an automated sprinkler, reap the fully-grown produce and repeat. Of course, some plants may only grow in certain soils or biomes, while animals won’t need care but eat specific vegetables to breed and have more to harvest, like sheep for wool to make an example.",0.0

202,136559848.0,1949030,"This year has been a great period for horror game remakes between Dead Space and RE4, and now even Frogwares seems to be getting on board that train. If you aren't familiar with the older games in this series (like the one this is a remake of), you should know that despite this sharing a lot of the DNA of Chapter One, it isn't an open world game. There are a few small hub areas with occasional small diversions, and if you get the side quest dlc there's some side stuff to do throughout the first half of the game, but for the most part it's more like a traditional point-and-click adventure game campaign (which I consider a substantial plus, considering how poorly their attempts at open world games went). It's adjusted to be less inventory focused in favor of more of the modern investigation gameplay, but the main campaign is essentially one big ""case"", and it took me around 11 hours to get through everything. 

Its adherence to the original material comes as a slight detriment in some parts, because the pacing around the middle of the game was kind of a mess back then and to some extent it still is here, but a lot has been done to tidy things up and smooth over the rough edges. The writing is all around improved, the tone is more consistent across the board, and the story and puzzles have been changed up for the better. And compared to Chapter One, it's honestly just really nice to have Watson back again; I went into their previous game with an open mind towards Jon, but he just didn't have half the chemistry that these two have. There aren't any of Chapter One's unsolvable ""no right answer"" choices, and you never have to gun down a room full of enemies! It's just a fun game all around for mystery fans, and while it's not enough that I don't still miss the Crimes & Punishments style of gameplay and deduction, it's a level of compromise I'm happy to work with.

The original Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened was always a fairly substantial departure from what was normal for this series, injecting all sorts of horror and mysticism into the otherwise fairly grounded universe and then daring you to call it non-canon by bolting itself to the timeline with a single key plot element. I thought for sure that this would end up being more of a reimagining than a remake as a result, with it seeming to position itself as an official sequel to Chapter One, but it doesn't -- if anything, it gets even weirder at some moments, and I wouldn't have it any other way.",1.0
203,136559763.0,1949030,"No, it's still not on the level of Crimes and Punishments. It appears Frogwares just doesnt effin get it. We want the games to be more like C&P NOT what came after it. The design mistakes of The Sinking City and Chapter One are still present though they seemed to have realized the eavesdropping and combat sucked so they have been removed. Once again, you are asked to make choices on guesswork since they could really go either way, things will not be visible because you werent on the right viewmode or were not highlighting the the right clue. Yes, the silly pinning mechanic is still here, and the game wants to be a sequel to Chapter One, constantly referencing it. Chapter One was a mistake that should be forgotten, not referenced multiple times within the first minutes. You already have a foundation to build on, it's called Crimes and Punishments. The mind map has been simplified yet again, and in a more frustrating way that tells you what kind of clues to select and how many, in a much less intuitive or interesting way than select posibilities enabling a logic train of thought like the one in C&P and TDD. The new Mind Map is also ripe for frustration and bruteforcing as you will frequently know what the answer is, just not what evidence it wants as the chain of thought that leads to it (a common problem of detective games), or you know onlt the logic train to an answer and it comes out of Sherlock's ass since the player could not have pieced the finan deduction from the clues. I'm supposed to BE Sherlock, not WATCH and nudge Sherlock. This is not a Watson game.
Also, in that respect, the Imagination mechanic still solves the whole thing for you. You play a game of ordering very vague but still chronologically simple to follow events, but then Sherlock fills in all the blanks sometimes with plenty of information you didnt glean at all or couldnt be sure of. The character does the detective work instead of the player who gets to play a minigame and watch. Yaaaay.
 And once again, side cases either dont get a mind map at all or get an even more simplified one.
Oh, and in a cruel twist of UX, the archive is now accesed by looking at clues. I bet many returning players will try to access it by frantically pacing around the two inches of 221B you can move through repeatedly befroe realizing that. I'm beginning to think the game lacked playtesting.
I'll probably finish it as I'm out of other games but if you were hoping for a return to form, sorry, no. It seems whomever is in charge now plain and simply doesnt get the appeal of the best detective game they made, and has no interest in building on it. They like what I consider to be their worse games too much and will continue on the path they laid foward in them. Shame. Chapter One was a mistake and they are happy to keep making it. Fire whomever is in charge of CO and this pseudo remake and get the people in charge of C&P back on board for the next one.
P.S: Credit where credit is due, the game is really well optimized and while the animations are lacking, the character models for Sherlock and John are great.",0.0
204,136560732.0,2060670,"It starts off promising enough, but having played the full release, I just don't know why you would play this over almost any other competent release in the new genre.

The graphics are neat, and there are a lot of interesting things presented - talents on level up that unlock a new set of talents, choosing your starting basic weapon, the watering thing is neat and the building stuff seems interesting. The problem is, you don't get to interact with it at all. You choose from 4 options on level up, and that includes ""potions"" which are basically temporary buffs. The pool of talents is MASSIVE, and not weighted (as far as I can see). You get 2 rerolls per floor, which amounts to about 8 rerolls per run, which is basically useless for actually trying to do ""a build"". If you choose one of those ""class"" talents that unlock more options (mechanic, ki, etc.) it gets even worse.

Basically all the choices are worthless because, like all these genre of games, you need synergy and multiplicative power to survive, which means just take the most basic, passive stat upgrades, and the basic fish summon skills, and do the same thing every run because everything else requires a staggering amount of luck in your favor to see work. 

You can experiment on the lowest tier difficulty a bit but even then you'll often just run into not killing stuff fast enough which means less xp which means less leveling which means killing stuff slower which means spending 5 minutes after the end of the level timer dodging endlessly while you whittle away the hp of the boss (or you could go onward and forsake even more xp). Oh also you obviously get WAY less rewards at the basic tier. Also unlocking higher tiers requires beating the previous tier, which means doing incrementally less forgiving runs over and over using the same builds over and over because anything else could mean wasting 15-20 minutes of your time and not knowing it until the choices keep failing to happen.

There is a fun game hidden here behind the insane lack of meaningful choices presented to the player.

If you're interested at all, definitely pick this up. It's worth it, and it helps support and encourage the developer while they work on the sequel(s) already underway to continue the story (and shows Disney that good Tron content is worth investing in).

229,136518027.0,2151770,"Fun action roguelike with unique art and interesting gameplay. It starts a bit slow, but gets a lot better once you grab a few perks.

The main gameplay is typical for the genre. You advance through randomly created floors, defeat enemies, gather coins to spend on better goods in shops, and open boxes with perks. Everything is lost upon death, with the exception of special keys and stat improvements.

The unique mechanic is the blue and yellow energy. Numerous things are connected to each energy, and you can change at will. Examples include opponents that can only be wounded with the appropriate energy and chests that open only with the matching color. 

Additionally, some weapons and perks are energy-specific; they simply don’t work if you have the opposite energy. Fortunately, most enemies are in neutral energy, so you won't have to continually switch during combat.

Three keys are unique to each floor and are hidden in unique puzzle areas. These challenges disable your ability to switch between energies but give you doors that, after you pass through them, switch between the two colors. The goal is to push boxes and use doors to reach the final room with the key. 

You keep these keys forever because they let you open unique chests that make subsequent runs a little bit simpler. But the most important is the puzzle room that gives you coins at the beginning of each run.

The reason you want to do that is that items are pricey. It's nearly impossible to purchase anything just by eliminating enemies that randomly drop a chest of coins once you finish clearing out a room. While your starting gun has unlimited ammo, the short range and fun factor just isn’t there because you simply can’t afford a better gun at the start. 

The game's subject is time travel and experiments, therefore each ""floor"" is set in a different time period. Most enemies show up in all the stages, but there are still enough distinct ones to keep the game interesting. Four floors might not see much, but there’s enough content here to keep you busy for a while. A nice addition is a library that gets filled with all the weapons, enemies and perks you encounter.",1.0

Pro:
1- Game looks nice and runs smooth (for me).
2. Good concept but could be lacking longevity or replayability.
3. 3 different mines on the map and map is large although a lot of wasted space

Cons:
1. A lot of the controls are not really explained clear enough- especially when it comes to assigning haulers to diggers. Make sure you assign the hauler first then the digger or you will waste a ton of resources.
2. When it comes to the second and third mine- to load the cargo onto the barge or train- make sure you hit the Q and E key to open and close the scoops. Also was not clear.
3- The drill rig was also very confusing at first- but the arms can rotate outwards much further than it appears. You just have to keep moving them in a circle format to fully extend them. Might be easier on controller but on keyboard it was a chore.
 4. My biggest complaint and an issue I might be overlooking:

Workers do not seem to continue to work if you are not in the mines. At least it seems that way to me. So not much reason to have all 3 mines working. As there is no fast travel and it takes for ever to travel between mines- I think I am going to sell all the machines at the first mine and just concentrate on either the 2nd or 3rd mine. Someone could clarify if I am missing something here.

************************************

I was one of the games playtesters and was fortunate to see the game grow over its development cycle. I have completed the game several times, and currently working through a play through of the release version. Even though my current hours on the release build are low, I am writing with the benefit of knowing what is coming from playing it first hand during tests.

Rusted Moss takes the standard metroidvania with double jumps and replaces it with a challenging but extremely satisfying grappling hook. Some people might find the grapple a challenge at first, but I found as I played more I was able to improve my skill quickly. And once you do.... wow this game really opens up. The satisfaction of landing a sick grappling sequence, or ""breaking"" the game in ways that while intended, allow for a high level of creativity in how you approach the game. Once the game 'clicks', you feel like Spider-Man swinging around as he pleases. The game also has optional climb challenges for those who stray off the beaten path that push the limits of the grappling hook even further. The grapple challenges alone would have justified my purchase as they are extremely fun and allow you to attempt to improve your time, pushing you to be better and better. However, the grapple isn't the only element of the game, and to ignore the other elements would be a mistake as they are also excellent.

The gunplay is tight and satisfying, and playing with mouse and keyboard allows for precise aiming giving me a sense of complete control of my character. When I make a mistake I know it was an execution issue on my end, not a cheap trick from the game. Save points are abundant, which allows you to experiment and go for challenges that otherwise might have seemed too risky. Boss fights have always been the thing I look forward to the most in metroidvanias and Rusted Moss does not disappoint on this front.  I especially love when the grappling hook is integrated into the fight itself as it adds a new element that I have not experienced before this.

The story is an interesting take with morally ambiguous characters, fighting for their lives in a war between the Fae and Humans. With talk of prophecies, secrets, traitors, and double agents, I was fully invested into the story and wanted to progress to find out what would happen next. The music of the game adds to the atmosphere beautifully, immersing me further and further into the game. Going from making me feel transported into the world, to being hyped during a boss fight, or even scared and uneasy in an optional zone that become my instant favourite.

If you are a fan of the metroidvania genre, Rusted Moss is a fresh take with a lot of fun challenges and upgrades to explore. I highly recommend the game, especially to those who ‘click’ with the grappling hook as it opens up the world in a way that I found exciting.",1.0

Now that I've finally played through it (just once so far, though I'm planning on replaying it to make different decisions), I find myself pleasantly surprised. The best Tron game I'd played before this one was either Tron 2.0 or Tron Evolution. I think this one is a lot more interesting than either of those, frankly. It's short, with my first playthrough clocking in around 2 hours, but there's definitely incentive to replay multiple times, as there are several decisions that affect the fates of characters and the roles they play in the story. And at $15, it's hard to be mad about a short runtime.

I really enjoyed the writing and the story here. I think this is the most existential and even political that Tron has ever been, and as a fan of the franchise, it's exciting to see a title that feels eager to dive deeper into the pre-established ideas and see what makes them tick.

This is the first piece of TRON lore that we have received in ten years!!! This is a great visual novel for players who love the genre, love TRON, or both. I'm still going through the game, but with my first play-through, I can tell that the writers took a lot of care and effort into recognizing and expanding on the intricate details of the TRON universe. 

However, the story is shorter than I would have wanted it to be. If you're a fast reader like I am, your play-through should take you 1-2 hours. Wish there was more to unlock and read. The $15 price does not justify this short length. 

Hopefully this is the only the tip of the iceberg for us to receive more TRON content. With the recent opening of the TRON Lightcycle / Run roller coaster at Walt Disney World and a third movie on the horizon, this is (hopefully) just the beginning.

HD version still proccesing!

This new visual novel is more of a romance story that is heavily focused on the stories of the characters present in it and I guess it tries to get the player invested in them too but, personally, I found it boring because from the start of the game all the dialogue was about your 3 friends and their inside jokes that I don't care much about (because there was no build-up to it, just loads of info about characters that I'm not invested in yet). Too much useless information and back-story all at once in the beginning (just my opinion). Other than that the characters look good and detailed, the story don't seem so far-fetched as it is in other visual novels, there are some animations and a lot of images. The price is kinda spicy but it seems that the devs want to release more episodes in the future at no extra charge.",1.0

Furthermore, I think there should be more settings, like the ability to change from downscroll to upscroll, as well as change the scroll speed like in normal rhythm games. It is also quite complex to learn the controls since you need to switch between different attacks while hitting different notes. I believe there should only be light attacks, heavy attacks, and blocks otherwise the gameplay would be too complicated since you would need to fight your opponent while hitting your notes with your other hand. Additionally, the mapping appears out of sync, especially in Vertigo. In order to preserve the true feeling of a singing competition between two great musicians, I believe more hard and upbeat songs should be added. I also find it strange that two people would be fighting while singing, but since that's the point of the game, I think it's fine. Moreover, I believe that different game modes, such as 4K, 7K, 9K, etc., should be added. As a conclusion, I think that hard charts and different genres of music should be added to keep the game from becoming boring and bland, and that more content should be added to allow players to discover what they're good at.

275,136551362.0,1118110,"This game is really good but needs more to do. I have been playing for no more than 4 hours or so and I have nearly collected all achievements, after that is complete I will probably lose interest in this game quite quickly with the lack of content.

THE MAP:
The map is massive with nothing on it but roads. The world is basically just long roads leading to each mine with nothing in between. The garage/petrol station is a good idea but I didn't fill up the car once after the tutorial bit at the very start.

SOUNDS:
The sounds on this are just very bad...I muted my game when playing.

MINES:
All three mines are basically the same with nothing added to them (just a bigger area to walk across to sell coal). So this means that buying the other mines is a waste of time (you only have to buy them to get the achievement). 

WORKERS:
The workers don't actually work. 

MISSIONS:
At one point in the game the mission says "" Now you can build your coal empire"" and it basically stays the same no matter how much you earn, you can't advance any further than this. 

DISASTERS AND VEHICLE DAMAGE:
I am yet to see any disasters in the game which is indicated in the trailer, and no damage at all to vehicles (so it was pointless picking up the tool kit other than to fit that wheel at the start.....which you never have to do again.). If disasters and explosions actually happened I could maybe avoid that happening if I could actually buy a gas detector (The key command is in the menu but you cant buy one) and phones for the mines isn't working either which is also stated in the description. 

FINAL THOUGHT ON THE GAME:
I was going to pay way over the £11 asking price for this as I was looking forward to it....Highly disappointed, really hope the developers have more to add as I believe this game could have been great.",0.0

The game is tough and your deck needs to have solutions for every situation, deckbuilding is much more complicated than just filling your deck up with matching keywords/synergies and winning the run on sheer power. It's worth noting that all of the battles in each run are interesting rather than the ""filler"" battles which many similar games feature.

Finally the theme/artwork are top notch and there is plenty of content to unlock to give the game some longevity!

298,136577403.0,1685730,"The game has a pleasing aesthetic and atmosphere to it. The journey takes us from colorful, vibrant landscapes, into medieval dungeons and murky swamps, which presents a welcome change of scenery and mood for each chapter.

The soundtrack is well done, each chapter has its own theme that fits the level and surrounding area, and the audio queues for being close to enemies or being spotted add some tension to the stealth gameplay.

The puzzles are well integrated into the levels, they're not too easy but also not very difficult, which makes it a chill experience while still offering a bit of a challenge. 

The stealth segments of the game have a good pacing to them, the levels aren't just extended sneaking sections, but a healthy combination of stealth and exploration with some puzzles thrown into the mix for some variety in gameplay.

I played with mouse and keyboard. The game is also compatible with controllers and joysticks. All controls can be remapped to your liking.

The game isn't very long. You can probably finish it in about 2 hours. I messed around a bit which lead to me spending close to 4 hours in the game. However, the game being short is definitely not a negative in this case. I think that overall the chill atmosphere and semi-challenging gameplay makes for a cozy experience on a rainy afternoon.

The game has some bugs in it, which is to be expected from a new release, especially one made by one developer and one 3D artist. Some of them have already been fixed in the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1685730/view/3719451786611878892] 1.0.1 hotfix [/url] that was released within a day of the launch.
Most of those bugs are and were extremely minor nuisances but nothing really game breaking. Most could be fixed by simply reloading the latest checkpoint, which the game has a good amount of, so you don't really lose much progress.

Cynthia comes across various collectibles throughout her journey, which offers some replayability should you have missed some. The ability to select and replay levels after completing the story would be a welcome addition, since there is no way to go back to get a collectible you might have missed other than starting a new game, which deletes your previous save.


What I didn't like as much was the dissonance between the character models. Cynthia, as the player character, has great quality model with physics and a neat selection of cool outfits to collect along her adventure. However, the other NPCs, while not looking too bad, are of noticeably lower quality than Cynthia. It makes sense to have the player be more refined than the NPCs we don't see as often and up-close too much, but it is still a bit jarring during cutscenes to go from Cynthia to an NPC.

The final boss fight was underwhelming and over before I knew it, I was hoping for a bit of a more elaborate final battle.
It sadly felt a bit rushed.

This one in particular seems to allow an absurd amount of customization in the way you link your weapons. It's really hard to explain in text and something that comes across better by just trying it out! Based on how you set up your links, your new upgrades can affect yourself, your enemies, your other weapons, or for example, your other weapons that proc off of hitting your other enemies, and so on and so forth (like an example - you can have a sword swinging from yourself, that inflicts poison on an enemy, that releases a nova burst every second, that inflicts a burn on enemies, which triggers something else to happen when it blows up, and so on).

I'm really not know all about Deck building game so I can't pointing out on if this is a good game for that genre or not. But I can given you a detail on what you'll get on this game.

- Deck building game: Everything is card, Including you and you companions.
- On your journey you can pick a cards  to assisting in your journey, So don't worry, You'll have a lot of cards.
- Which also mean you have to building your own deck. The card consisted of Weapons, Companions and Equipments. Playing each card will subtracting a turn on both you and the enemies. Any card hit zero first get to hit first.
- So its basically a game of wits where you'll have to manage the card you'll play before your team gets to hit  the enemies turn by turn. And trust me, Its not that easy at all. and you are going to losing alot.......This is where Rouge lite elements come into play.

1. At the beginning of each match, You'll get to pick 1 out of 3 randomize heroes.  Each will have different hit point and Health point. Also some of them will come pack with the effect such as Barrage (Hit all enemies in the same row) etc. etc.

2. You'l die. ALOT. Which if you are able to complete certain objective on each match. You'll progressively unlocking the building on your starting point. Allow for better equipment, companion and pets (And more)

So basically, This game is best because you can swooshing in and out for a quick rush and just leave when you thing just gone down hill and coming back later for better tryout. Its really fun especially when you just want to have something casual and still feeling serious at same time.

I played about 150 hours in the standalone years ago. I decided that I should start playing again because now it's on Steam. They have done so many quality of life improvements that you new players can enjoy. The bullcrap system with the ""mobile game"" like daily where you send your operators to collect stuff is gone. There used to be so many currencies you had to grind and now the only basic silver & fragments is enough with the premium currency. Grinding operators to get better before was insanely boring, tedious and annoying. Now it's simple and much better. Straight line and you just spend the free to play currency to activate new talents. 

Graphics are good and so are about 80% of the legendary operator skins. There are few goofed up stuff but rest are some old school gear and then some tactic00l af stuff. Pick the operator you like, read what their skills do and enjoy. Store updates weekly that which operators are on discount. 

To all new players, please play the tutorial. I play medic 90% of the time so please, don't run away from me. If you need the heals, go to the medic or stay near the player and if the skill requires a chain or AoE don't leave it. Don't spend your syringes that much since medic can carry 6, save your one syringe when it all hits the fan. 

I never liked the PvP and never gonna play it. I just love to grind the simple PvE maps and modes. 

It's not perfect though, the new voice acting in some maps that are totally redone with ""story"" cutscenes etc. is so abysmal that you may want to mute your dialogs. It is just disgustingly bad. Some random voice actor doing stereotypically bad accents. Should have just stayed with the vanilla voices like in the old maps. There are also some really meta operators for PvE which are just hilariously OP and can carry the whole match. Bourbon is disgustingly OP as hell with Kit. 

It is a good free to play game and it is improving more and more. Glad they improved so many quality of life aspects needed in the game, the previous currency grind made me quit but now I can just casually play again and progress.",1.0

After playing this game for a long time, and having a peak in Super Test environment I can tell you, honestly that this team isn't competent  and they blatantly lie. For example this year was supposed to be without any new units, however, they need money again so they're adding two more. They increased the price of everything, just to milk people dry.
Their battlepasses were around 40 to 60 euros depending if you want to complete it fully, and the mod team would make fun of COD for having 10 dollar BPs that were cosmetic, while Caliber had literal pay to win collections for over 30 euros..

I was once harrassed and DDOSED by the people i played against, provided literal video footage, however ScumbagJuJu who is the lead moderator, shut me up and never said anything to the russian players that literally attacked me verbally and my hardware.
Another instance was where i was unrighfully banned by a moderator, where he promised a certain channel, then acted dumb and demanded i prove it or he will mute me for a certain amount of time, when i did prove it with a screenshot i asked him does he need more proof or will he stop  eating shit, which he promptly muted. Of course he was scolded by ScmubagJuJu because he was in no right to do so, yet he did. 

The player feedback isn't listen to, believe me, for four years we put up with their lack of balance and bullshit updates to avoid doing anything. They release a new unit, make it broken, literally pay to win, milk them for a few months and then somewhat nerf them.

I've played every game mode, I have a decent amount of earned premium skins and all opeartors [besides the new pay to win americans and chinese] a lot of time spent in game as well. 
Their rules are so bad, you can get banned, now let me repeat, you can loose your account, for Tbagging an enemy and or friendly. That was also one of the questions i was asked when they asked me for super testing "" How would i feel if someone tbagged me"" where i answered i'd find it funny, cuz it's all in good faith and gaming fun.

THIS IS NOT YOUR REGULAR FPS SHOOTER  !!! 

A very Story Driven Game , Story is pretty solid 

There is actually 2 Endings to it so you can say you have to make a choice at somepoint 

Very Unique Game modes where you fight in 1 vs 1 against CPU in various levels 

Not very long game , I d say it will take like 4 Hrs to finish both the endings 

Overall fun and unique 

Price is also very fair

One of the standout features for me was the ability to choose from a variety of classes to create a diverse and dynamic party. It added an element of strategy and allowed me to approach battles in different ways.

Another standout feature was the warcamp, which was a unique and useful addition. It allowed me to manage resources, recruit new members, and interact with NPCs in a way that felt organic and immersive. I appreciated the option to choose between playing as a lawful character or embracing a more criminal lifestyle, which added a layer of moral complexity to the game.

344,136576847.0,1527950,"I'm really on the fence about this game. When I got it as the very early and incomplete version, it was awesome, arguably the best ""tactical RPG"" I know, even devoid of many features. But, as the versions progressed and the changes were made, it became worse. Today, probably hours away from release, it's... just another tRPG, I guess. With a couple interesting ideas and a number of annoying problems, just like most games.

The changes themselves are quite subtle. (sorry for long explanations, it's fairly intuitive when you actually play).
As an example, there is a very nice implementation of turn order: both your and your opponents' men are ""distributed evenly"" in the turn order for the round, so if the number of combatants is equal, you and enemy take turns acting with a single fighter, until all fighters act. However, for the AI, the order of its units acting is fixed, while you can act with any of your guys (who didn't act in this turn yet). While ""unfair"" towards the AI, it provides many interesting choices and tactics.
Now, if the enemy has twice as many people as you do, for each of your actions, they make two. So, even if you kill (or otherwise deal with) the guy who acts next (the obvious choice), another enemy will act after that and probably you'll be in some trouble. So, the difference in numbers turns out to be very, very important.
What did they change? Now, the number of your enemies is always quite close to yours, and in cases it somehow isn't, the extra units will arrive later (when you already killed many enemies) as reinforcements. So, the (rightfully dreaded) experience of being outnumbered is cut off from the game. Now, a lot of battles follow the same pattern: you neutralize the enemy who acts next, then he doesn't do much (or anything at all, if killed), rinse, repeat. A hundred of perfectly forgettable battles. 

I could write several such examples, including camp management, economy, fog mechanics. The early versions did convey the right experiences: you struggled to stay afloat with money, thoughtfully picked your contracts, took care of your men. But the updates made the game progressively worse. My best guess is, the game designers knew what they are doing and made bold (and really good!) decisions, but then some salespeople took over the game and made it ""accessible for wider audience"" or something - just another game.

UPD. The release actually happened while I was writing this. Congratulations! Despite all I wrote above, kudos for actually going all the way to the finished game, I know it's hard work.",0.0

The developers are doing an excellent job of listening to the community and continually adding new content, which is very impressive. However, I have noticed lack of optimization issues with Nvidia, causing the game to stutter for few secs during your turn in combat.

There's so much going on in this game that I keep dumping long hours into it. Yeah, it's definitely not a fast paced game that everyone is going to enjoy. Some of the fights I've run into more early on in the game have taken long periods of time both in setup/strategy and because of the turn-based nature of the game. It'll take a couple of tries to get things right starting out and it's pretty easy to lose companions if you're not paying attention to everything that's going on.
Micromanaging your wages, food and companions' relationships is challenging and rewarding, making the overall hardcore feeling of the game much more appealing for players like me. Screw up positioning and lose your favorite archer, maybe save scum a few times to try finding a better starting position. There's a lot to soak up when you first start and there's definitely a bit of a learning curve, which makes it more entertaining and challenging.

Cannot wait to see where the game ends up going from here. Really enjoying what's there and I've only unlocked one other region so far, so there's plenty of stuff for me yet to do. I've tried a few groups so far and end up going back to the first one I created where I'm the furthest and in a definite money problem (though, I always forget to grab some prisoners - which is a pretty decent way to fund everything), sometimes a food issue, but my troop is getting stronger every time I sit down to rampantly play.",1.0

The fact that there is no initiative and any character can move when it's your turn (and vice versa for the enemy) feels silly. The starting positions in most fights also don't make a ton of sense to me. The talent trees are too shallow and it feels like some classes are much stronger than others. 

The 'campaign'/story is nice, but the battles become repetitive fairly quickly. I stopped playing sometime during the third region and haven't felt like picking it up again.

371,130149997.0,1527950,"The basic premise of the game is that you control a changing party of mercenaries and seek your fortune in a low-fantasy open world. As this is essentially the same premise as Battle Brothers, which I'm very familiar with, I'm going to compare the two in my review. I think a lot of people who will be interested in this newer game (still EA) will have already tried Battle Brothers, so such a comparison may be helpful to them.

Compared to BB, this game has a much greater sense of REALISM; every experience is more immersive. Instead of moving your party's icon across the map, you will see your group of members, complete with their beast(s) of burden and wagon(s), walking across the world itself. There are lots of points of interest in the world for you to interact with, including resource deposits to collect, groups of travelers of different factions, towns to visit, tombs to explore, etc. Most locations allow for you to search for things, sort of like a hidden object game. When you enter a town, there are multiple locations to visit, but they're a bit more involved than simply a menu with a list of options. Sometimes there are puzzles or quests involving multiple people, and in many cases you'll have to choose which faction to side with. Rather than hiring non-combat followers like BB, each of your companions can choose a profession which is very useful for the party as a whole; for example, you can designate someone to be a cook, which will enable them to cook recipes from food ingredients, and someone else to be a miner, allowing them to extract ore from mines. Most professions are associated with a mini-game; an angler has a little game in which you try to keep a fish on the line. The crafting system involves gathering resources from many sources: from town shops, from travelling merchants, from harvesting natural deposits, from skinning defeated animals; and then unlocking recipes that can be completed in your camp or in a dedicated workshop. The sheer number of things to do, and the way they all connect and benefit your team - it's a very impressive system. In terms of the fantasy element: if BB is a ""low"" fantasy world, this seems to be a ""lower"" fantasy world. If there is any sort of magic (beyond certain alchemy potions) or fantastic creatures (beyond a humongous rat) in this game, I have not discovered it yet.

GRAPHICALLY, the game outshines BB in every way. All people have full 3D models; all movements, battle skills, etc. are fully animated, and they're done so very well. I'm not knocking Battle Brothers here at all; it simply focuses on gameplay and doesn't endeavor to do a whole lot graphically, and people who enjoy it aren't looking to be wowed with graphics. That said, this game does, and uses the graphics for full immersion in a very impressive way.

The COMBAT is comparable to Battle Brothers, each having strengths and weaknesses. One of my favorite things about both games is that everybody can die. For real. For good. If you suck and let one of your guys die, they're dead. Gone. Bye bye. When I said your party is *changing*, that's what I meant: if you bite off more than you can chew, they'll be pushing up daisies in no time, and you'll have to recruit replacements. That said, combat in this game is *slightly* more forgiving, in that there's a mechanic applied to all your characters that essentially gives them the ""nine-lives"" perk from BB; that is, if they would be killed by a blow the first time, they survive it for a moment but will die for real if they take any more damage before they are healed. ""Healed"", meaning a realistic first aid skill that doesn't magically put them back to full health - it stops bleeding, burning, etc., and gives them a few hitpoints. A major difference between this game and BB is that battles are affected very little by RNG rolls; it rarely determines whether attacks hit or miss. (It does affect the order that enemies take their turns, as well as damage output for most skills.) Another major difference is that the tactical maps are not hex-based; they are based on realistic distances. Characters, depending on their movement ability, may be able to move up to, say, 10 meters. Positioning is very important, as different skills and weapons have different ranges (in meters). There are also natural hazards for certain tactical maps, such as falling rocks in caves, or lightning strikes during storms. (I actually find that these detract from the realism a bit, however, for two reasons: #1 in real life, they don't happen often enough to be a real factor in any battle of this size; #2, you get a preview of the AoE for these hazards before the turn, so you know exactly where and when they will occur, and you have plenty of time to get your guys out of the way.) In all, the combat feels very good in this game. I'm delighted to tell you that I screwed the pooch about 20 times before I finally figured out how to keep my guys alive.

Your COMPANIONS can be recruited from inns, from prisons, or other sources, such as solving a dilemma a certain way or completing a quest. You can also take prisoners and force them to do your bidding, including even taming most animals in the game and having them fight for you. Unlike BB, they have classes rather than backgrounds; the classes determine what options are available when they level up, so the customization doesn't feel quite as flexible as BB. You cannot equip any armor/weapon on any class. Only an Archer can use a bow, and he/she can't use anything else (that I'm aware of); in the event that they are forced into a melee attack, they can only use their fist to punch for a couple points' damage. The Ranger class is essentially a ""rogue"" from most RPG-type games. They can only wield a knife and an option off-hand weapon. I'm not sure why he's called a ""ranger"", as his primary weapon is not ranged and he doesn't really have any connection to nature or animals. As far as the uniqueness of characters' appearance, there are about 5 faces, 5 hairstyles, 5 beards, 5 hair colors, etc that you can choose from. So you can customize... just not a lot. However, companions can be either male or female, though I'm not sure of the full implications of this, or if it's simply an aesthetic choice. As you progress through the game, events can happen (like in BB) where characters acquire new traits or even promotions. When you hire someone, you don't know how exactly they will end up a month down the road.

PROCEDURAL GENERATION: This is the main area where BB triumphs over Wartales, as it has a fully generated, randomized world for each game. This is the main reason why I have over 4000 hours in it: it's hugely replayable. In comparison, the world of Wartales and most things in it were manually designed. RNG does affect some things from game to game, such as which items are available for sale at different locations, where/when some resources will appear, who will be travelling where and when, the order that quests will appear, etc. However, the world is otherwise a map of the same area from game to game. You can re-play the game with different characters, strategies, skills, and whatnot, and you can unlock different starting areas as you progress through the game; however, you will still be playing the same world, and you'll know all locations, stories, main quests, and decisions ahead of time, provided that you've discovered them before in an earlier playthrough. In my opinion, this is the only real drawback to this game compared with BB; but for me, it's a major one.

That said, this is a very fun, high-quality game with a ton of stuff to see and do and try out. What the developers set out to do, they have achieved remarkably. And it's still only Early Access - you can bet it's only going to get better as they continue to add more of the same.",1.0

Ware tales however is just difficult. Don't get me wrong, i enjoy a game that seriously stresses my mind. I wait with anticipation for Frostpunk 2. However when a game artificially makes its setting difficult for the sake of being difficult, no thanks...
Number of points.
1 Game economics are terrible. You can tell the economic capability of a game like this based of the craft cost. A crafted item should generally be worth more than the base components that went into it. This can vary if there is a price change due to quantity in a market (not for Wartales). When i went over the general prices for many crafted items, about 1/3 to 1/2 are just straight out less cost effective than their base components. This is disheartening to see at the start of a game. I didn't even factor in the general cost of acquiring the items in terms of party upkeep. You can grind the game out and make progress with the system possibly. That was just a massive red flag for me right away.
2 Combat is completely unbalanced. I know, people with tell me that it was fine for them, just use strategy, or if you do it this certain way than its just fine. A game like this should reward you for thinking tactically, not demand it. I don't enjoy spending an abundant amount of time strategizing on each tedious fight. Also if you are fighting same level enemies as you, the general expectation is that their capabilities will be the same. If the enemy can do double my damage at the same level and class, that's an artificial difficulty adjustment for the sake of being difficult. I don't enjoy it, and i don't enjoy being given paltry rewards for it. At least one wound at least per encounter for me, costing me at least 20 in craft good cost for a medicine, reward worth about 15 or 20. Just disappointing after the effort.
3 The story is lost in the survival. Any semblance of story that you might come across gets lost in the desperation to simply survive. You will make decisions based on your current needs more than on your morals at the start. Maybe this is the tale they are trying to convey. That life looses meaning when you stop living and just survive. Well they are right and that, in the end, is why i didn't exactly enjoy this game. I play games to live, not simply survive.",0.0

399,119492306.0,1527950,"This game is AMAZING. It's a Early Access game yet, but for anyone that enjoys slow paced mercenary group kind of game (yes, if you like Battle Brothers you'll probably love this) this is a GEM. 

60 hours into it and have only fully explored 2 of the 4 (5?) regions available until now, the other 2 are almost untouched, yes I'm taking my time to explore and grow my group but still, that's a lot of content and things to do in a EA game. I'll probably take another 60hours to finish all the content currently avaiable and wait anxiously for more. 

The combat is very in-depth and even in Normal it's a welcome challenge, a lot of factors to take into account because each and every encounter is different, different mini-bosses, deployment and so on. Every single fight I have to think about what I'm doing, if I rush in head on even on lower level encounter I can get a guy killed. 

There is a lot of skills and especializations in the game, each of them bring something new to the table and makes you adapt to each situation depending on the guys you have. Nice crafting system, altough the weapons and armours you can craft gets pretty old when you reach lvl 6 and start dropping higher level stuff. They are still very much useful nonetheless. 

The only complain I have is the pathing system in the world map, you get stuck a lot but it's ok. I wasn't expecting to be so hooked up on the game since is EA, but the devs made an awesome game so far. It's well worth the price if you ask me, ESPECIALLY because the devs are apparently keeping up with the roadmap with almost no delays. I wholeheartedly recommend this game, in a era of awful and shallow AAA games as well as a flood of indie companies doing mini games to stay afloat, Wartales is gigantic breath of fresh air!

Wartales is a turn-based combat (XCom style) squad RPG, with a solid amount of content, interesting storylines, fun and challenging gameplay.  Unfortunately, there are still several bugs that range from mildly annoying to game-breaking.  By far the worst (at least on my system) is the chance to crash the entire computer upon entering any town marketplace (happens about 25% of the time), which also often corrupts both the auto-save and manual saves from that game.  I have one campaign 15 hours in, but due to that crash and save corruption, I can no longer play it.  Incredibly frustrating.

437,109836280.0,1527950,"Hm...  42hrs in my first playthru.  

42hrs in the first area alone.  
I felt like with the EA, I hit the limit with my team too quickly.  Got the hang of the whole, fight, run home, repair, eat, fight, run home, repair, eat, etc. fairly quickly.

As ambitious the concept of Wartales sounds like, I couldn't really feel emotionally attached to my team/character as I would in games like Kenshi, Mount & Blade, Crusader Kings, etc.  I didn't really feel attached to the mini-stories around the area as well.  I was excited to play the story of farmers wanting more with life but once I started playing, it felt like your backstory has nothing to do with how you play or how it dictates the world.  A game title like ""Wartales"" feels like a ""Play the way you want to with the backstory you want"" type game.  But this is just purely, fight, loot, repair, eat, sleep, repeat.

Oh, uhm.. once I figured out how to effectively and efficiently craft items for trade, it added an additional 10hrs of gameplay of renewed excitement realizing I could make more money by crafting from random loot and selling the crafted items. But then I hit my limit again once I managed to consistently stay over 1000 gold or so.

After all that and completing the first area and moving to the second, I felt like I hit a wall to play this game as it felt it's a rinse and repeat regardless of the region you're in or the background of your team.

Overall, this EA reminds me of other EAs I played where I play for a solid week or two and then hit a hard stop for many years as it just didn't feel wholesome or satisfying.  I guess I'll keep TRYING to play a bit more to see what else I can uncover..

I don't really thumbs down games but would definitely give this game a ""MEH"" for now.
Maybe other users have a more fulfilling and exhilarating experience instead?

Instead of thinking they cant switch, OFC the ability to move your fighters around is obvious but personally i didnt know you could switch fighters at will at the start of combat AND during combat aslong as they havent spent their action. Until i had played the game for a little while. Personally i think there should be a more "" DND "" aspect to the game where the initiative during combat will be based on skill ""and/or dice"" if you decide to implement that in the game.

Running on the world map should be a basic skill that you shouldnt have to spend points on in my opinion, because the fighters are grown ass men and women :P 

I also think that the cooking and the raw material production in camp should be increased to maybe 3 - 5 per rest, at least for a time when you start the game. 

Some paths in the game / on the world map, was pretty wierd to be honest :P

 SPOILERS AHEAD !!!! 

When you go on the mission to kill the colonel alex or (insert name). There should be a tutorial or atleast a hint that the player can plant a piton from their inventory manually. 

Also the mission to go into the ancient tomb or crypt, I only found the path to the place because i saw some random NPC's running in a wierd way down the hill :P but the torch ""preperation hint"" was good :)

You are a band of deserters, bandits with the potential to become unwanted...or ??, or just some farm boys out for fun, that's just 3 of the 5 starting bands of 4. In the end you are mercs or bandits, or a trader, you can even be a cannibal with a pack of hogs you feed instead of regular folks. The game is very open, with lots of side quests, so much so that I don't want to spoil it as it's so new and so many are finding new ways to survive and explore. The devs also have a strong rep, and have produced some very good games, so looking forward to more content. Right now there are 3 provinces I have found,  trade is possible between them, but you will need to protect you goods. Another good money maker is bounty hunting, take prisoners and sell them, but there us a limit. The game is pretty well balanced and does not play like an EA at all, other than lacking voice actors it's pretty polished, the world is quite immersive with each province having it's own main story line....I think they all tie together, trade control seems to be a main motive?

EDIT: Tutorial and tooltips have been added in the Comunity patch for December 2021. Once the autoleveling is addressed too, they will have my thumbsup

It's true. You currently have a lot of gameplay due the big map it already includes. You will really enjoy the early game once you have finished struggling figuring out how everything works, because it's not only there is no tutorial at all, it's that they have not even included tooltips or explanations for all the minigames involving crafting. 

And this is one of the cons I see in this game. It doesn't give you any feedback, you don't know any details about the character classes, which weapons they may use or what abilities will be unlocked when promoting one of your companions to captain or lieutenant. First times you promote someone it’s a guess game adventure, like getting a new crafting recipe for a weapon (no, brutes can’t use axes… seriously?).

The other big reason to not recommend Wartale right now there is no mid or late game content. You can only advance until level 5 and, after that, your companions will randomly get skill points whenever they get a nickname (it may occur several times for the same one and, guess what, the game doesn’t explain why or when nicknames are earned or changed). The only thing that escalates the game is the autoleveling of all the enemies around, which is only useful to generate more of the same with the difference that you will get combats of half an hour or 1 hour instead of the aprox 15 minutes during the early game. Spending almost one hour fighting superboars over and over again in epic battles is not fun, it’s repetitive and boring.

Nevertheless, there are around 10-15 hours of early game quite enjoyable and fun (learning process included). You should do the math if that’s worth 35 € EA for you… But do it in advance, by the time you have learned the game and have passed the exciting first date and start facing reality (the repetition of endless battles), you will not be eligible for a steam refund anymore.

this game seems to be the good old plantera, with a bit more of content and a slight better looking pixel art.

I thin this is the first review I've ever written on steam, and I'm writing it for this because this is an awesome developer and I have loved playing it. I started playing at the beginning of early access and have (so far) put ~200 hours into it.  

This is a thoughtful, and well constructed game. Lots of role playing opportunities and great replay opportunities. My only complaint WOULD have been that the end game becomes a bit too easy, as your troop becomes a bit overpowered, but in the release they have made some small adjustments to combat and so this should be (if you are looking for a challenge) a great turn-based strategy combat. 

The economics are great as well. 10/10 would recommend, and I've only had to kill and eat one of my group once...",1.0

The graphics and music were beautiful and each of the characters had pretty believable motivations. The puzzle sections were also pretty cool and built up in difficulty organically.

506,136603177.0,1772830,"Rusted Moss is a charming game that oozes atmosphere, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But it has several problems. For a 20 euro game, it feels unpolished, like an early access title. I would honestly have preferred to pay 30 for a more polished version of this game.

The Bad:

First, the game is marketed as a twin-stick shooter. But booting the game up it told me to use mouse and keyboard, rather than controller. Using my PS4 controller, the game also doesn't show me correct button symbols, and does not let me bind certain controls to certain buttons (I have not tried using Steam's controller support for this game since many games reliably fail to show correct button symbols.)

Second, the game is marketed as a metroidvania. However, in playing it for six hours I found that the movement system, while rich and with a high skill ceiling, does not properly tutorialize several mechanics and does not properly encourage experimentation because of its difficulty. The level design does not adequately communicate which traversals are possible with the player's current skill set. With my disabilities, I found myself wondering which parts of the game I was 'allowed' to use the fly assist to bypass, and which I was supposed to be gated from entering for story progression reasons. Additionally, in six hours of playing and defeating three major bosses, I found a distressingly small amount of new abilities: the grapple, the high jump, a different gun, and grenades; there were plenty stat upgrades to be sure, but no genuine additions to the kit.

Third, the game is positively punishing in difficulty. This isn't a problem as such, but it is executed in frustrating fashion. The high-skill traversal system makes certain stretches between save points feel like unforgiving gauntlets, both because of the platforming and the enemy ecounters. This is exacerbated greatly by the fact that all progress since last save is lost upon death: all rooms explored, all collectibles found, all lost upon death. For certain collectibles, this made it harrowing to return to a save point.

Fourth, the combat system feels less than fun. The guns have great sound design and interesting firing modes, but the range is so short it feels like artificial difficulty. Since movement is so high-skill as well, this eliminates the greatest advantage the player would otherwise have: positioning. It makes regular enemy encounters feel like a hazard to avoid, in a game that hands the player a machine gun in the first ten seconds. Also the fact that grenades and healing use the same resource just serves to punish the player and disincentivize using the weapons available.

Fifth, there's a couple of minor annoyances. Mostly there are no genuine secrets to find, hidden walls and the like; but I have managed to find at least one instance of a genuinely hidden item close to the starting area, which felt very out of place. It is also possible to unintentionally skip non-repeatable dialogue, and there's no log of previous conversations to review in case that happens. For a game with such a detailed assist menu, it feels rather patronizing that the only option for circumventing platforming troubles is straight up flight; extra grapples in the air would have been a welcome addition, again like Celeste. Also the auto aim just plainly doesn't work.

The Good:

First, the writing. The character dialogue is execellent and genuinely funny. The worldbuilding is compelling and the story isn't front-loaded. Fern and Puck have a pre-established dynamic, and the story begins in medias res after an apocalyptic event, the details of which the player has to uncover. It is a refreshing work of fiction. (The only thing that frustrates me is how the grim tone clashes with the fact that the bosses are mostly left alive and hale for some reason. Would to me make more sense if they died in the battle, or at least were shown to be injured in some way in the aftermath, but that's a nitpick.)

Second, the aesthetic presentation. The graphics are gorgeous, the pixel animation style is well executed and feels nostalgically retro in all the right ways. I am in particular smitten with how each biome has a distinct color tint to the menu; very atmospheric. The animations are solid, the character design is varied and interesting, and the enemy variety is diverse despite all of them being machines. It reminds me of other great works such as Risk of Rain and Hyper Light Drifter.

Third, the music is wonderful. It sets the mood of each area without being intrusive, and it is definitely worth buying the OST download if you like listening to video game soundtracks.

Conclusion:

Rusted Moss is a action-horror platformer with exploration focus. It sets the player up against armies of enemies that the arsenal does not adequately address, and rewards avoiding combat and conserving resources more so than proficient combat. The story is dark, bleak, and apocalyptic, with the player fighting on the side of an inhuman, callously uncaring evil. It struggles with gameplay, but excels in story and visuals.

507,136601816.0,2109430,"It is a VN with puzzle elements. 
Loved Tron as a kid, have not kept up with any lore since the Legacy movie and felt lost a couple times with some of the language but it didn't effect my enjoyment of the game. My first playthrough was maybe 2 hours so it is a short game, however it is the brevity of the game that makes it likely I will replay to try and get a different ending (since choices I may have made contributed to a few too many deaths ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).
Music is good, graphics are Tronish and the story is a standard detective tale. Not entirely sure on how I feel about the puzzles, at first they didn't make sense but by the end they were pretty simple.
I think it was worth the $22 loonies it cost me but I can very much see how others will see it as overpriced.

512,136601407.0,1893370,"So I'm split on this so far. I think this game is doing a lot that I really enjoy: the movement, guns (mostly), aesthetic, and music. 

But some things feel off:
- Mainly most of the maps I've played have felt really small for an arena based game, it often felt like I had way more movement than I needed for the scale of these areas. I know it wasn't an issue of movement because in the more open maps things felt fine. Side note for wall jumping: I think this feature is severely underused. I don't think there was a single instance where I felt that wall jumping would be useful or the better tech option over slide jumping. Just something to consider.
- Then there was the issue of the friendly AI: either the friendly AI is able to essentially play by itself (one flag CTF), or was pretty much useless (Control mode). I would find the AI just sitting in a corner doing nothing or bum rushing the objective and dying almost immediately. This forced me to have to essentially play both the role of offense and defense, though mainly defense. 
- The story thus far has been rough in its' presentation. Too much is thrown at you way too quickly, and my understanding of the world is nonexistent. Your character, Molly, literally spawns into the world and is immediately informed that she is some form of undead that has been brought back to life to compete in arena shooter style combat. Cool, great launch pad for some interesting cyberpunk/hackerman energy. But very quickly after your first clue that things are not what they seem, the story ramps up way too fast without any build up. You're introduced to a cast of character that you very quickly realize don't have a whole lot to do outside of being unique skins for the AI to use in combat. I got the sense that these characters  are supposed to be the main cast you're dealing with, but they have next to nothing to do or say - I just don't care about them. Only one of them gives off a memorable first impression and that's because you have to kill him in the arena. The story also introduces a character that further calls into question the things that have been going on, except the issue is that you haven't had a long enough time to actually see what things are normally like in this world to actually question what had been established. Going forward I would recommend that the story team be a little more patient with showing their hand. Just establish the world that Molly first spawns into: who brought her here, what is their reason, where is she, who are these other characters, what are the basic rules of this world? Let the player understand SOMETHING and have a reason to care about it before you try and subvert what you've established, or begin adding in stakes for characters that I don't have a reason to care about.
- This is my last issue, but it is related to story: the dialogue. It is often ROUGH. The tone is jovial and light, but it is entirely at odds with everything else. The humor is pretty shallow and frankly I wished it was toned down a lot. The dialogue between characters is pretty pointless. It gives you pretty much no extra information about the characters or the world. They seem entirely disconnected from everything going on around them.
- Final thing: The pistol feels off, I don't know if its damage or rate of fire (for either firing mode), but it felt wrong in comparison to every other weapon. Not a huge deal, maybe I just need more time with it. 

In conclusion: I like this game a lot. Playing the game was fun, and though the story hasn't impressed me, almost all of the elements they've introduced in the story are, or could be, really interesting. I have my issues but ultimately I want to see more. SO KEEP GOING DEVS! YOU GUYS HAVE SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL HERE :)

The mood detector is a really cool feature that I think adds a lot to the interactions, especially alongside the characters expressions and effects. The dialogue itself is interesting and you're given a lot of options to respond to characters with. Sometimes your choices aren't obvious, and I really enjoy that.

The music and the style of this game both come together really well to create very immersive, very good looking settings.

There were some issues based around the timed repairs. digging for the right component was difficult because you basically had to guess where they were located(since the pile of components wasn't very accurate to where the components actually were) and it got kind of finicky.

Plantera 2 Golden Acorn is the sequel to 2016's hit farming-style clicker, Plantera. But is the sequel as good as the original? Absolutely. I had dubbed the first iteration, Carpel Tunnel Simulator and part 2 is no different. It adds a few new elements like the addition of the grand tree with said golden acorns, but it's the same cozy clicker game, that in my opinion sh!!ts on Cookie Clicker cause Plantera is just a lot cuter.

Perfect for just turning your brain off to, with all the whimsy and clicking & for the low price of 4.99 USD- I cant recommend this game enough to everyone.

I will say this though, after playing both Plantera games, The Golden Acorn feels a lot shorter. Cause after about 3 1/2 hours I 100% it. While part 1 took me about 13 hours. Still I'm having fun.",1.0

543,136604880.0,1919720,"It's good. Not Vampire Survivors good, but good.

In all seriousness, the game is good. There's nothing visually fancy, but if you're looking for something similar to VS this should give you what you want. There's 12 weapons, 5 characters, 3 stages, and some permanent upgrades. No fancy passive abilities or weapon merges (that I've seen).

Just don't be a silly goose like I was. When you select the mission you're doing for a map, you can select all 5 difficulties, which I thought would unlock the prior goals as I completed them. I was wrong. For example, to unlock level 5 blacksmith upgrades, you need only survive 90 seconds and then kill 400 enemies. I've done this twice, but never got level 5 upgrades because I died before surviving 500 seconds following the 400 enemies. So I 'completed' the goal but died, nulling the goal. Thus, if I'd only selected the first and second missions, I would already have upgraded my weapons (some of them at least) to level five. Well, you live and learn I suppose.

Many references to Chapter One which makes me glad that its fully canonical now in the saga and a direct continuation of young Sherlock growing into the famed detective. I wish theyd elaborated more of John and Sherlock's friendship but there were its wholesome moments throughout the game.

If you get stomped because of the incredible bad matchmaking you can surrender but most new players dont do that so you are stuck in a 10-15 minute game where you cant win and get banned from the game mode.

You have a few game modes but only anihilation is resonable for a new player, the rest are counter strike based modes.

Core gameplay loop revolves around physics interactions (not just the grappling hook) and it allows for some really fun movement tech once you get the hang of it. Bosses have been decent on challenge (around 1-3 runs for me per boss so far), but I think it'll very much depend on how good you get at understanding movement in the game. There's currently limited progression in the form of weapon upgrades, but given that you have to go out of your way to get the upgrade mats, it feels more like a case of ""the good get better rewards"".

I think the skill ceiling for this game is high, and the game does a good job of steadily encouraging you to improve the way you think about the space around you as well as your level of execution.

However, this game can also be very fun once you get the fundamentals down. Don't expect to win on your first several attempts, and spend time learning what everything does. There are several ways to scale and keep up with the difficult enemies this game throws at you, and swapping the places of your units on the field every turn to prevent the most damage is not only necessary, but adds another layer of strategy to the game.

There is also an amazing twist once you beat the final boss the first time, but I wont spoil that here.

You don't necessarily know exactly what you're going to encounter, but for the most part the enemies are very similar in each zone, and y. The art is cute and the musical composition is great (although several hours of hearing the same music will get old.) I do also appreciate how the mechanics are well-explained (if you right-click on cards) and enemy actions are always (with the one exception of [spoiler]Aimless[/spoiler] as well as [spoiler]enemies who explicitly have ""apply X to random enemy"" modifiers[/spoiler]) predictable. Same goes for your own turns.

The comments about balancing are somewhat unreasonable - this game hasn't been out even a day, much less had time for people to develop proper strategies for this. I had some exposure to the game from watching a streamer play it prior to launch, and you definitely can develop a strategy to go forward, even if it's not 100% successful. Yes, it's hard, and you die a lot, and there's RNG (like any roguelike), but it is one of those games that requires time spent to unlock more and get used to the mechanics to make your runs more successful. The RNG is primarily constrained to what cards/charms you get, as with most any deckbuilder.

To the devs: there [i]may[/i] be opportunities to change the balancing in the future, but please wait a bit and see what community forms around this game first before completely nerfing it.

587,136611627.0,1527950,"Overall this is a fun game.  I always enjoyed RPG like settings with larger groups, and this game certainly lets you do that.  It's not overly heavy on the RPG side though, pretty thin for story and dialogue, but it's forte is turn based combat.  

PROs
- Great map interaction, full of little Easter eggs to find
- Fun game-like interactions with picking locks, solving puzzles, using skills, finding hidden objects by searching the screen with cursor etc...
- Large groups!
- Can recruit animals

CONs
- Hard to get going in the early levels, as your small party takes a beating and needs repairs and healing often; gets easier with more members as the overall damage gets spread out between everyone
- Combat gets tedious toward the end, and gets very lopsided with your band gets larger
- Each map zone has a different back story quest to solve, but over all they're identical in nature.  Main quest, side missions from tavern contacts, and random missions to stumble upon.
- Traveling the map is a chore with the length of day and having to rest... seems like you can't travel more than a minute before you have to rest again.  Really needs to be addressed as it's a big detractor from just trying to get around the map and enjoy the game
- Very simple combat system... armor is extra hp, and all damage types translate to hp damage.  There's no chance of missing/dodging an attack during melee, so you area always getting hit every time.  Each side trades turns until one side eventually has more people left
- Tedious having to constantly pay and feed your party, but camp site structures help reduce that headache
- Not a big mix of enemies
- You can buy pack ""ponies"" for hauling more gear, but can't ride horses to make traveling faster?!
- lack of in game quest guide tips, had to use youtube videos at times to figure out what was going on in some quests

I played this game on the fixed level option, so each zone had a set level range.  The starter zone was challenging to get going.  The second zone was fair, but after completing it I out leveled the third zone to the SW and quickly ran through that quest and all missions in a single round of combat every time (think I was lvl 5-6 and the enemy was level 3 or so.  By the time I got the the last zone in the east, I had already started to collect bears for fun, and ended up with 12 or so bears as they're more common on the harder zones (had wolves too but let them go as the bears racked up), and 14 other guys.  It ended up silly as the bears are absolute tanks with 1000+ hp, and can hit for 70+ damage and take up a lot of map space squares to provide nice meat shields for the rest of my party.  I could have just dumped all my human members except for a couple and a beast master, and just played the bears.  The good thing with having animals is you only need to feed them, not pay them, and you don't have to fully feed your group as the other camp bonuses make up for losing happiness due to lack of food.",1.0

611,136607148.0,1811990,"If you like roguelike deckbuilders you will like this game. 

People seem to dislike the difficulty but I think it's in a good spot. Unlike other deckbuilders your main heros hp does not carry over between battles, this means that fights rarely whittle your resources slightly so that you would die three fights from now at the boss. Instead there are less individual fights in a run, but you will regularly go from full strength to dead in a single fight. One or two misplays can kill you if you're not paying attention because every fight needs to be potentially lethal by design. Personally I like it, as beating the fights while killing all the 'treasure goblins' is fun in the early game. While beating the back half requires good deck construction and execution. 

The things that set this apart from other games I've played is the style polish and charm. The bells jingle, the characters move when you drag the cards around. The shopkeeps and town are adorable.  The art is very cohesive and gives the world a sense of whimsy. It puts a smile on my face every time I meet a new npc. Also the game is just fun.

613,136606900.0,1811990,I really enjoy the game and played 3h in the raw. It is taking the best of Slay the Spire but also from Rogue Legacy with our village to build up bringing further cards to build up your deck. However the main issue and I’ve seen other sharing this concern is the game is yet to be well balanced. Any deck building game you’re playing will make a you a hard time the first rounds but once you understand the enemies and your deck then you should never lose the first fights. But here you can because it will depends on what you get when you start. And because you got only one support for the first battle you can get overwhelmed very easily. I went through the third world (two boss fight won) and then I play again and loose again the first battle. So definitely some work to do but the ground is solid and this will be a must have once the balance has been fixed. Or maybe it will never be as this is something that can happen in Rogue Legacy too. Let’s see but I still recommend it. Great game overall.,1.0

616,136606158.0,1811990,"The art style is beautiful, meta progression is implemented in a fun and engaging way that somewhat encourages the player to branch out and try some new stuff ocasionally, the HUD elements are simple and to the point, the soundtrack and visual effects are excellent and although it appears somewhat complex, learning the basics to the combat flow was a breeze. This game has tons of elements that really make it stand out above the crowd, and it does a lot of things in a fresh manner that make it seem a rather promising title, if the proper care is put into it.

Despite all this, at around 20 runs and 3 hours in, it has become clear that the balancing is abysmal. On my first few runs I just brushed it off to being new at the game, but after dying to the first battle in the campaign the first couple of times I figured something was way off, and it seems like this is a common issue to those that have already played the game. Even 
some positive reviews list it as an unbalanced mess

Enemies are numerous and extremely punishing. I enjoy having certain ""factions"" of foes, each possessing varying abilities and passives. You have enemies that focus on shielding themselves, enemies that use their hp as attack value and enemies that focus on debuffing. That being said, each enemy type requires you to have a certain ""answer"" to their skillset, which becomes a frustrating element of the game when you have such limited options to expand your deck and absolutely no way of knowing which enemies you'll end up facing. Got a build that focuses on attacking?  Too bad, for the next fight you'll be pitted against thorned enemies. Oh well, better luck next time. Having fights test the player's deck in different aspects is a great way of keeping the gameplay fresh but this is a ludicrous way of doing so. 

Let's also talk about the wave system in battles. The counter ticks down every turn to punish the player for stalling out fights which is a cool way of keeping combat fluid and engaging, but defeating enemies before the timer runs out just causes instant reinforcements anyway. With that in mind, the player's choice is between 1. Dragging out combat in an attempt to scale your team to face the army of threats aproaching and 2. Rushing the enemies to try and defeat most of them before you get overwhelmed. Not exactly a good way to reward quickly disposing of enemies since you get fucked over for doing so anyway.

Heroes being randomized was something that caught my eye when watching people playing the demo. After playing for a while, though, I wish they had stuck to a more basic approach instead of this messy implementation. Most heroes are delightfully useless, and serve more as a burden than anything else, since you're obligated to put them on the board. If you get unlucky enough with your draw, you might end up just dying outright to the first battle, before you even get a chance to modify your deck, which, albeit hilarious, is pretty bad from a balancing perspective.

The timer on actions was also a fun mechanic to mess around with and explore when I was starting out. However, this means action economy is terribly unbalanced (just as many, many other aspects of this game's combat). The mana system used in most modern deckbuilders triumphs greatly over Wildfrost's take, here, when it becomes painstakingly difficult to keep up with enemies when the players' actions are both costly and widely uninpactful. 

It seems wildfrost is trying to place itself as a challenging game, which I enjoy greatly, but there's also this feeling that the game is afraid of giving the player any agency. You have no reroll options, no chance to pass up a companion or an item (that I encountered in my short time playing) that'll bloat your deck or be left to gather dust in the reserve, and it makes me scratch my head and ask: ""why?""

Companions themselves (and heroes, for that matter) are largely designed to be brittle and fragile, as to make positioning and delaying enemy actions (or killing them outright before they even get a chance to act) important, but at the same time, the game makes them widely meek compared to enemies. You have heroes with whopping 7 cooldown triggers that dont even deal direct damage. You have pets, which are unique to the start of the game, occupying a slot that could be used for a companion later, which actively encourage you to trash them when you get better units.

 Most synergies that don't work instantly with your starter hero will be disappointing until more companions and items are in your deck (if you even survive to that point) that fit that particular role, and you're not even guaranteed to get any. Add this to the fact that you have a measly 2 slots for companions before you have to replace some, and also that you're not even guaranteed heroes that'll sinergize with anything and things will start to look bleak before you even start a run.

I could go on and on. Wildfrost's current state in balancing is apalling. I would ask for a refund if I could. I encourage anyone reading this to either skip completely or wait for a heavy discount. Of course, I'll edit this if things change, but even if I'm being optimistic, there's a lot, and I mean [b] a lot [/b], of work to be put in this game before I'd recommend it.

617,136607691.0,1811990,"Superb graphical and musical design and (imho) great gameplay. 
Game autosaves after every turn, so you physically can't save scum battles like in Slay the Spire for example. And you usually get severely punished for missplays. 
Sometimes a turn has too much going on and it's hard to plan your next move and easy to make a mistake, but when (if) you figure it out, it really makes you feel smart. 
Haven't noticed any ""unfair RNG"" that some reviewers talk about, skill issue in my opinion ;). 
Haven't been able to progress too far yet, so no comments on replayability.

619,136606733.0,1527950,"Oh, fellow gamer, let me regale you with my thoughts on the fantastic Wartales game! It's a game that's similar to Battle Brothers, but with its own unique mechanics and graphics. While the genre is the same, the game feels refreshingly different and new.

What I particularly love about Wartales is its challenging gameplay. Although I will admit that it's slightly easier than Battle Brothers at the moment, the developer seems to be working on making the game even tougher, and that's something I'm eagerly anticipating! After all, what's a game without a good challenge, am I right?

I have nothing but praise for the game's management and fighting aspects. The game has a good balance between these two elements, and it's what makes it so addictive and enjoyable to play. I'm absolutely hooked, and I can't get enough of it!

As a hardcore gamer, I'm not easily impressed, but Wartales has truly won me over. I would happily give it a 9/10 rating, and I would definitely buy it again without hesitation.

625,136606912.0,2354600,"Alright, so here it goes...I'll start with a simple Pros and Cons list which is usually a quick and easy way to gauge if you wanna play this game or not. 

Pros:
- Great art style with an amazing color palette and ""bloom"" or glowing effects from items and ambient set pieces
- Music is fun and not subjectively not annoying
- Character movement is smooth and effortless
- Very easy to earn tons of coins which in turn helps level up your character fairly quickly
- Combat is varied but in an old school fun kind of ""megaman needs to dodge energy balls"" kind of way, if that makes any sense
- Variety of enemies keeps you on your feet which can be exciting
- Power-Up's make you feel actually powerful but not OP which is a good balance
- UI is easy to navigate, includes plenty of language and customization options which is much appreciated

Cons:
- None of the purchasable powerups have explanations which would be nice before spending coins on them
- Certain powerups have a painfully long cooldown (I'm looking at you Snickerdoodle)
- The difficulty level is a bit rough too early in the game, getting to the 4th or 5th instance can be a bit of a challenge and should be a tad bit easier (level 1 and 2 should be a breeze for those possibly unfamiliar with these types of games)
- More lore would be nice even if the player hasn't seen the movie but this is just me nitpicking lol

Look, its an Early Access game for like what...5 bucks or something? Buy the damn thing and have some fun. It clearly needs some work but that's almost too harsh of a term, it needs good buff and polish job. IMO all the hard work was already done and it shows. This is basically a better looking version of Vampire Survivors with a bit less content is all. The game clearly doesn't take it self seriously and I love that, I'm here to have fun and accomplish something, this game lets you feel like you're doing that without trying to convince you that you're a vampire! 

Go have fun!

630,136606623.0,1527950,"I've been with this game for about a year, so into early access but not super far back, and seeing this game just get progressively better every new patch is great.

Pros:
-Combat is super fun. It can be really challenging at times, but not impossible to the point where it feels like you're climbing up a mountain. There's a lot of strategy, especially on the expert difficulty (which you should play on), and the enemy variety, as well as environmental factors and many other small things, makes it so that every skirmish is different. Each class have subclasses which amounts to a huge variety of combos you can run. You can have really dope synergies in your troop.
-Campaign mechanics, aka when you're walking around with your troop, picking up quests, feeding them, etc, is very satisfying. It's not super micromanagement heavy, but you still need to pay attention to your ressources, your troop's happiness, your relationships, food and gold so your playthrough doesn't go haywire.
-Graphics are good and very consistent. The style of the game is nice to look at and each area has something new to look at. most areas will look different, combat animations are very crisp and have a lot of girth and power behind them, and extra things like weather look good to.
-The devs are super proactive and responsible. They constantly listen to player feedback and they're on top of patching and updating the game. Major respect for that.

Cons:
-The game doesn't really have a main story. If you want a story driven game, this ain't it, because this is one of those 'make your own story' games. The lack of a main narrative doesn't really upset me personally, but not having characters or a plot really takes away from choices you have to make throughout your playthroughs. It's not that big of a downfall.
-Difficulty scaling in this game can be a little weird at times. For the most part, I think the difficulty is pretty reasonable (it also depends on the difficulty your playing on). However, it's very easy to get absolutely dumpstered early on by enemies that you really shouldn't run in to. Even in the mid and late parts of the game, some fights like arena challenges are pretty unfair at times, sometimes warranting the acquirement of some legendary weapons or serious levelling up to stand a chance.
-It's not as big of a problem as it used to be, but foraging for resources on the campaign map is still a little janky at times. Sometimes resources spawn outside the map or in impossible to reach places, and your troop's movement is very sensitive. It can be really annoying at times when you're trying to go up a hill but there's a small bit of impassible terrain in your way and your troops completely ignores its move order. The devs are aware of this jankiness however and i'm certain this will be addressed more in the future.
-Relationships in your troop happen passively overtime, whether your guys are saving each other's asses, drinking booze together by the fire and joking, or doing the opposite and cursing each other out, fighting one another, etc. It's cool, but it really doesn't change much in the game. You get small bonuses if 'friends' are next to each other, but the damage bonuses are very small and aren't super noticeable. From the start of my longest playthrough to the end of it where my relationships started at 0 until I had a troop of 23 guys who all loved each other, I could hardly tell if relationships had done anything. Hopefully they're changed to be more prevalent and actually affect the troop more seriously like in Darkest Dungeon 2.

These cons are very minor and in a few months time, I bet they will have been addressed by the devs already, so take them with a grain of salt. The fact I can only think of these minor negatives about Wartales says a lot about how fun this game is. Definitely worth the purchase, even at its full price, and if you see it on sale, 100% grab it if you're even slightly interested.

It's not like the game is ""too hard"" as others have claimed the negative reviews are about, it's just nothing like any other deckbuilder i've ever played. In a bad way.

669,136613378.0,1811990,"I see a lot of complaints that this game is too hard or is not balanced properly.  This made me hesitant to buy the game at first, but I got it anyway and I'm glad I did.  I disagree with the complaints.  People who think this game is too hard have probably never gotten an Ascension 20 heart kill in Slay the Spire.

I only have about 4 hours in the game so far.  Maybe it will scale up in difficulty as I progress, like Slay the Spire did.  I have finished 2 runs and the game has been quite fun already.  I didn't find it to be too difficult; in fact, on my first blind play-through, I reached what was probably the final boss.  I lost to him because I didn't understand his mechanics, but I think I understand them now and that defeating him should be quite doable.  I think I could have won on my 2nd play-through, but I was playing at 2 AM and due to tiredness left my leader in front of the boss's 50 damage attack when I had plenty of ways to prevent that from happening.  I think I definitely would have won otherwise.  Either way, not bad for a 2nd play-through.  

All that is to say, I don't think this game is too hard at all, and I think it has a lot of interesting synergies that I am eager to explore.  If you have ever gotten an Ascension 20 heart kill in Slay the Spire, then ignore all of the negative reviews complaining about difficulty and balance.  The same can be said if you've ever gotten a max covenant win in Monster Train.  

This game has pleasant art and sound design.  The way you play cards in rows is somewhat reminiscent of Monster Train, but there are other aspects which make the game play feel quite unique, like only playing 1 card per turn (mostly, unless you have a specific buff on a card).  

I'm glad I bought the game.  I have played enough Slay the Spire (about 500 hours) and Monster Train (about 200 hours) that I have been burnt out on both of them several times.  This game scratches the itch for a rogue like deck builder and is unique enough to feel fresh and exciting for me.",1.0

674,136614239.0,1893370,"Journalistic integrity disclosure: I am Rumbletron's cousin and his grandma is paying me to mow her lawn.

This is a very short early access release. First episode or not, it's more of a decent-sized demo than anything. I'd say it's worth keeping an eye on, but you may want to hold off for a little while unless you really, really want this to support this right off the bat.
What Ghostware: Arena of the Dead is not is a traditional single-player FPS. As it stands, it's more like a series of bot matches with the odd campaign level or mid-level event here and there, and after you clear an arena, you revisit it and look for secrets. Some of these secrets directly give you upgrades, but most give you links to fictional websites you visit through your in-game browser, and it's through these that much of the story is told.
This is what distinguishes Ghostware most right now, and in my opinion it should lean even more into this than it does at the moment. When it does, it has this atmosphere and sense of mystery and discovery that the game's more traditional cutscenes and dialogue lack. It's teetering on this strange line between just okay and potentially really, really distinct and memorable. This is a game that needs to go all the way, do weird stuff, and take risks if it wants to succeed. Break the ""game,"" throw unfinished level geometry and out of bounds areas at the player, feed him a bunch of links that may or may not have much to do with the plot, really, just spitball a bunch of weird shit and focus more on that than polish and traditional game narrative.

To conclude this half-asleep review, I say to the devs,

681,136614543.0,1811990,"Game needs to be expanded upon. The entire campaign is somewhere around 10 battles that are extremely intense. Some of them include deck checks that are complete bs if you don't know they're coming. It's one of those games where you spend the entire time thinking, ""How do I lose?"" instead of ""how do I win?""

Some events like the muncher (thins your deck) and charms (too easy to get something useless for your deck) sound good but end up being noob traps because having a follower synergy is way more important. Now those events wouldn't be useless if the campaign was longer and you actually had some time to refine your deck, but you don't. Likewise, the shortness of the campaign also makes certain synergies not viable because you probably won't have time to put it together.

There's a lot of reviews already claiming this game to be too hard or have difficulty spikes. I don't mind when a game is challenging, if anything i prefer it, it keeps things interesting and engaging. 

This game however does not feel challenging, it feels unfair. I rarely (if ever) feel I could have made different choices to have changed the outcome upon defeat leaving me with little to nothing to learn from. The way the enemies are balanced, their abilities and base stats, feels as though they expect you to have a powerful build put together by the time you get them but provides so few ways to manipulate your deck building to create a deck with enough synergy. Even in the few times I DO get solid deck together getting through an encounter is sketchy at best.

There's a lot of potential here though. Some adjustments to the games balance whether it be providing more deck manipulation, weighted synergy RNG, or reduced enemy numbers could very easily bring the game into a great spot and change this review.

- the innovative counter system.
- the replayability added by the randomly generated heroes
- the charm upgrade system

The game overall is extremely polished. The combat is unique to the genre with dynamic positioning options, card selections and manipulation, and tons of emergent gameplay with the mechanics interactions. Lots of decision-making and thought involved in your play patterns. Really creative ways to pilot your units and give them synergy.

I will echo what other reviewers mentioned though, which is that the runthroughs can feel really feast or famine. There are some issues:
- Enemies that force 'Aimless' onto your allies or have Aimless themselves feel very unfair, forcing your units to attack into thorns or other detrimental effects or to possibly get sniped by enemies. I think like 50% of my runs ended to Aimless RNG.
- No option to decline card additions or hero additions.
- Starting heroes can be very very bad with not many ways to salvage them.
- No ways to mitigate bad RNG--not enough removal options. Maybe put discovered charms in the shop at a higher cost (Slay the Spire does this with relics and its a nice touch). There are a lot of charms that feel completely useless.
- Limited path branching means not as much agency with map nodes--would like to see that expanded to have more choices.

714,136616532.0,1811990,"Summary of the negative reviews: ""Waah the hard card game is too difficult >:("". To address the negative reviews seriously. They mostly complain about game balance, but the game offers a lot of powerful mechanics to the player, and challenges presented feel very reasonable, usually only requiring a shift in strategy to address. Think Slay the Spire, that game is brutally difficult and is beloved for it, this game is in the exact same vein. Yes it's hard, but it offers so many ways for the player to succeed. Clear example is the companion Yuki, you can easily buff him to have more than 30 attack (heck much more in my experience) simply by spamming frost, this is enough to kill most bosses in one hit. He's too squishy for a particular boss? Give him shields. Low on health? Recall him, the attack buff stays for the whole combat. Anyways my actual review is below.

My experience playing this has been absolutely great. First of all I love to see a fully complete game being released, it's surprisingly uncommon these days. Past that the game oozes charm and is extremely fun to boot. I'll lay out some pros and cons, but generally if you like card roguelikes and the art you'll love this one.

Pros
- Absolutely charming art
- Fun characters
- Unique and interesting card roguelike format
- Card effects feel varied and unique

Cons
- Random leader selection is a fun idea but leaders often feel less powerful and unique as the companion cards",1.0

For positives the the visuals/music are amazing, and I love the character designs. Everything is just so bright and color, definitely stands out compared to the likes of Monster Train and Slay the Spire. Though in a game like this I feel gameplay is the most important part, and this game stumbles rather hard on that front. You either get an amazing combo within the first 1-2 areas or you die. It ramps up far to quickly most of the time, to the point where most strategies don't work because you can't wait to get the cards you need. Either the card works now or you die, with rarely any inbetween. Hell you can get an amazing combo and still die thanks to the enemies just hard countering your strategy. Have fun with that barrage build when the enemies have nothing but teeth. There are plenty of interesting ideas don't get me wrong, but there really needs to be some work with this.

 However, I could not get past the puzzle aspect and immediately wanted to skip it after the first play through. Not that it was hard, but rather that it became a game of connect the dots more than a puzzle card game. It became rather tedious and frustrating, and as the story got closer to the finish the puzzles got longer instead of harder.

 To tell the truth I never even learn how the puzzles worked until the very end of my second play though more out of curiosity then need.  It was faster to just connect the dots so to speak then try and figure out the puzzle.

It is a little weird, to not have disc battles or lightcycle races in a Tron game - but this isn't what this game is trying to be. The description, screenshots and trailers make it pretty clear what it is and I think the price tag is pretty fair in that regard.

As far as MTX go you can buy operators, skins (skins give bonus exp) and a premium sub that gives more exp/credits.

I'm a big fan of the Tron IP and it's such a shame that so little is done with it in terms of games. So when i heard they were making a VN detective game i was so excited as its a part of the universe we don't see much if at all and i think this really delivers that experience 

Set in a separate area from the movies lets this stand on its own, even though we got a short time with these characters we still learn alot about this world and how it has and is still evolving and changing, the talk of past wars, enemies and friends, new factions and ideologies. I want to talk more and spend more time here.

The game is short and i can see people getting annoyed with the puzzle gameplay but i found it a nice change of pace.

I wouldn't pay too much attention to the players screeching because they haven't won a run yet, seeing this complaint a lot recently on more difficult roguelikes.  Dudes with 2 hours in a game expecting to be cruising through everything is laughable.  I personally get excited when a deckbuilder makes me sweat.

777,136621515.0,1811990,"I've followed the game since its first anouncement on the Nintendo Direct a year ago. I've played demo for hours and hours and it's a blast to finally touch the real thing.

The gameplay is quite original. I spent a lot of time on Slay the Spire, which is also a Deckbuilder/Roguelike, but it has a completely difference turn system which is very fresh. Each action has a great impact on the game, and you need to think wisely about if using that card is worth a turn, or not.

Graphics and musics are just perfect. I'm a sucker for this art style.

I see a lot of people posting negative reviews because of balancing problems. I can agree that some mechanics are clearly more powerful than others, but that's also the fun of it, discovering what works or not. I'd like to see corrections and new mechanics added in the future, but for the time being, I think it does the work well enough. My only real critic would be that we have too little control over the contruction of our deck. More ways to banish a card or reroll a treasure would certainly be a nice addition.

It is quite a difficult game, that's for sure. I don't see it as a negative though, quite the opposite. Just take that into consideration if you're not a big fan of struggle.

778,136621393.0,1811990,"I have to echo many of the sentiments of those who have had issues with this game. I want to love Wildfrost, the graphics and presentation are just utterly amazing. The charm that this game imparts is something that keeps drawing me back to play another run, but the immense number of balance issues prevent me from trying this game any further. This is sad given that I absolutely love this genre, and would've loved another game to sink more time into, but in its current form, I cannot recommend it.

Balance issues are as follows:

1. Heroes are generally pretty bad: The heroes that you get to select at the beginning are, more often than not, underwhelming and completely eclipsed by the enemies you'll face, both in terms of health and damage output. This makes the early game significantly more difficult as I found that I was always leaning towards the tougher heroes and neglecting the ones with special abilities, simply to ensure that I had enough output to keep up with the games difficulty ramp.

2. Most companions, charms and treasures are either bad, or just actively make your deck worse: Building a deck around some kind of strategy becomes either rare, or nearly impossible when the choices of companions you're presented with are basically unplayable, or don't meld well with your existing deck. The inability to 'skip' a pick, means you're forced to actively add cards to your deck that make an already bad deck, worse. The charms are all over the place, and the fact that you only get a single charm to pick from when you find them in the dispensers means that quite often you get less out of the route you take then you would otherwise need to keep up. Many of the charms are just straight up bad. I only once in all my runs managed to put some kind of coherent strategy together, and even then it wasn't enough to beat the run.

3. Enemies swarm you: It didn't take long me to realise that this games balance has some serious issues, particularly when waves of enemies keep spawning at a rate far greater than your ability to dispose of them. Given that many enemies can act faster, have more health, and even hit harder than anyone on your team, it makes the swarming even worse. Most of my runs ended because I simply couldn't keep up with the sheer number of enemies that were appearing on the screen. When the mini-boss of each stage appears, if you haven't sufficiently dealt with prior enemies, it can make the game unplayable in terms of difficulty.

I enjoy a challenging game, and don't mind taking the time to learn how to play these better in order to overcome the difficulty, but Wildfrost's balance makes any attempt to trying to do that seemingly pointless. Beating this game seems to come down more to RNG with card choices, and charms then it does with the actual skill of the player. Either you lucked out on an extremely good deck, or your run is just dead.

For the above reasons (and many others that have been mentioned in other reviews), I cannot recommend Wildfrost.",0.0

In 4 hours I played 4 runs, won 2 of them, and died once to the final boss and once midway through. Balancing seems fine. Or maybe I am just lucky :P

Game is awesome. The pixelated style is a common choice for these roguelite games, but the combination of the music, the animations, and the sometimes goofy moments makes me wonder what the movie will be like. Which...is probably what the developers want, but I have to say, they do it well. So whatever gripes I may have being advertised to by a videogame are all unimportant since it worked >:)

Some visual/gameplay issues I noticed. Hitboxes are not very defined. I can sometimes get right into an enemy's face without getting hit, and the others it feels like I got suckerpunched from nowhere. And that is just the melee enemies. The enemy bullets are hard to keep track of. I had a buddy watch me from the side and with all the shimmying about I was doing to hit the enemies, I neglected the bullets that were apparently obvious. Now, that might be my ADHD at play, but I was definitely getting better about avoiding most of the onslaught of projectiles. Another issue is the controls. Not having a cursor from your mouse made things a little wonky in the menu screen. At first, the game crashed on exit, but it seems that was fixed pretty quickly. Also, don't expect to win...for some time. Or maybe I am just bad at the game (:

Ideas for the future? I am not going to tell the developers how to play the game, but some things I had questions on are how hard it is to understand anything. For example, the Victims you are to save or kill...I think an achievement is related to this option, but I can't determine how to go about it. I both saved and killed the Cheerleader in the first level with Renfield, but there was no obvious difference in result, save for time remaining upon reaching the boss room and the amount of money that was rewarded. Is money going to be more important in a future update? Also, the shop was a little surprising. It took me a bit to realize there were other tabs lol. Also also, the coffin was something I wasn't sure what it did until I realized I had to buy it multiple times. I had thought its effect was an upgrade I got in a run.

All-in-all, the game is hectic, visually stimulating, probably a good game to watch for streamers, and if this is just the beginning, then I am looking forward to what the developers bring in the future.

I will keep playing just to see if beating the levels in both Feed and Save options for both playable characters will do something. Then I will play to see if there are good synergies.

Sometimes at the end of a battle you try to click continue and it'll sit there for 5-6 minutes before giving you the reward and allowing you to continue. Sometimes it just locks up entirely and you gotta reload before the battle and replay the whole thing. Hope you saved because the auto save overwrites itself. On top of all that it encrypts all the values to prevent people from cheating in a single player game. Annoying and dumb design decision. Let people cheat in single player games if they want. 

Wait a few weeks/months for the bugs to be fixed. Absolutely don't buy if you use a multi-monitor setup. It's an exercise in frustration using 3 monitors. Given how often it crashes it absolutely needs multiple autosaves and shouldn't just overwrite the exiting one into state where it crashes when you click continue at the end of a battle. Also at least one farm in the starting zone doesn't have an exit.... Hope you enjoy replaying the last autosaved battle.",0.0

As little Ellie embarks on her Easter egg hunt adventure, the game masterfully blends whimsy and terror, immersing players in a dark and twisted world beneath the surface. The graphics and sound design evoke a haunting atmosphere, with eerie music and unsettling visuals that keep you on the edge of your seat.

Dye The Bunny's narrative is both chilling and captivating, making it difficult to look away even when you're on the verge of screaming. The game's developers have taken a creative risk by combining the innocence of childhood with the darkness of horror, and the result is a unique experience that will leave a lasting impression on players.

Overall, Dye The Bunny is a must-play for horror enthusiasts and those seeking a fresh twist on a classic holiday celebration.

Example: Third fight in the run. I have been able to pick TWO additional cards from six options so far this run:

Got a guy that gives teeth (damage when hit) to all his teammates but he's sat at the second row (behind someone else I have to kill first to hurt him). My range cards do two damage and has 14 health. 

I can't fight the enemies in front of him as they have teeth that hurt me, and I can't hurt him as I don't have a yank or long range damage card as none have been offered to me. I just lose.

In most games, of this kind, such as Slay the Spire, you get like 30 choices of cards to add to the deck, events to get things that change your playstyle etc. over the course of a run. That gives you the ability to minimise the effect of RNG, so you can strategise and make the most of a bad situation if it comes to that.

This game gives you about 9. This means the enemies ramp up quickly and so the only successful runs will be the ones where you get extremely lucky. There's no chance to mitigate bad RNG. You just don't get the opportunity. You have to hope every time you get a card or charm that it's the exact one you need.

>>>>>>> 22ca15cc8f142b6bee681ff83a1a3d81d50a9551

Just gonna say first of all this game is fun gameplay is actually really good but I decided to calculate how long it would take to collect all operators that are available for purchase through just the daily challenges as I have yet to unlock the weekly challenges or any of that so will update this accordingly when I get to that point. And as a addition this is without unlocking any operator upgrades or skills as the time would heavily differ

Credits from daily objectives:
No Premium = 27,050
Premium = 38,850

To get all operators for a class is:
100,000 x 3 = 300,000 credits
150,000 x 5 = 750,000 credits
200,000 x 6 = 1,200,000 credits
All together = 2,250,000 credits
(This isn't counting the 4 operators that could only be obtained through a previous battle pass)

So to get all operators for a class as both a non premium and premium player (Remember this game has 4 different classes)
Non Premium - 2,250,000/27,050 = Approx. 84 days of daily challenges
Premium - 2,250,000/38,850 = Approx. 58 days of daily challenges

If you wanted to buy these with coins (the premium currency) operators in this game cost either 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 coins depending on credit cost of operator (shown above)

Prices for coins:
2,250 coins = $11.99
5,000 coins = $23.99

I get it as a free to play developer you need to be making money but if you don't really give a decent incentive and give people the opportunity to unlock stuff in your game within a somewhat timely manner then this might knock a lot of people from wanting to play a game

Like I mentioned at the start the gameplay of this is really fun has a nice ghost recon feel to it and this game could really be something good but please look into what people get with their time

After 100+ hours in FX on Epic and 100+ hours in FX3 on a lot of the same tables, the new FX is my go-to platform and the one I see myself playing long into the future.  

The difference is all in the physics.  There's some visual upgrades for sure - which are actually a mixed bag at the moment, because while the game looks great, it's wildly unoptimized - but what's important in pinball is how it /feels/, and FX feels fantastic.  To compare the two, FX3 is fun and springy, easy and arcadey, while FX, to me, feels like far more like playing real pinball.  It's more challenging and realistic, more unpredictable, faster and less forgiving.  The default competitive mode is ""Classic"", which allows you to play for scores and excludes the powerups that were a necessity in the default mode of FX3 if you wanted to top the leaderboards.  If you're still after the powerups, you can find them in ""Arcade"" mode, but ""Classic"" feels great in my hands, and if you want a challenge even above that, there's ""Pro"" mode on each of the Williams tables with a steeper playfield and tougher rules.  

This game is imperfect, and a work in progress (please add proper Ultrawide support!), but it doesn't deserve to be drowned out in negative reviews.  I'll update this with some more detailed thoughts, but if you're any sort of a pinball fan at all, ignore the hubbub and give FX a look.  You'll be glad you did.",1.0
836,136622979.0,2328760,"Having played many hours on Epic, I'm so happy to see this launch on Steam. The biggest draw to Pinball FX is the updated physics system coming from the prior entry, Pinball FX3. While much of this may feel minor at first, the ball behaves far more consistently across different tables and the challenge on the non simulator pinball tables (i.e, Zen Originals and franchise crossovers) is much faster and weighty. Graphically, it is a solid improvement if you have a capable PC. The ray-tracing is nice, although not mandatory. It is much improved over its early access performance, and I now get around 90FPS with max graphics settings at 1440p with ray-tracing enabled. Hey, it's just nice to see those reflections on the glossy board :-) 

The elephant in the room is the lack of DLC carryover to the new platform. While unfortunate, I believe this is a passion project geared towards enthusiasts. Recreating each table takes time, so does implementing ray-tracing, updating lighting, and ensuring all of the prior systems work with how the ball and flippers now behave; this is no small feat. Given the DLC packs which discount purchases of updated tables if you already own them on PFX3 (See the legacy bundles), I think it is fair. Zen have provided multiple ways to discount tables and assist long-term players in the transition to the new system. 

No, you don't *need* to update to Pinball FX if you are happy with Pinball FX3. Keep your purchases there and keep enjoying the game! Those tables are still great. However if you are an enthusiast, you will enjoy playing these tables with their updated physics along with the already hefty amount of new content. I have particularly enjoyed Wrath of the Elder Gods, Grimm Tales, World War Z and the new William's tables (Addams Family, finally!). 

Two thumbs up from me. Zen have really pulled through after their rocky launch on Epic and I'm excited to see how this platform develops for years to come. Between the Punishinly accurate Williams simulations, the video-gamey Zen Originals and numerous franchise crossovers, I believe Pinball FX has truly become THE hub for Pinball, no matter how you engage with the game.",1.0

840,131242928.0,2077590,"Feels like a frustration simulator.

Even though the point is obviously to survive the 20 waves, it still feels more of a pointless endeavor than other games within this genre. It may be because the enemies are all autopathing looking like they are in a MOBA going to a tower, but they are just doing large loops around the map I think, with no destination. 

There are good bits that, if changed quite a bit, may be fun in the future. But I think the majority of positive reviews currently posted are probably less than genuine. I would have returned it even for the $3, but I took my dog out for a walk and didn't see I left it on for 2.5 hours.",0.0
841,130907751.0,2077590,"I had high hopes for Sidestep Legends and I really wanted to like it because the concept is neat, but I feel like I keep going back to it and it just doesn't quite click for me. The player is offered a traditional bullet heaven control scheme, with WASD or gamepad stick usage and fixed camera, or one closer to MOBAs with the mouse doing all the heavy lifting. It's all about sidesteps, avoiding enemy attacks, traps and more, with a handful of enemy types roaming on predetermined paths as the mobs in a MOBA unless the player bothers them. Unlike the waves of Vampire Survivors clones, Sidestep Legends barely features any attack that can be used to damage opponents while moving, so players will be required to keep switching between moving and standing still, to dodge and to attack respectively. This is a fun take on the genre for sure, as it adds an extra layer of strategy and decision-making, on top of a higher skill ceiling.

The issue is that it doesn't really feel too rewarding. The enemies are not very varied, and they pose a challenge pretty much only because the player has to stop to fight them, with an initial attack range pre-upgrades that is quite laughable. The base attacks and speeds are also superlow, though upgrades make them a lot more satisfying eventually. The map has XP gems and coins spawn all across, with even treasure chests and challenges filling in the blanks, but often these happen far away from enemies who, remember, follow predetermined paths. The game actively pushes you away from the action a lot of the time, with traps like gas waves, fire areas and hooks pulling the player back for extra challenge. This is the game's incentive to have the player moving... but again, you are supposed to stop to attack, which means that most of the time you will not be attacking, as it doesn't take long before you are looking at a couple dozen enemies and traps are spawning everywhere. 

Couple all this with fairly unimpressive 3D visuals and a skill tree that's packed with tons of expensive yet minor upgrades, and I just can't say that I truly enjoy or want to recommend this game yet. Even when the upgrades become more satisfying, some higher level skills and characters are unlocked and you're battling against a giant boss, at its core Sidestep Legends feels like you're fighting against the game's design trying to slow your every move and attack more so than the hundreds of identical minions you encounter in a run. A good bullet heaven and a good MOBA both make you feel swift and powerful, and unfortunately that feeling is too rare here for me to recommend the game as of now. I plan to revisit it in the future because it's still in Early Access and I believe the concept can achieve a lot more with some balancing and design tweaks.

The Gameplay feels good: the TTK is quite quick but not too quick and the weapons feel great and powerful.
The movement has a slight learning curve too it (not negative) since you can turn in all directions in anyway which can make you loose orientation, but you do get used to it.


Overall i think this game has great potential. With just some polishing, frequent updates and a steady playercount i can see this game become quite popular amongst FPS and space enjoyers.",1.0

861,136637729.0,2342030,"I'm really on-the-fence with this one. On one hand, I genuinely had fun for a number of hours so far playing this. On the other hand this is mobile-game levels of pay2win that makes even world of tanks look respectable.

So basically you have a clone (visually) to world of tanks, now you remove ALL of the armor/hit/bounce/pen mechanics. Replace it with two hitboxes per tank, and the tank is hit in Box A (The front/top/front 90% of the sides) that tank takes 50% of the damage done by the gun. If the round hits Box B (The rear and the back 20% of the sides) it takes 100% of the damage done by the gun.

That pretty much sums up the general gunplay, very arcade'y. The game does stir things up a bit with equipment which acts as tank abilities. (Some tanks only have access to certain ones.) Which can set things on fire, place landmines, repair, debuff enemy tanks, buff your tank, etc. And they can be used repeatedly with a long cooldown.

The actual gameplay mechanics make less sense. There are bases for each team, and they can be captured. But they serve no purpose currently, they don't win the match, they don't prevent enemy respawns, they don't get points, nada. Broken/missing mechanics basically. Also players can respawn into ANY tanks they have left after dying, so matches can go on for a LONG time with each player having like 5-12 tanks eventually, there is a time limit however.

Ok, so onto the bad. The game sells pay2win to some insane levels. decals/camo even give SUBSTANTIAL damage buffs. (like 10% each) There is also gold ammo, but since there is no armor pen/bounce system, it just straight up does +50% damage AND randomly disables any tank shot with it briefly. If you have it, and someone else doesn't, you automatically win ANY shootout, even if your in a light tanks and they are in a heavy tank. There is also pay2win equipment, pay2win premium tanks that are +30% stronger than the normal ones. The list is a mile long on the Pay2win.

98% of the enemy tanks are also bots currently. Very few players. The A.I. is pretty good though and acts like a only marginally mentally retarded player. They will also ALWAYS target you immediately if you shoot them, even if they are in a 9-way melee range shootout and you snipe at them from a mile away, they will immediately ignore everything else and fire at you. Making the A.I. effective at killing YOU, but not good at winning a match.",1.0
862,136637589.0,2318550,"A straightforward action game where you must eliminate enough enemies to advance to the next level. 

Despite the fact that the game is marketed as a shooter, melee scythe attacks end up being more effective because they hit with a broad swipe. Furthermore, the controls don't operate in a twin-shooter fashion, making it challenging to get the perfect shot. 

The main goal of most stages is to eliminate all enemies, but occasionally you also need to accomplish things like close portals that continually create enemies. Because you have to drag an extremely slow ball to the portal, these stages aren't very good. The fact that you must always stay close makes things worse; if you stray too far, it will stop following.

Progress can’t be lost. Dying just requires you to restart the current level and keep trying until you succeed. The following stage may be made even more challenging, though. Health is carried over to the next stage along with everything else you've acquired, such as ammo and souls that act as currency. 

The problem happens if you finish the stage with only a few health bars. Because health drops are rare, this means you will be stuck with that health the entire stage. It’s possible to turn a difficult stage into an chore that never becomes fun again.

863,136637957.0,2109430,Short and sweet. Good story and good vibes. Would recommend if you want two hours of Tron. Also always great to see a Black protagonist don't get too many of those.,1.0
864,136637757.0,2109430,"I'm not a big visual novel guy, so keep that in mind.

As a game? The story was engaging, I could suspend my disbelief enough to feel like I was the one making decisions, and the decisions feel meaningful. The puzzle mechanic wasn't stellar and felt like an  obstacle rather than a challenge, but it was fun nonetheless. 

As a Tron Game? I found it super interesting how they decided to expand the world of Tron and it makes me excited they're trying to reach out past the light cycles and disc games. IMO I don't really like some of the expansions to the world and the major secret trouble (no spoiler pog) feels a little off. However, I'm glad someone has a new take of what Tron can be. 

After all what is Tron? I think Tron is the exploration and intrigue of a cool idea. Discs, cycles, trees, and puzzles are just cool ideas branching off. I give this game a solid recommend. 6.5/10 for casuals and very enjoyable 2-6 hours of decently replayable experience. I'm off to do homework before starting a new run that's for sure.",1.0
865,136637117.0,2156300,"I understand that there will be more episodes later down the line. So the pricing isn't an issue for me. My issue is the lack of substance in the writing. The developer like the boast about how this is specifically a visual novel, but fail to understand decent writing is an important part of that. If you're going to disregard that the majority of your fan base came from your AVN college kings, then fine. But you'll have to come with your A game if you're going to leave out explicit content, and strictly rely on your writing merit. And FYI CK DIDN'T HAVE GOOD WRITING!

There's nothing interesting about the plot in this game. The main character is childlike and whiny, and his friends are unbearable. The only 2 characters that are solid is River and the brother Lance. Who the game is trying its best to paint as a bad dude, but instead paints the MC as a whiny brat who doesn't care about his family. 

All choices you pick are in a range of being either neutral or whiny. And a lot of the time, are confusing to understand in the context of the conversation being had.

The camera also needs to be zoomed out, by at least double. The amount of times I've jumped into a bullet off-screen is insanely frustrating.

And for a game where the grappling hook is one of the primary selling points, it's way to unreliable for height and found myself rarely using it after gaining other traversal methods, and avoiding it like the plague in boss fights due to it hindering way more than it ever helped.

868,136638755.0,1811990,"A very well made game with a wonderful cutesy art style. The player has a lot of control over the outcome of things, which doesn't always happen with deck builders, and there seems to be limitless ways to succeed. I haven't yet seen any bugs, and there haven't been any issues performance-wise, even though my computer isn't the greatest. Overall, I would highly recommend.",1.0
869,136638690.0,1811990,"I want to recommend this game if you enjoy deckbuilders and roguelites, but in its current state I can't promise you will have a great time. The mechanics themselves; the cards, abilities, effects, and companions, all have something really neat, but it's buried under a horribly unbalanced experience. I'm going to start by highlighting what feels incredibly weak on the player's end. 
The hero: Having a choice between three different heroes with random stats and abilities is fine on paper, but Wildfrost's execution of this leaves a lot to be desired. Your hero is frustratingly weak, has long attack cooldowns, and usually an attack stat of MAYBE 3-4. If your hero's death is your losing condition, they should feel more impactful. I know devs might not be the same, but this is the same glaring issue in another game chucklefish published; Wargroove. Another attempt to capture a niche but passionate audience but make lose conditions around losing your commander who has cool abilities and stats, so you are actually given incentive into NOT using them and mainly just keeping them safe. My hero feels weaker than first encounter mobs and can die in two good hits. One of the points of the genre is to start out weak and work your way up, but there is such a thing as too weak to even make it to the first step on the ladder. 
Companions: Cute feature and an added layer of deckbuilding to help guide you to a strong composition. Companions not only taking a card slot but ALSO a turn to put them on the field, is an exercise is design masochism. The enemies will usually have a field of 2-3 enemies, and 3-4 in some later fights. Forcing the player to start out 1v4 is unreasonable given the current card pool and balance state. I think being able to put charms on companions is nice, but I think I would have preferred a level up system where they progress naturally, since I am 4/5 times focusing on putting charms on my much more efficient companions instead of my hero. 
Cards: A basic system that works almost as expected. Again, the turn rotation and action allotment really hurts the experience. I am basically forced to place companions on the board before playing any cards that actually effect my enemies, and even then 4/5 times I am playing cards to keep me from losing instead of bringing me closer to victory. The cards almost feel like an afterthought when you look at Wildfrost's combat through the scope of an autobattler. If heroes could play more than 1 attack card a turn, the deck would feel a lot better to play with. 

Let's talk about enemies and encounters now
Enemies: Battles are randomized in a sense where you will face certain preset compositions picked from a pool. While this can present a challenge in the form that you are facing against a group of enemies that synergize with one another, it is also ball busting at times since they are much more optimized than you, the player can hope to be. Compounded with the fact that their board fields with units without a need to use a turn of action, you are often felt like you are fighting uphill the entire encounter. It doesn't feel rewarding to beat some of these encounters since not only do you not get anything besides currency, they don't feel like true wins since likely had just scrounged up protection for your hero and had cool downs tick at the right times. Enemy cooldown times are also extremely in their favor. If their abilities and attack stats were not so strong, this wouldn't be as big an issue, but whenever even ONE enemy is ready to do their move next I feel like I am forced to either slow them down, kill them somehow, or just accept that I'm making something eat the attack. Enemy compositions will likely appear that are an exact counter to your current build. Again, it wouldn't be so bad if the balance was in a better place. 
Map encounters: Cute idea, but not enough steps and impact on the run. I feel like with how powerful the enemies are, I need at least another rest spot or two to appropriately gear me for the next one. 

Overall, while this game has some decent art and nice groundwork for its mechanics, I can't suggest anyone pay the 20 bucks it costs just to run into the balancing problems a lot of people are facing. If decks, heroes, and companions were more in our control, yeah the difficulty could be managed as you can find a consistent way to overcome the encounters, but when you're thrown a bunch of weak combos that will not get you further than 2-3 battles, it just feels bad. I sincerely hope the developers take some of the feedback to heart and try to tackle the game's balance a little. It would be a shame for a project like this to just fade into the basement tote of generic and unsatisfying deckbuilders.",0.0

Nothing is colorful in this game. Everything is desaturated to the hilt. Everyone lives through misery. There's a stat called happiness. There's no happiness in this game. And there's certainly no emotions properly conveyed in it. I think it should be called a ""misery modifier"". And I'm not sure that the result of ""more happiness in a group"" should be ""increasing the MAXIMUM number of valor points in combat by ONE"". You start most battles with less than the maximum. Ridiculous.

The battle is boring. It's a snooze fest. I see the tactical potential, but it's just so bland and unimmersive, you don't feel like making any progress, it's just repeating a task (engaging, dealing damage) in which the ultimate reward seems to be something like +1 strength which lets you deal......... +1 damage ?

When you get 15 willpower, YOUR CHARACTER RECOVERS FROM DEATH after being killed ---- ONCE PER ENCOUNTER CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT. At 14 willpower ? +1 to Critical Hit. At 16 Willpower ? +1 Critical Hit.

907,136638483.0,1651560,"I often never leave a review, and reserve it only for such an occasion. This game is special. And a dev specifically asked for this as a favor in their Discord, so, ya' gotta do it!

Just to make it easy - great music, fun city builder, a great voice actor/narrator, and a wonderful combination of silly/cartoony and realistic as an art style. And at $15 or $20? Nah, go for it! Give it a try. 

A bit more in-depth - this game is made by a two-man dev team. Which is as mind-blowing as learning Manor Lords is a one-man dev team. With Fabledom, you feel the love they put into their project. There's a story here that will be fleshed out along with the game's development - delivered by game mechanics and a fantastic, sort of nostalgic narrator. The art style is very well crafted, allowing an indie team to seem like they're competing with PIXAR. The game has hints of Banished, Manor Lords, and in some sense, ANNO 1800. The game is calm and easy-going. I saw one comment that was pretty on point - Fabledom feels like how the new Settlers game should have felt.

And my top compliment - this game allows for travelling the map, and does a great mix of cute, cartoony city-building, with later-on added elements of combat. You can eventually build a castle and the surrounding walls, with both footmen and archers. 

Overall, support the game, support their art. Give it a try!

To note though - two negatives. One, as with most city-builders, the game is too easy. Again with other city builders, I doubt there's an End screen. The focus is of course actually building, designing, and decorating a city. But it needs far greater challenges and true game-ending events, if the player isn't focused or strategic. This might be mitigated slightly when combat is introduced soon.

Two - so far, nothing is really new here. You can tell there's love from the devs from this project. It feels like a game from the 90's or early 2000's when devs really, really were trying. I'm reminded of Halo...... But anyway, the game's great and it's fun to play. Buuut, aside from the story line, there's nothing really new here. Hoping to see what happens later on though!",1.0

Get a hero that's less than stellar at the beginning of your run? You might as well fucking start over because it's a 99% chance you're going to be wasting the next 20 minutes trying to build your deck into something functional only to run into a wall that absolutely obliterates whatever deck you've built. When I finally cleared the finish line it didn't feel like it was my skill or knowledge that was able to bring me there - no amount of scrutiny or cleverness or experience got me over those hurdles, it was primarily dependent on luck.

Sure you can sprint towards the enemy in CoD fashion, but they're going to gun you down quick if your team isn't there.

I read a review that said in order to level-up your character, you had to use coins. I don't see that anywhere, you can use the in-game credits which you get just from playing the game & doing daily/weekly challenges. Just an FYI.
I've also seen mention of a Battle Pass, but there doesn't appear to be one active now, so I can't comment on that. All you need to know is that ALL Battle Passes are trash and basically force you to pay to get anything decent from them. So I expect that from this game too.

Is it Pay to Win? I don't play the PvP modes, so I don't now, lol. Is it fun to play without paying anything? Yes.
Here is some quick info:
[list]
[*] Bots can kill you quite easily if you're not careful.
[*] Abilities run on Stamina, so if you run out you can't use them or sprint. - I love this feature.
[*] You have limited revives per person, with Medic having a few more than the others. Keep your Medic alive so they can heal/rez if need be.
[*] Special enemies can be deadly. RPGs, Snipers, Heavies, & Chemists. Chemists are the worst, they throw poison gas that AoEs the area.
[*] I've had the game lock up if you try to interact with too many things too quickly in the menus.
[*] Classes feel fairly balanced, with Medic not doing a whole lot of damage, Sniper doing great with head shots, etc. So you really need the whole team for the most part.
[*] Some maps are pretty unfair. There is one where you infiltrate a lab and go through a decontamination chamber. It fills with poison gas that constantly damages you & has enemies. You need to reach a button to stop it. I have never been part of a team that has stopped it.
[*] On that note, most maps with objectives have two different paths that you randomly get, so it adds a nice bit of variety. For example, on the above map instead of the gas chamber you go through a simple room where you kill guys and activate a switch.

[i]Plantera 2: The Golden Acorn[/i] is a worthy sequel that adds new stuff, but still is as short and cute as its predecessor.  It's an idle game, but it moves [i][b]very[/b][/i] fast.

The basic premise of the game is that you are growing a garden and raising livestock.  Right away you notice a nice-sized oak tree smack in the middle.  This oak is the only thing that you will not be able to move or delete in your side-scrolling garden.

You are asked to click on some butterflies to catch them for coins with which you can buy your first crop, leeks.  Eventually, you will be able to buy berry bushes and other fruit shrubs, fruit trees, and animals, all with drops to collection.  You also can have two production buildings: jam-making machines and windmills.  The buildings don't seem to depend on production chains, though.

Once ripe, ground crops need to be clicked to pull them out of the ground and clicked again to sell.  Fruit on bushes and trees can be clicked when ripe to make them fall, and again to sell.

Fortunately, you are given at the start a Mellow, a cute blue round helper with a bland placid expression and a bag over its shoulder.  You can just let the little guy go pick up fruit, or you can click on stuff to help him.

Hang out with the game, and you will notice various mean critters that show up to mess with your garden.  Magpies steal crops.  Bunnies eat ground crops.  Boars and foxes harass certain animals and make them less productive.  You can click on them a few times to shoo them away.

One tab, the Special tab with the blue star, includes some things to help you with the critters.  Scarecrows and fences help keep the critter population down and help you with offline earnings.  Guard dogs scare off the critters.

The coins you earn double as XP to level up your garden.  New levels give you more helpers, garden expansions to purchase, and unlock new crops and items.

Those levels come FAST!  Spend time with game adding or swapping out crops and expanding the garden, and in just two hours, you'll get 15-20 levels.  A few more hours, and you've unlocked everything.

Another progress bar tracks the acorns you've earned.  These upgrade the oak tree and add things like birdhouses and beehives, and acorns.  Regular brown acorns can be sold for coin, while golden acorns give you the upgrade acorns when sold.

After you've unlocked everything and gotten all the achievements, there's still a couple things left to do.  You can try to see how far the garden can be expanded, for instance.

As you expand the garden further, you might also completely remodel it.

The game gets cluttered and busy pretty quickly.  This is due to the layers used.  Ground crops take one layer, bushes and shrubs another, and trees a third.  Another couple layers are for the special stuff, and yet another for the animals.  Each crop/building layer has limited slots.  The game does make it fairly easy to move or delete stuff.  A layer toggle helps to isolate items to delete or move.  Prices revert to how much you have currently installed, so demolishing everything reverts to starting prices.

With a few more expansions, there's plenty of room to have each crop in isolation if you wish.

You also still keep leveling up after you've unlocked everything.  Crops and animals eventually earn star upgrades with new levels.  It's unclear exactly what this upgrades, though.

You'll also earn more acorns to upgrade the oak.  Acorns can also activate some God Mode powers, mostly to increase Mellow helper speed and crop production speed.

There is, of course, a restart function to start a clean new game, so you can set some challenge for yourself or just revisit the game.

The dev is open to suggestions to what to add to the game, too, so the game might be worth hanging on to for a while.


Graphics are bright and colorful and cheery, with the animals done in a fat, squat, almost cute style.  Music has a relaxing, bouncy vibe.

If you liked the first game, you'll probably like this game, unless the speed at which you  unlock everything puts you off.

If you want an idle game you can actually ""finish,"" instead of numbers rising to infinity, you might like this game.

If you like gardening games, but don't like the hassle of tilling and watering and producing stuff yourself, you might like this game.

932,136665133.0,1364020,"Incredible game but will take some time to fully grasp and has some places to improve. But it is Early Access so I’m looking forward to see how this game progresses!

Some things to note:

The tutorial is serviceable, it teaches you the movement controls and combat controls well enough, but it’ll take you some time to get used to unless you’ve played other games with similar space mechanics like Space Engineers or Hardspace: Shipbreaker. Something I feel it lacks is letting you know about how interactive the maps are. Until I bumped into something with a button prompt, I had no idea I could open/close airlocks, pressurize sections, or ride cables. The tutorial should’ve at least had an example of this because it is really cool.

The class customization and the classes themselves lend to a lot of variety but there are some classes that tend to be more popular than others. Some special ordinances are clearly better than others and I can see some balancing rework being needed for some.

The actual combat is just downright awesome and it really is a tactical space shooter. 3D tactics feels both empowering and threatening as flanking maneuvers are so much more dynamic. Combat is intense and the map design blends close quarters combat with large open combat very well.

Speaking of map design. They’re some of the best I’ve seen. They are molded perfectly to their respective game modes. The only problem I could see is sometimes spawn locations can drop you in right on top of the enemy if they’re at your spawn. I didn’t suffer any spawn camping but I can definitely see it happening.

I saw other reviews talking about bugs or bad connection, and they very well may have experienced that, but I didn’t experience any kind of problems like that. My game kept up good connection, consistent frame rate, no graphical errors, or anything.

Overall I highly recommend it and look forward to seeing this game grow. I hope it gets the love and recognition it deserves. Hope to see you out there!",1.0

Another absolute masterpiece from D'Avekki Studios! Murderous Muses is a first-person supernatural murder mystery game where you must discover who killed Mordechai Grey by investigating portraits that you hang throughout the gallery. The portraits come to life and give snippets of information which you use to discover the actual killer among the 6 suspects. This isn't a premade story on rails like many FMV games. It's a first-person adventure where you have to figure out what goes where and how, or risk missing out on important information. And every playthrough is randomized with a random murderer, evidence and environments! No two playthroughs look or play the same, SO much changes between playthroughs. You can easily play it several times and get significantly different experiences. 

The game takes place over a couple days, each having a distinct day and night time. During the day, you receive new paintings and place them across the gallery, discovering the history of the area and important lore about locations.  At night, the gallery comes to life and you can investigate the paintings for information.   

I really like how it doesn't hold your hand. You get a little tutorial and then you're let loose in the gallery. You need to do a bit of sleuthing to figure out how the mechanics all work. And if you blow through the days you can easily miss major information. You might not win your playthrough if you mess up enough, which I love. FMV games are almost always too easy, but Murderous Muses actually asks you to use your brain and powers of deduction. And since each playthrough is unique, you take what you've learned about the game to make your next run better while experiencing a fresh killer and set of evidence. 

Lots of little easter eggs and secrets and the cool collectible room ensure I'll play this quite a few times through. There is a ton of lore to be found and many ways to approach the Muses. My first playthrough was about 4 hours, but I'm piecing through everything I can get my fingers on, YMMV. Even when you've discovered the killer, there's still plenty to uncover...there's a lot more going on than just the murder. It should take 4ish playthroughs to get all the achievements.

I find Murderous Muses an amazing title, through and through. The acting, writing and soundtrack are overall incredible, it's replayable and SO engaging. I can't get over how much changes between playthroughs, and I'm absolutely enthralled with Mirlhaven. I can't recommend this enough. And if you enjoy this and other FMV games, make sure to check out D'Avekki's other titles. Every game is a masterpiece, they all play differently and they're all in the same universe!

964,136667838.0,1811990,"The game is fun and beneath the balancing issues is a interesting deck builder. But I have to agree with most negative reviews here. I LOVED the demo but what I think this game desperately need is a more divers path of enemies. For the most part you can make some pretty busted builds as usual for a rogue-like, but enemy encounters can just outright counter your deck strategy very usually since the game does not offer much diversity with deck creativity. If you could at least have two options in the path as to what enemy you are to face, I could enjoy myself without the frustration of praying as to WHO I will face. 
So prepare to be leaning HARD into the RNG luck of not ONLY what you get but what enemies you will face. You either synergize or die.",0.0

968,136667049.0,1811990,"This game has a lot going for it, and a lot that could be improved. Wildfrost nails the art, mechanics, acension system, UX and  ease of understanding. Everything follows a consistent logic which although it can take many tries to learn the specifics it has never left me feeling like they made a mistake. 

I would say that the game falls flat when it comes to consistency between runs. RNG is expected for the roguelike genre but in this case it affects every aspect of the game including the most important of your 2 starting units, the leader, which has to remain on the board the entire fight and if it dies its game over. All fights come as one of 2 versions, with a different set of enemies for each. The issue with this is that they can be WILDLY different in how tough they are. The events between fights are also mostly random - this is alright as the events are balanced enough and the shop events even things out because it's never required to buy a card at a shop, and the coins can be saved up at bad shops until you find one with the items you want.

By far the most aggravating RNG comes at the very beginning of the run with the choice of 1 of 3 randomly generated heroes. Some of the heroes are leagues stronger than others. It makes a huge difference in getting a run off the ground. Unfortunately, resetting after having a bad hero selection counts as a loss so if you care about winstreaks or win rates this adds frustration. I prefer not to start scum but winning feels way more achievable when I start with a good hero. 
This actually gets WORSE with the ascension perks as you only have one hero available from each faction. The starting faction is the most powerful, the 2nd one is good, and the 3rd faction is the worst. So although I will prefer using one of the factions I do not have much of a choice when the one hero from it sucks. Factions determine your starting deck and a large amount of the available cards during the run, which makes this very important.

The biggest RNG in fights occurs at the first boss fight. It spawns with either the King Moko or the 2 tall Mecha boss. King moko is essentiatlly a 7-turn death timer, in which you have to kill the boss before he attacks or else he wipes out your entire board. On top of that he has 60 health which is very high at that point in the game, so the only way to beat him is through having units attack him enough times that the attack bonus he gives builds up and is enough to chew through his health. The mecha boss on the other hand only had 18 health in the first phase, and 15 health in the second phase, and does 2 damage. The attack is super easy to tank in the second phase and 18 health is only twice as much as the regular enemies. I don't mind the fight being difficult, but the variation in balancing is laughable.

Now for the reasons why I like the game. I'll start with listing specific mechanics outside of the basics you're taught in the tutorial and through text:

combat order goes top down, from the inside of the board outward starting on the enemies side and then letting the players side go through actions. All effects tick after attacks have happened.

Noomlings make cards completely free to play, as such if you have multiple cards with noomlings in your hand you can play all of them without using your turn

Companions can be put into reserve (you still have them but they're not in your deck for battle) at any time, with a limit of 3 companions going into battle

All effects are useful on every unit type, including bosses. This is handy because it means effect synergies can't get hard countered, and remain viable in each fight. The only exception is that some boss and non-boss units have snow resist, which means that they can only have 1 snow stacked at one time. Snow is an effect which delays that units attack timer by the amount of snow, this stops the player from being able to prevent a bosses attack entirely. This is different to slay the spire, which has units which are immune to different types of effects. 

Mechanics like 'sacrificing' where friendly cards have to be killed to gain a bonus are not treated any differently from any other way of a card dying - in one instance I had a card which applies 4 overburn get sacrificed by another unit, and it ended up applying the overburn to my own unit, killing it. Heroes are also treated like any companions by other cards because my own hero got killed when another card triggered its sacrifice on the row it was in.

Why do I like the game, even with those issues I've described? I still find a lot of fun in the strategy that comes with every decision made - whether to go with what's best in the next fight, or try to find a broken synergy 2 fights from now. To build a good deck it's always a good idea to have more than one strong unit and synergy because many of the fights test decks in specific areas. There is one fight where the enemies all have a lot of block shielding which blocks individual instances of damage. If you used a strong single damage dealer to get through previous fights it adds a lot of challenge because the attacks of that damage dealer will only remove one block, the same as if it did 1. To defeat the enemies you need either a strong defensive setup which lets you chip away at the opponent's blocks or many fast attacking units to destroy their threatening units quickly.

The most fun I've had with this game was naming my cards and messing around with OP charm combos, when I beat the game with my leader called 'YOUR MOTHER'. Now she resides at the final boss fight every time, with all of the broken combos which I created with those units alongside her. Every time I've gotten back to that point since I have lost to YOUR MOTHER I'm determined to build a more OP deck so I can see what happens when I beat the fight for a second time.",1.0
969,136666865.0,1811990,"I feel mixed about this game, but right now the user reviews sit at 60% and I don't really think it deserves that.

I kinda forced my way through the game Slay The Spire, but I got all the achievements so I like to think I'm good at these kind of games.

People say this game is badly balanced but I don't agree with that.  The runs are just short so every fight needs to feel lethal.  That being said I do think this game FEELS random.  There is just so much going on in the game that it's super difficult to keep up with and I found myself not understanding how I lost.  Feels like sometimes the stars will align and either you'll just randomly kill the boss or the enemies will just randomly kill you.

I don't even have 6 hours and I already stumbled my way into my first victory.  After that the character you won with becomes the new boss, the game lets you activate special modifiers for a run, and I still have a lot of cards to unlock.

Notable innovations to the card-battler genre from an artistic and mechanical standpoint. Board positioning is essential, as is paying attention to the minute details of enemy effects and attack patterns.

This game is extremely punishing, and for me that is very motivating to keep playing. This is not a game where you can afford to zone out, and it holds tension even in the early battles of each run.

However, there are some changes that would probably make the game more fun. I think a system of re-rolling hero selections would be nice, because it's not fun to feel the need to play a hero that is almost identical to one you played in your previous run. There's some needlessly difficult interactions such as Monch insta-killing your avatar. It made me laugh, but it's really not necessary to have as many small ""gotchas"" like this to keep the game challenging.

I'm also not sure that forcing card selection from chests is necessary. Similar games such as Slay the Spire let the player opt to take nothing at all, which is often preferable than making an off-synergy pick. The large hand-size and bell re-draw system does already mitigate the drawbacks of having a dud in your deck, but I think the game is challenging enough that it could support players running leaner, meaner strategies earlier.

Or, as much as I like the injury mechanic, maybe just remove it or make it reduce the creature's stats incrementally rather than by half? 

Who knows without play-testing, but I'd consider some graceful ways to slightly re-balance.",1.0

+ Only a couple loading screens. Some levels fade into one another. 
+ Talking about levels, it deviates from the regular 'convoy' theme at times and gives you trains, planes, exploding barrel trucks and even the sandworm from Dune. No, I'm not kidding. There is a giant sand worm. 
+ The grapple hook is free to use with any weapon. Nothing beats grappling to a group of enemies, letting the minigun rip and tear them apart! 
+ The fast paced, metal soundtrack. 
+ The enemies are styled like punk / post apocalyptic goons. 
+ The easily affordable price. 
+ One of the achievements for falling off the train is called 'Follow The Damn Train, CJ!'
+ Sometimes the enemies kill themselves by jumping and missing a moving truck, which is very kind of them. And funny. 

Things I Don't Like: 
- The pixel style of graphics: The indie shooter's unimpressive go-to for art style. Dusk. Nightmare Reaper. Cultic. Ultrakill. Gloomwood. And now MeatGrinder. It's just my preference. I don't like it and I grew up playing Star Wars Dark Forces 1+2! Although, this one is actual 3D all the way through. 
- Within 28 minutes I had a lot of repeated voice lines from the protagonist. I even turned down the frequency in which he speaks, but it didn't stop him from saying 'I LOVE THIS SONG' every time the music changes. 

Overall, an absolutely killer title for the price. 
And I totally recommend listening to the Mad Max Fury Road chase music if you get bored of the metal.

The meta-progression is very well implemented and allows you to push further and further every single run, You will get crushed by new foes over and over again until you adapt. But not at any point frustration will kick in. Every run allows you to play a completely different style and with the different tribes you'll have even more variety.

Every single encounter could end your run, leaving you on the edge, while your cute creatures fight other more angry cute creatures.

1010,136668319.0,1811990,"I was a bit turned off from getting the game, since it's currently sitting at an unsteady 60% review ratio. Now I will say the game isn't ridiculously hard as it sounded like it would be, but there is a lot going on and if you miss an effect that an enemy has or misalign your characters, it could result in a bit of a mess or injuries to a character or two!

But the fact that one of the more popular reviews states that they had 20 runs in 3 hours, and had somehow managed to die in the first battle is shocking! In my 3 hours I had 4 solid runs and made it to the third zone, with each run being a different unique setup than the last. I made a mistake or two in a couple runs which didn't ultimately end them and still did alright.

King Moko specifically was rather daunting, but I made it through the fight by quickly bursting him down with debuffs and sun rods. However the third zone though with wild boars I fucked up real fast and attacked one with my leader and died instantly. That, while frustratingly silly, was totally on me and forgot he'd just counter attack twice. 

Otherwise I played at a bit of a slower more meticulous pace, paying attention to enemies that had effects like giving armor to other enemies, or the enemy that causes aimless on your party and targeted them with cards rather than depending solely on my party. Switching people around to avoid big hits and using weak dummy deployables to tank big hits was very important for fights.

I'm not a fan of card games at all (Slay the Spire being the ONLY other one I play), but it isn't impossible to get into. There are a lot of ways to approach fights with cards, and if you don't figure them out you may struggle a bit with the game since it's less straight forward than Slay the Spire since you have a field of characters to manage that attack independently of played cards like the freeze attacks and such.

TLDR: The game has a lot of charm, the artstyle is lovely, and the music is great. There's a decent variety of build potential with cards, and it is super satisfying to figure out what works with what. It rewards patient play and a bit of experimenting. However, some enemy effects (eg. causing aimless to your party) can be frustrating since the fight partially is out of your control and you have to rely on in hand cards and a bit of luck on top of that.

Overall I'd rate it positively, but a couple battles can prove to be frustrating but it isn't anywhere what I expected from some of the reviews and the 60% rating. Of course it's still an early review so it should be taken with a grain of salt and ideally it could use some adjustments too.",1.0

There's a wide range of different species that can be grown, from fruit trees to flowers and vegetables. There's also a great variety of animals that can be raised, such as chickens, cows, and sheep. Additionally, there's a large number of items to unlock, such as gardening equipment and farm decorations.

The gameplay in Plantera 2 is very fun and addictive. The game starts with a small and simple farm, but as the player earns more money, they can expand the farm and purchase new plants and animals. There's also the possibility of hiring workers to help care for the animals and plants. However, as the farm grows, it also becomes more difficult to manage, making the game challenging.

The graphics in Plantera 2 are excellent, with a lot of attention to detail. The characters and animals are well-designed and the colors are bright and cheerful. The soundtrack is relaxing and helps create a peaceful and pleasant atmosphere.

Although I enjoyed Plantera 2 very much, there are some weaknesses in the game. The lack of a plot or story can make the game a bit monotonous and without a clear goal. Additionally, the gameplay can become repetitive after a while, especially if the player has already unlocked most of the plants and animals.

Overall, Plantera 2 is a fun and engaging game with many plants, animals, and items to unlock. While the lack of a plot may be somewhat disappointing for some players, the gameplay itself is very satisfying and addictive.

You can see tracers and the Sun reflected off your helmet. Your character breathes heavily and you can hear the oxygen rushing out of your suit. Sound doesn't travel in space, and the game is starkly quiet as a result (but still full of rich sound design) I have spent the last hour in game goggling at my surroundings with my headphones at full volume to appreciate what this game has going on. It's really well done in all aspects, including in the menus.
-The game's visual design is great- the UI/HUD elements and ingame assets fit really well with the theme and everything goes together nicely. It remains to be seen where cosmetics will be taken (and I really hope against all odds they stick to the theme of high-tech space). 
-The gunplay is extremely satisfying when it's flowing well- when everything clicks it feels really well done. AAA quality for sure.
-The movement is mostly well considered and feels very fluid despite your character being in a clunky spacesuit. The grapple and boost mechanic are great for getting around.
-I appreciate the small aesthetic flairs- the weapon animations are nearly fantastic throughout (with a few small janks here and there), and I am a big fan of the character flairs given to each class. 
-Stability is great so far. Have not experienced any frame drops, lags, stutters, or crashes (thank UE4)

CONS:
-The translation quality to English is very poor at this time. A few things remain in Chinese, and the menu elements are pretty poorly translated throughout. The entire game needs a thorough pass by a trained localization team. 
-The HUD (ESPECIALLY the customization menu) has some information but is lacking many critical details. I saw a community guide up earlier that EXPLAINED each side pod's function, which is notably lacking from the game itself. Good luck trying to figure out what anything does at this point.
-A lot of gameplay elements are questionably balanced and don't seem to serve a function at this time. For example, there is a medic class but there isn't really a tangible purpose to healing your teammates as everyone is very dispersed around the map- and it's really difficult to land the healing device (?) anyways. 
-Some QoL stuff is missing, including what is mentioned above. You can't exit out of a match in the pre-game lobby, and the pre-round timer is too long.
-Some of the maps are not very good. The crash site one invites a lot of pot shots from across the map and a single choke point (a choke point in space! can you believe that?) contains a lot of the fighting.
-Engagement distances are kinda funky as CQC is rare- it's weird to figure out where the shotguns and SMGs will be effective compared to longer-distance weapons.
-For some people, the unlocked axes of movement could probably cause motion sickness.
-Some aspects of the movement are questionable- the landed state is clunky to move to and from, and the momentum brake isn't so useful when you can stop as is. Stick to the grapple for now.
-The tutorials are adequate but leave out lots of helpful info. See above regarding the lack of info in menus.
-The game desperately needs a region lock, and maybe more servers. I am playing against China/SEA players with 300+ ping on a regular basis.


NEUTRAL:
-A lot of the cosmetics in the game so far are directed towards a Chinese audience. Expect a lot of the items ingame right now to seem a bit strange out of context.
-I have heard some reservations from others about the Tencent anticheat but I would wager Tencent has as much data from me as Denuvo and EAC at this point. Download at your peril!!!

OVERALL:

The game is not anywhere near a finished state, which is to be expected in Early Access. I am still really excited to see Boundary improve over time, and I think it has the bones of a very solid, high skill gap, beloved competitive/casual FPS. The developers will undoubtedly encounter rampant sinophobia in a western audience and the challenge will be to warm people up to the unusual concept of space combat, but even in an early state, I can see a lot of love and polish in Boundary. 


Verdict: Maybe wait awhile to purchase as the game is pretty unpolished on Day 1. The price is more than reasonable for what's on offer at $25. I will come back to update this review as the game changes.",1.0

I love the narrator and the art style is so cute. I like that it has all of the foundation and mechanics from most city builder games, but has more of a cozy gaming feel where you can just sit back and relax while designing your fairytale kingdom. 

Scrolling through the kingdom can get very slow and laggy if you unlock a lot of the map, but that may be my computer not being very good. I’m really excited to see more of the world map interactions with other kingdoms. Disappointed to find out that castles and a other food source buildings won’t be available for a while, but I rather have early access and be here through the process than wait for the game to be fully done. 

Overall this game is so much fun. I was able to put in a lot of hours first day until I finished all early access content…. And then an hour or two more after that. And in excited to check out the creative mode and build some monstrous cities. Devs should be proud.

You can play it grabbing the table, OR moving the girl with the sticks. The ""grab controls"" method is very original but difficult. It's based to the old labytinth+ball games mechanics. The other method, I'd call it ""sticks controls"" method, is way better from a ""gameplay"" perspective (and I feel good with triggers for ""world"" rotation).
As far as I played, I've had a good fun. Some items interactions are a little ""clunky"", however the in-game puzzles are cool and the exploration is interesting. 
Good game, for a very  low price.

1031,136669888.0,1968710,"My immediate response to the ending was ""NO! [i]NO![/i] THAT CAN'T BE IT! [i][b]THERE MUST BE MORE![/b][/i]""

So yes, I liked the game so much that my biggest issue is how short it is. Unlike [u]Portal[/u], [u]MEATGRINDER[/u] doesn't really have the writing or story—nay, not even the pretence for a thrilling climax. Thrilling set pieces, most certainly, each one better than the last, but the game doesn't so much reach a satisfying finish as it does just end. There are a couple of cool bosses in the game but we don't get one very last boss to wrap things up, like a giant robot spider using tanks as skates.

But those set pieces really are good, I must say. From the very second level, jumping between trucks and flinging away bandits running and jumping at you never stops being fun, and then they just keep introducing new elements in each level to make it so much more fun and exciting! Having said that, while the final two levels are visually striking and dynamic, enemy placement is repeated and the gameplay loop doesn't flow as well so shooting enemies isn't particularly fun in them. However, as the levels are pretty damn short and it IS an amazing visual spectacle, it's not a problem at all as you'll only go through them once anyway.

I have a few more issues:
[list]
    [*]Not all weapons are created equally. The minigun feels and sounds rather underpowered compared to everything else and it heats up way too quickly. Also, there's really no reason to use the pistols once you've gotten the second weapon.
    [*]Hard Mode is, ironically, too hard. I think it's fine to punish the player more for falling on the road but a one-hit kill is far too unforgiving when the game is so chaotic that what you're standing on can just leave you far too suddenly and get you killed, or car placements are too far spread out that it's impossible to advance. 
    [*]The game is... visually weird? When enemies are close to me, it's hard to register a lot. I kick at them but there's little in the way of visceral feedback that tells me I've actually done it apart from the enemy suddenly not being in front of me anymore. Same goes for when I'm shooting them with the pistols. I guess this combines with the minigun issue of weapons lacking solid feedback, which could be remedied by sound effects.
    [*]I get you're inspired by [u]ULTRAKILL[/u], what with the graphics and that whole three-line intro bit at the start, but those things are just cheesy. Those things aren't what make [u]ULTRAKILL[/u] great and having those elements don't make you [u]ULTRAKILL[/u]. This game sets itself apart in so many wonderful ways while being alike in so many wonderful ways so those things just baffle me, really.
[/list]
Overall, though, I loved [u]MEATGRINDER[/u]. The sheer creativity and thrill behind every moment of the game makes me very excited for what Vampire Squid do next. I WILL say that, while I can appreciate a game focusing on gameplay over story, there's no reason why they can't intersect and work off each other. All games are enriched with context and boomer shooters are no different; [u]Metal: Hellsinger[/u]'s one example of this and even [u]DOOM[/u] 2016 uses the themes of the original [u]Doom[/u]'s tropes as good storytelling devices, from the Doom Slayer's violent reactions to everything and his lack of speaking. 

I'm not going to ask for long cutscenes and exposition. This game is, after all, about flow, and cutscenes like that would be just as flowbreaking as Hard Mode with all the deaths on the road. But surely the gameplay itself could tell the story; voice lines from your avatar that aren't pop culture references, enemy designs and voice lines, and even the set pieces themselves could result from decisions made by everyone involved in this crazy imminent pile-up. All the same, this was really cool.",1.0
1032,136669699.0,1567000,"Just finished the game and gotta say it has a style. It's not pretending to copy modern shooters or create new mechanics. It's just let you follow the flow and get the vibes with absolutely fantastic level art and music.
""Crazy"" atmospehere of the game and all that inspiration from classic artists and sculpturs supported by music which let you escape from reality and forget about all others needs.
I think a good advice on clearing levels is to follow the pace of the evironment - do not hurry and look around you. There's no need to run it as much fast as possible rather get that ""tone"" of the game and just enjoy!

1047,136671218.0,1811990,"I'll echo what some of the other positive reviews are saying: a lot of the negative reviews are just a skill issue. Period. I think that there are legitimate criticisms to be made with the game, but my god. As of writing this review the game is sitting at a 60% review score and that is just simply unfair. One of the top reviews as my writing this complains that they died multiple times in the first fight in the run and that they had 20 runs in 3 hours. Having played around 5 hours myself, and having no prior experience with deckbuilders in the past, I can honestly say I have no fucking clue how that dude managed to lose the first fight enough times that they felt it necessary to note it in their review. 

The game is challenging. It is, sometimes frustrating, but I can honestly say that most of my deaths have been because I made a mistake, and I was playing too fast. Some reviews are complaining about needing some crazy luck or needing a perfect build, and that is just not at all true. I think maybe one of my runs was extremely lucky, and it wasn't the run that made it to the end. With smart play, making the most of your resources, and attention, you can make the most out of the vast majority of your runs. I can not emphasize enough that the reviews blasting the game about horrific balance and extreme difficulty are likely playing too quickly, just generally, but certainly in battles (once again, as a complete newcomer to the genre, no clue how one would manage 20 runs in 3 hours). And to say that the different enemy types require an exact ""answer"" is just flat out wrong. A wide array of strategies are entirely viable, and I've had great success with several, frankly entirely unoptimized builds. The game requires careful thought and each decision. It isn't ""impossibly difficult,"" it just requires patience and for you to not rush through every turn. I don't mean to outright attack other reviewers, but I worry the review score will drive away prospective new players. Most of the negative reviews are severely misguided, and clearly aren't engaging in good faith with the mechanics the game provides.

I can't say it is perfect, but I can say I've had a great amount of fun with it, and the current review score is criminal. It could absolutely do with some tuning, I can't disagree there, there are certainly some cards that just feel worthless, but to say that the majority are unusable is laughable. There is a legitimate criticism to be made in the games draw system, as it at no point informs you that you will be able plan out your future hands by looking at your deck and your discard pile. This is an extremely important mechanic, as it eliminates a rather large random element, and I only discovered it on accident.

The design, both visual and sound, are delightful, and full of little touches that show that the devs clearly had a great deal of passion for this game, and a great deal of enjoyment for it. Please, please don't be swayed by some of the less charitable reviews. The game is more than worth your time, and I don't regret my purchase for a second. I rarely if ever write reviews, but I felt I had to for this game. If I had to give a rating, it would be sitting much close to 85%. There are legitimate criticisms to be made with this, in terms of some design aspects and balance, but it's hard to have that discussion when the majority of the negative reviews I've seen have been made seemingly in bad faith by people that grew frustrated with a game that demanded their attention.

This game is not ""impossibly hard."" This game is not ""all rng."" It requires time, attention, and a great deal of player input for every decision. Saying that there is very little the player can influence or do is a flat out lie. I have saved what seemed like unwinable positions and lost what seemed like a sure thing, entirely on my own competence.

First off, the visuals and the music are absolutely top notch. To the point of sometimes distracting you form the actual gameplay to just appreciate them. The tactical nature of the combat with the positioning of your units feels very rewarding when you begin to understand it. Also, the way you constantly keep unlocking new stuff via small achievements is great.

Now is the game hard? Yes, a lot, but It's certainly not unbeatable. I don't know why people are so focused on winning the video game that they can't appreciate the process of loosing, figuring out why, learning from it, and trying new strategies.

1077,136670663.0,"17,980,101,798,020","Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection Vol. 1 is a compilation of the first three games in the Mega Man Battle Network series, which are action-RPGs that combine real-time combat with grid-based strategy. The games follow the adventures of Lan and his NetNavi MegaMan.EXE, who fight against various cyber-threats in a futuristic world where everything is connected to the internet. The games feature a unique battle system that allows the player to customize MegaMan's abilities with various chips and programs, and also switch between different battle styles that affect his stats and skills. The games also have a rich story that explores themes such as friendship, family, identity, and morality.

The Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection Vol. 1 is a great way to experience these classic games that have aged well and still offer a lot of fun and challenge. The collection also includes some bonus features such as concept art, music player, and online netbattling and trading. The games have been enhanced with HD graphics as well as E-Reader patch cards (in Volume 2) which were previously only available in Japan. The collection is a must-have for fans of the series, as well as anyone who enjoys tactical JRPGs with a twist.",1.0

This collection is great and unlike some collections/ remasters you get much more than just the games:
Artwork, Music Player, MegaMan HIMSELF and much more all these extras make this collection much more charming.

As for the games themselves they are quite unique ARPGs with Cardgame like mechanics.
I love the characters and the stories are better than one would think. 
Personally of this collection MegaMan Battle Network 3 is my favorite game, but they all held up great.

I never was able to play these games with friends so I'm super happy they included online with this, can't wait to try it out.",1.0
1082,136673430.0,1798010,"Even before playing this I was pretty likely recommending it. The games themselves are good as it is, but Capcom went the extra mile and gave us online functionality and even made sure things like event-only distributions are accounted for here. The packed gallery and BGM player along with a nice suite of options means that this is THE way to play Battle Network.

Unlike the X Collection or the Classic Legacy Collection, the general change in style between 1-3 and 4-6 mean splitting this up into 2 volumes is definitely a smart move. Even with how the game changes between the two halves, it never truly feels like 1 through 3 are obsolete games. They still have a lot of good to offer and are totally worth picking up, but I can see why some people would stick to either Volume 1 or Volume 2 on their own.

As for the games themselves, what's there to say that hasn't been said already? Battle Network 1 is rough around the edges in a lot of ways, but the core ideas are there for a very fun game. You might want to play it first if you feel like you're not going to appreciate how much changed over time, or you might want to come back to it when you've seen why people love this series so much. Just bring a map with you because getting lost can happen often.

2 improves on just about everything that people had issue with in 1. It's still got some issues, but it definitely feels like a much more cohesive product with a refined look and feel. I remember this also having way more bonkers online than any other game in the series, with so many cheese strats and lopsided balance that can be fun, but may not be for you.

3 is definitely the peak of the series. It's not downhill, but everything just seems to come together perfectly for 3. Further fine tuning to the gameplay, the addition of the Navi Customizer to let you enhance Mega Man in all manner of ways, slightly better balance among the Style Change forms, and a meatier story that gives us a suitable finale for what can be considered the first ""arc"". The version split, while definitely a way to cash in on the Pokemon trend in some ways, does have some viability in Battle Network, with a unique boss in either version and some unique chips in each library. However, Punk is only actually in Blue, since Blue is actually just the enhanced version of Battle Network 3 made to look like a separate version. Tut tut, Capcom. At least later games actually are built with version differences in mind.

Battle Network is probably a cornerstone franchise for the GBA, and for many is going to be how they first found Mega Man. It's great to have them in this form, including online functionality, and even if you're not into Mega Man, you'd be getting into a rock solid action RPG with a unique setting and unique mechanics that has a ton of content worth sinking your teeth into.",1.0

1103,136673090.0,1527950,"A good game I would not recommend.
The camp building is fun, the crafting is fun, I do like the profession minigames actually!

It is a lot like battle brothers and incredibly charming, I love a lot about this.
Why do I not recommend it? Because difficulty is done poorly in my opinion.
What do I mean? Well, let me explain.
Generally, challenge is a curve, while your strength goes steadily up, most games start out very hard, you become stronger and the curve swings down, you have reached a point where your new skills let you feel powerful. Then slowly the curve swings back up and new opponents and challenges approach, which allow you to truly be put to the test with the things you learned. Then you slowly gain new skills again and it becomes easier, so you feel rewarded about your progression.
This loop is how most games work.

Now, wartales instead is... two straight lines overlapping. You level up? All enemies instantly level up. You gain a new member? All enemy parties are suddenly bigger.
This is both immersion breaking and makes combat a bit of a slog. Battle brothers did this too, but to a far, far less noticable degree, where enemies felt like they slowly ramped up and when you got stronger there were still plenty of weak and fragile bandits.
Here suddenly even the refugees are 12 man parties swarming you like they think they're zerg, when they started out as 3 man. This means every combat is the same level of challenge, you never feel rewarded for getting stronger, because you know combat is just getting harder instead, so instead of saying ""yay I got a new great member!"" you think ""god damn it, now I'll have to fight 12 enemies every fight... I hope they don't all get the buff that makes them do 5% hp every attack"".

There is no reward for stronger, because enemies are always scaled up to your level, in fact it would almost seem that the more I advance, the weaker I get, as enemies scale even harder. It's... not very fun and it turns combat into a slog.
Battle brother does it very well, where enemies don't really get stronger, but gradually stronger parties with new enemies show up.
They don't do that here, it's just level 5 refugees with torches burning you down, and super elite bandits.
It's still the same bandits as in the early game, but now they're super boosted and there's 20 of them.

I want to recommend this game, but they just need to rework the way they do enemy scaling. Because like this? Well, the only result is always gonna be an immersion breaking slog of combat.
Improving your mercenary group should let you have some moments of victory.

Because when every battle is the same difficulty, and you never feel like you are growing stronger, and you're always fighting the same enemies scaled exactly to be as strong as you, every battle is completely forgetable and you stop caring about progressing.

You have some amazing systems, in my opinion the way battle actually plays out is very good, but the scaling is too much. When it comes to enemies and scaling, learning from battle brothers might be a godsent.

- Amazing music.
- Lovable cast of characters, both friends and foes alike.
- Beautiful locations, both in Lan's world and in Mega Man's.
- Fun gimmicks per each entry, such as Cross Fusion, Double Soul, etc.
- Amazing pixel art.
- An overall very exciting and enjoyable adventure.

Cons:
- Random battle shenanigans being a wee bit too frequent for my taste. (At least for MMBN1. Been a long time since I've played these games, so I don't quite remember if the rest are as... Saturated with random battles as MMBN1 is.)

That gripe aside, its a fun game, and the sequels fix a lot of past issues.

Battle Network 2: adds so much more compared to BN1. More areas to explore Battle system tweaked for the better, and the story is pretty good.

Battle Network 3:
This is in my opinion the best BN game. Battle system has been expanded upon greatly, it introduces the customization system to make your play style your own. (a few complaints where you have to use certain upgrades for specific parts in the story) Speaking of, the story is my favorite of the 3. And the post game has so much do do.

To begin, I don't think the game is polished enough to justify a RM 50 cost. It still has some bugs. Omnem does fix them quickly though once reported, so it should fine given time. Single Player is fun for a bit, but it runs into some issues. Karmic Years do not decay and the amount you get from getting sieged is basically none(2 common years,really), making ai allies requires prefect ideological alignment(may get fixed when crises update comes out), and some stats like accident related deaths aren't really clear on what they do. Influence gain is way too slow for rapid expansion, even on the most forgiving settings, and it can be hard to find resources needed all the way to late game.
At least karmic years can be fully disabled in SP. That said, there are a few suggestions I would like to give.

A general resource mapmode filtered to a player specified resource as well as on nations for trade would reduce frustration on finding goods wanted by players.
Allow players to set up their own lobbies with custom settings, and add some additional settings, like guaranteed resources and karmic year decay over long periods of peace or after a set amount of time.
Clear up some stats on what they do exactly.
Add some way to increase influence gain, both in game and in pre game settings.
Make the ai easier to ally via multiple methods.

The game can be played with a fixed set and a randomized set. The former is good for understanding the views of the author and can be metagamed, but the sp victory requirements that scale with time suggests that the latter is the intended set. This is fine, a small adjustment for the fixed set or even sliders would be nice though.

The game does have a charm of sorts despite its flaws. I enjoyed reading all the flavor text as well as the events, and finding ways to break the game is enjoyable. Omnem does a pretty good job on expressing them self within the dialog and has heart put into it.

I would carefully recommend the game, but be might not be for you if reading isn't a thing you like to do.

The community, while small compared to AAA games, is extremely passionate about the game and want it to succeed.  While I hope it does too, there are some lingering issues I've been hearing since the initial playtests came out.  

I am more than content leveling up operators and weapons and ignoring most issues as the game's atmosphere, graphics, and music are all incredible and I'm generally easy to please when it comes to early access games.  There's truly no other game like this and the level of immersion had been a huge focus of the team.  What I'm hoping will become the focus are some of the lingering issues I mentioned - few modes, server issues + ping exploits, lack of explanation for most items, and a less than stellar UI.  Now that the game is out and the team is very aware of these, we'll just have to wait and see.  Many of the complaints I've seen in Discord and Discussions - LOTS of spawn camping, snipers being overpowered, bad hit reg, poor aiming - haven't really been my experience.  Every competitive FPS game has similar issues and not to sound like a jerk, but most of these can be combated by changing playstyles and/or getting better at the game.  You can only block so many times in Dark Souls before the need to roll is made clear, you know?

I've enjoyed many games that unfortunately never made it (Hawken, Dirty Bomb, Lawbreakers, Radical Heights, and Last Man Standing to name a few) and I truly hope Boundary doesn't make that list.

[b]+ Embark on a journey towards sainthood in the dark and eerie world of Stigmata of Sacrilege!ヽ(´• ω •`)、[/b]

[h1][b][1] Intro [/b][/h1]
Stigmata of Sacrilege is an action RPG game that follows the journey of Sophie, a beautiful orphan who is blessed with a sign from the Lord that she is fated to become the next saint. The game is filled with many enemies and bosses, all with unique attack patterns. In order to become a saint, Sophie must overcome her trials for sainthood and seek blessings from various holy sites that have become dungeons. 

[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]

What sets Stigmata of Sacrilege apart from other adventure games is the inclusion of adult content, which can be unlocked through a special H-patch provided by the publisher. This content enhances the value of the game, adding a sensuous and sensual element to the already engaging gameplay.

The gameplay in Stigmata of Sacrilege is fast-paced and challenging, with many enemies and bosses that require careful strategy to defeat. The combat system is well-designed, and the game offers a wide variety of weapons and abilities that players can use to take down their foes. The game also features a leveling system, which allows players to improve their character's stats and abilities as they progress through the game.

One of the highlights of Stigmata of Sacrilege is its visuals. The game's graphics are stunning, with detailed environments and beautifully rendered character models. The game's sound design is also excellent, with a haunting soundtrack that perfectly complements the game's dark and eerie atmosphere.

The story of Stigmata of Sacrilege is intriguing and engaging, and the game provides a rich and detailed backstory for its characters. The game is set in a dark and eerie world, where many devious and nefarious demons stand in Sophie's way. The main character, Sophie, is a sympathetic and likable protagonist, and her journey towards sainthood is both fascinating and inspiring. The game also features a cast of supporting characters, including Claire and Grace, who are both interesting and well-developed. 

Of course, as with any game, there are a few drawbacks to this game. The game's controls can be a bit finicky, which can lead to frustration during intense battles. Finally, the game's story can feel a bit predictable at times, with some plot twists feeling a bit forced.

[h1][b][3] Verdict [/b][/h1]
Overall, Stigmata of Sacrilege is an excellent action RPG that is sure to appeal to fans of the genre. Its engaging story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals make it a must-play for anyone who loves action-packed RPGs. The inclusion of adult content adds an extra layer of excitement and sensuality to the gameplay, making it a great choice for players looking for something a bit different. Highly recommended!

Have to say the only improvement is the graphics, all other changes are just fillers and unnecessary, if not to say, laughable horror scenes. The remake is much easier. I did not expect, that the same riddles would have been implimanted, but the whole ""New Orleans""-part, took me an hour at most. When I played the 2008 version I have spent at least an hour at the safe alone.

Now the thing that realy drives me mad about this game. When we arrive at the hospital, I was quite surprised to see Dr. Gygax had become a woman, I am sure there were a lot of female administration staff in hospitals back in the days. And that all the staff memebers had decided to wear very obvious red amlets.
May I remember that this part of the game takes place in Switzerland? And then,  there is not even a German synchro for this game.

And then there are these stupidly made emotion scenes.  The developers take your picture of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson and throw it straight into the rubbish bin.

Last Frogwares game I have bought, did not buy any of the new games already. But I did not expect them to fail the remake like this as well.

There are also updated physics to mention, and the exclusive tables for the new game look gorgeous! 

The biggest problem that most Pinball FX enthusiasts will face is that they own up to 80% of the tables and have paid only a fraction for each through the various Pinball FX3 sales over the last five years. There is no way to move these tables to the latest platform, which is just another barrier to enjoying Virtual Pinball. Don't get me wrong; it's not like Zen will pull Pinball FX3 from Steam and somehow remove the owner's access to the tables they already own on the previous version. They are just creating a distaste for PFX3 owners and potentially confusing prospective consumers for the new version of Pinball FX. 

It's bittersweet that such a solid offering can drag itself down by not giving the most loyal fans a path to bring tables forward and take advantage of the apparent benefits without repurchasing every table. The alternative option is to spend endless money purchasing monthly or annual access to the tables, which is nothing I am interested in. These access passes may be a good option for others, and I will encourage everyone to play these tables as they see fit. 

In the end, I'm going to hold off for the tables to go on sale and pick the ones that I don't own first and slowly ( and cheaply) pick up the remaining tables that I deem worthy of a second purchase.

Enjoy!

1224,136618219.0,2328760,"Not impressed, ""Pro Physics"" feels like flippers are made of jelly (lack strength and accuracy), not realistic and not arcade-ish like FX3 either.

And only for that change and some other minor visual improvement (that looks completely overdone and creates a lot of visual disturbance), they're charging people again if they want to play the tables they already bought in FX3 / FX2, using some ridiculous bundles to make it seems like ""it's a great deal"" for all those FX3 players.

Optimization is not good either, performance is all over the place, loading times are quite high for a simple pinball game (even worse than FX3). Tables (both old and new) are overpriced, at least in my region. Table achievements are missing.

And they also sell coins that you can use to purchase monthly and yearly subscriptions. Yeah, I'm gonna subscribe to a pinball service, sure. Good luck selling this one, ZEN Studios, I'm not gonna be part of it this time.",0.0

1229,136662678.0,1949030,"[b]Normal Game Stuff[/b]

The environments are really nice, lighting and graphical fidelity overall is awesome with Unreal Engine 5 goodness, and the sounds are really good. You can feel the London gloom and the Louisiana heat. Stuff like footsteps on various types of terrain and the sounds of opening and closing doors are some little details that really increase the realism and immersiveness. High level of polish on everything.

Game wise, initially my main point of comparison was Call of Cthulhu - I now feel that’s a bit unfair at least from a gameplay perspective. CoC is an RPG. The Awakened isn’t. It’s a detective game, so pretty much all the gameplay is puzzle solving, mostly piecing together clues to figure out what happened at a scene. There’s never any time pressure apart from a few isolated events. 

The game is also completely linear. There are dialogue choices you can make, but they don’t affect anything in more than a cursory way. There’s only one ending.

[b]Horror[/b]

I consider myself a coward when it comes to horror, and this game is fine. There are a few semi-jumpscares (and they’re delightful), but not many, and most of the “horror” is the analytical discovery of what happened at a crime scene. I actually wish the game had more horror content to make the threat feel more palpable.

[b]Mythos Treatment[/b]

This is the stuff that really matters to me. CoC had jank, but I liked how it treated the Mythos, so that’s the bar to beat.

To me, there’s 2 crucial elements to this kind of Lovecraftian tale: the slow buildup of dread truth, and the protagonist’s inevitable descent into madness (i.e. their reactions to the truth being revealed).

The Awakened unfortunately falls over a bit here. Where CoC got freaky not too far in and then kept ramping up, the Awakened layers on the Mythos to hook you in at the start, pulls back through the middle, then ramps it up again for the end. I was particularly disappointed at the middle section, where human horror is the focus. I don’t want the Witcher - humans are not the real monsters. If you’re telling a Lovecraftian tale, sure, humans are monsters, but the real monsters are the [i]monsters[/i]. [spoiler]This is the Awakened’s biggest weakness - we never directly, incontrovertibly see a Mythos creature. We don’t see a Deep One, and certainly not Cthulhu. We never get confirmation that the Mythos is real. There’s definitely brain-bendy stuff going on that speaks to Sherlock’s mental deterioration (in particular there’s 2 actual scares in the first half that have stuck with me), but there’s always plausible deniability.[/spoiler]

Sherlock’s reactions to stuff are mostly good - like I said, the voice actor for Sherlock does a really good job of someone supremely confident in their mental faculties struggling when those faculties suggest things that don’t make any sense. This is particularly true in the final confrontation with the big bad. I love the climaxes when [spoiler]there’s the dialogue between the insane, zealous antagonist and the protagonist who desperately wants to deny the truth but can’t. The moment when it all becomes too much, and the protagonist’s hold on traditional reality breaks and they finally give in to the awful truth of the universe -[/spoiler] those are the moments that I love the most about these tales, and despite the lacklustre buildup, the Awakened sticks the landing really well.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

I would wait until this game is on sale to play it. It’s too expensive unless you’re craving this specific thing. It’s consistently middling with a very good climax.

If you’re craving a Mythos hit, play Call of Cthulhu - it’ll be way cheaper for one thing. It has lower lows (older game jank, and prolonged tedious stealth sequences) but also higher highs ([spoiler]getting violently dismembered by a Dimensional Shambler, actually summoning Cthulhu[/spoiler]), and you’ll get to see way more actual Mythos stuff and feel more scared of it. It has skill points and skill checks. It has multiple endings. It has a R’lyehian language. It has a sanity meter. God I love the sanity meter in that game. I know it’s a reductive and inaccurate depiction of mental health but I don’t care, it’s amazing. It starts full and never ever increases, it only ever goes down. Some dialogue options are locked if your sanity is too high. The descriptions of your character’s slowly deteriorating mental state are freaking great. If you want this, play CoC.

Anyway, that’s the end of my review. Hope that was helpful.

1230,136662307.0,1949030,"I feel awful leaving a mostly negative review because I love this series and I know that the devs had a difficult time trying to get this game out while their country was being invaded but I don’t think it’s as good as it could be.

For starters, IMO the best two games in this series are Crimes and Punishments and The Testament. Both get at the heart of Sherlock Holmes mysteries and really demonstrate the game play one would expect. The Devils Daughter was so bad I almost didn’t play Chapter One. And while I thought Chapter One was a little sad, I enjoyed it so I was excited to see what they would do with The Awakened remaster. 

Now this remaster looks great and I like that it references Chapter One but that’s about it. It’s too short (which I get because of the devs having to deal with real life issues) and linear which can make the side cases added to the main story difficult to complete because you can’t go backward. The mini map is difficult to use because there’s no pointer to show where you are on the map. And I know the devs like horror games, but I think this leaned to heavy into that direction while forgetting how to tell a true Sherlock Holmes story.

And the thing I really didn’t appreciate the most was the ending. Sherlock is quirky but he’s not insane. I think the devs are leaning too hard into exploring what makes Sherlock tick but have gone off the deep end. I really hope that if they continue this incarnation of Sherlock, they pull back a bit on that. Or I’m really hoping they go back to what they did for C&P and the Testament.

I think next time I’ll wait to preorder the game.",0.0

1232,136663651.0,1772830,"Rusted moss is an extremely beautiful and rewarding game play experience with a main focus on movement. The main draw to the game is that there is no double jump, only a grappling hook. This means that rather than trying to time a midair jump you have to carefully plan a big swing or drop in order to try to make it to your destination. This control scheme allows for extremely fun and addicting game play while also having an extremely high skill cap. 

Oh and did I mention there are ROCKET JUMPS!!!! Yes that's right just when you thought your bungee grapple hook experience couldn't get any better the devs added a ROCKET JUMP! so now you can blow your enemies sky high and fling yourself through rocket propelled means!

I personally put over 30 hours into just the demo of this amazing game and for around a 10-11 hour experience this game ticks all possible boxes for me! Overall this game is very rewarding if you take the time to learn the mechanics as even after 30 hours im still constantly learning more about the physics of the game and the more I learn the more fun the game becomes.

The general aesthetics were extremely pleasant, and reminded me a bit of Momodora; what story and lore there was looked very compelling; and oh - most importantly, the gameplay was fantastic. Platforming felt great, the grappling hook had a slight learning curve but quickly felt like second nature and opened up so many options and so much depth. Now that the game is out and while I'm not nearly finished with the game yet but I am pleased to report that the game is everything I had hoped it would be - maybe more. 

Everything I said about the demo holds true for the full game so far, and in terms of new observations: The game does an excellent job of providing a well structured critical path, while rewarding expert play with an incredible amount of free-form exploration which often feels sequence breaking (in a good way,). Exploration is extremely rewarding, offering skill-testing platforming challenges, exciting new guns and items, interesting lore, and brutal optional bosses.

1242,136663292.0,1893370,"Even 20 years later I still have a soft spot for anything that reminds me of the original Unreal, I remember before I had my own computer I would play it with friends in the game cafes back when multiplayer games were just getting popular, they only had 5 games installed, Starcraft, Half-life, Quake, Diablo2, and Unreal. It's a shame they are no longer on Steam, granted I think the genre has been going downhill after UT2004, they tried but it could capture the magic -  that awesome music, simple gameplay, and just satisfying carnage. This game attempts to capture the spirit and the soul of those games, but it also adds a twist to it which I did not enjoy. 

Everything outside of the core gameplay is a bit lacking, the only thing this game does really well is just the feel for the weapons and the character movement (except the bots, they are kinda junky). The current story mode only has about 70 minutes of content, so you really not getting a lot for the price. Now, you can play against bots in the custom games, but the AI pathing is very bad, pretty much making it pointless, especially in the domination and the ""capture the flag"" mode. Also, I feel like the maps need to be bigger, the bots respawn almost right on top of me, and there is never a window where I can actually benefit from killing them, it's easier to just ignore them, maybe there needs to be a respawn delay.

Interestingly, this game is not what you might think, I don't want to say much more than that to avoid spoilers, but it's not in a classic format where you progress in the arena, although I kinda wish it was, something like UT2004 would be more appropriate here, I would prefer a team management game. There are some gimmicks in the narrative that don't work, every time I am trying to enjoy the gameplay it has to interrupt me in order to do some narrative gimmicks. If I compare it directly to Unreal Gold, there is only 1 big stage in this game, and even that is only 10-15 minutes,  the tension that I felt running away from Unreal predators is just not there. 

I am seeing a lot of praise for the narrative here, but outside of some funny cheese from 90s there is really not a lot to say, it's very cliche at this point to have any kind of mind games. If anything, I think the Unreal story part was told through a good level design and navigation, and I find that many stages in this game didn't get the same treatment. 

[h1]Pros: [/h1]

(+) With the exception of the AI, I think the character movement and the weapons feel good. I find the game plays a bit too fast compared to  UT so tracking with guns can be a bit unpredictable if you play on high difficulty, but if we can just make the hardest AI less teleporty, I think it would be fine.

(+) The game seems to use the same or at least similar sound effects, for the most part, the actual atmosphere is very nostalgic. I mean the music is not as good, but I mean, how many games have better music than UT, not many. I appreciate a little bit of 90s action voice lines.

(+) I do like the visuals, but I think the dev is missing the point with some of the levels, it depends on the location, I think there is a lot of room for improvement, you could even rely more on platforming to create challenges since you can move so much in this game, don't be afraid to create more verticality for the player to jump around.

[h1] Feedback: [/h1]

[u] Enemies & Level Design [/u] - one very big problem with this game is that many enemies are not actually fun to kill. Like, you have these guns that have nice impact feel to them, but some of the story parts have these stupid projectiles that you can't see or some random birds. I have not seen any decent enemies that are not bots until one of the last stages. Honestly, you should completely remove all of that poorly color-coded junk, all enemies should be chunky and fun to kill, try to combine Unreal with Doom for the story parts.

The arena stages are too small specifically for the team modes. Also, you want to put the respawns a bit further back so the bots don't come back instantly when you kill them.

You need to make longer levels with more optional navigation, the only stage in this game that kinda matches what I expected from this game is the one with the robot boss. It often feels like you are running through an empty level with nothing to do. Also on a side note, try to avoid overusing any dark corners like the stage with the acid, even if the texture is not great it will always look better than just dark wall.

[u] AI [/u] - the pathing on the AI is very bad, and yet if you play on the hardest difficulty it's very hard to track them with a gun, the movement in this game feels maybe 30% faster than UT so it's almost like they are teleporting around (assuming they don't get stuck like they often do).

[u] Narrative [/u] - if that is what you want to do it's fine, my problem is that it feels like the game takes the control away from me all the time. Like, let me play for 30 minutes, then inject some narrative you know, if you play mind games every 5 minutes it's not going to feel like an Unreal game, you still need some immersion with the level exploration, and that means stop interrupting the gameplay.

[b] Overall Thoughts on EA 4/14/23: [/b]

I think the game gets the atmosphere and the gameplay right for the most part, but when you look into the details, like the magic of Unreal level design, it needs a lot of work. The story is a bit too much in your face, you want it to feel more natural, don't force mind games on player, more game, fewer interruptions. Probably not worth what the dev is asking for it, I expected more than 70 minutes, or at least an arena mode that is fun to play (the AI sucks). 

Unreal has some sentimental value for me so... I figure many people would find this a bit underwhelming, but it has a few nice things going for it.

Absolutely no lag.
Graphics look great with ray tracing.
Too early regarding the physics ( I shall update in time) it is different not sure for better or for worse yet.

I have read reviews on here from people having so many issues but I have not.
The difference between the graphical finesse of this version compared to Pinball FX 3 is blatantly apparent.
Some are saying they cannot see any difference but honestly they need to go to Spec savers.

Some are saying it is slugging even with the card I am using but this is not so.
There may be something wrong with their systems /drivers/ whatever.

I have bought three tables the Williams new ones.
I have played a few of the others but the polish shines through on the original tables far more than any others.

This version is not an essential purchase but more of an option to play the newer tables ( least for myself).

The pricing here in Australia seems reasonable and I suspect some of the bitterness in reviews is people using a potato and so they are stamping their feet ranting because they 'wish' they could play it.

Anyway like I said, politics aside this is worth it for the new tables of Williams etc.
I own all of the tables on the older version but doubt I shall be buying the Star Wars and other such Marvel etc.

I shall likely stick with buying only original 'new' tables.
Graphics all highest settings ray tracing on 9/10 on the Williams tables.
Sound: Seems crispier and more base better spacial reproduction.
Game play: Different from the last version the jury is still out but seems good.

Value for money for the tables: Well pinball is my thing and I shall eventually probably re-buy the original Williams because they look so damn good, yet not with immediacy.

All of the other tables I likely shall not buy at this point.

Verdict if you're on the fence.
It is NOT an essential purchase unless like me you're a pinball simulation addict and want all the bells and whistles.

There is NO fundamental reason to buy it if you're on the fence FOR EVERYONE ELSE.
Overall score and verdict:
9/10 A must buy for the new Williams tables.

You can view my initial impressions review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/BcbFdvH3lx8

If you enjoyed playing Kill It With Fire (Non-VR) then you're going to enjoy this VR port. It is a bit on the janky side though. However, it's just fun to be an agent of chaos in VR.

You get to kill Spiders in a plethora of manners. You have silencers, shotguns, revolvers, flamethrowers, molotovs, explosives, bazookas, a frying pan, etc. You can set the whole world on fire with your single-minded quest to kill any possible spider that may be out there.

If you enjoy explosives, this game is for you. If you're an aspiring arsonist, this game for you. If you just hate spiders, this game is for you. You can follow the objectives for each map or just do your own thing. The only thing that matters in the end is to kill all the spiders by any means necessary.

Game is running on the Unreal Engine. On my RTX 3080, on high graphical settings, I did experience some severe frame rate drops / stutters ... usually when lots of stuff exploded. I should have probably lowered the graphics to medium though. You have full locomotion or teleportation available, along with smooth or snap turning. You can play comfortable seated, as there is a button crouch, height adjustment, along with magnet hands. There is some jank though grabbing items or using your inventory, etc.

I think the game is fun, if you like retro shooters you probably will like this one too, I played almost 3 hours and not sure how much longer left in game but overall I think it's a good game. 

Visual are cool, specially the lighting of the game felt really nice. Game play is fun and can be challenging at some areas. There are variety of enemies to kill and as developer said it's basically killing horde of enemies. There is no story you just progress through different levels which each one has a very unique design too.

The only think that I didn't like was music and to me it felt out of place and disconnected from the game, had to reduce the music volume. But it might be just a personal preference.

I’m honestly content with how much Capcom put into this spin-off series.

Aside from my good thoughts on the BN series , the craziest thing I could say about these games especially the show (NT Warrior & Axess) pretty much predicted today’s current tech (PETs = smart phone devices, able to jack in to devices such as ovens, TVs, doghouse I know lol, etc. = Internet of Things).

I must admit that I have lost in this game... a lot! So, is it hard? It certainly can be. But unbalanced? Personally, I don't think so. The unique mechanics and strategies can be challenging at first, but I think it's a good kind of challenge. Every time I lose, I can see what I could have done differently to give myself a better chance, or decisions I could have made to be more survivable.

The game has a unique gameplay setup where you have two rows with three places on each row. You can ""crown"" units so that they are available to be played on the first turn. You can also reorder units and recall units to heal them, then replay them later. There are also a variety of cards that synergise with the units. There is so much depth to this game, and it gives you a lot of strategic options to explore.

This is what this game does, it invokes adventure.   I really am liking the survival system, and managing your partys gold. food . The more you explore, the more the map uncovers for you.

1. Bad net-code. 
A friend of mine had to restart his computer after 5 minutes from the start of the co-op session because wartales somehow completely froze the system. His computer specs higher than recomended system settings and he had never face with such problems before.
Second situation happened in the 10th minute of the game, we came into salty mine talked with npc but later understood that we can't leave this location. Any our actions had no response.

2. Lack of information at the start of the game
My friends and I bought this game just to play together. In a co-op session, you have a tutorial about the game mechanics, but there is no introduction to introduce the player to the world, and no explanation of the main objective.
Maybe this will be explained later, but it would be nice to get a brief overview of what the game wants from the player at the start of the game.

[b] Distilled gameplay elements with a survival and resource management synergy leads to a fun and replayable experience! [/b]
https://youtu.be/l-vbXDYvoh8

TLDR in case you don't want to watch the video:

1. Its less complicated and in-depth compared to bigger scale turn based tactics games (like X-Com), but the synergy and decision making during missions makes it equally intense 

2. Aside from the obvious turn based tactics comparisons, the resource management and survival elements like food, rest, stress levels, and shelters give the game another dimension that add onto its already tense combat. It's simple enough to understand, but tough enough to make it so much more than just a walk in the park

3. Its not award winning writing and dialogue, but the environments and side missions / events certainly add onto the world building and lore in Shardpunk's grimdark steampunk world.

4. Despite its rather short campaign (about 5 -6 hours on normal difficulty), the wide variety of characters, skills, tactics, quirks, campaign map, and overall types of playstyles, give it so much more replayability!

Its not the next groundbreaking title in the genre, but it certainly is a well executed amalgamation of some of the best turn based gameplay elements, and more!

I would recommend fans of turn based tactical games to give Shardpunk a try!

Finger Soccer is a Unity Asset flip, what Valve calls a ""fake game"".  The ""developer"", 小小游戏, took the [url=https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/finger-soccer-game-kit-45611]Finger Soccer Game Kit[/url] Unity Store tutorial/demo/game asset pack from the real developers, Finalboss, changed the name, and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get $4 USD of your money for someone else's work.

The products that result from asset flips aren't ""real"" games.  They lack depth and content, because they're just simplistic copies of demos or tutorials.  In this case, ""Finger Soccer Game Kit"" is just a game pack/template to teach people how to make a soccer/physics game for mobile phones, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so a copy+paste of it can't be recommended.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  Sure, sometimes they may change a few cosmetic things, swap out different assets etc, but at heart it's functionally identical to the asset they're ripping off.  In this case it's a direct 1:1 copy of the asset with no noticable changes. 

Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

1333,136734112.0,1949030,"As a nostalgic player of the original title I was super thrilled about this remake. 
I won't hide it: I love this younger Sherlock. I loved him in Chapter One and having him going through this adventure. He is freshing up the series and it was very entertaining having a younger and less experienced sherlock solving the case. 
Connecting his emotional status with the events of Chapter One was so on point. I was a little skeptical at first 'cause this is basically the very first adventure with watson (where in the old games they know each other from a very long time) but their  reletionships was developed very well. 
Knowing the rpg of call of cthulhu it's like sherlock is failing all his sanity rolls while getting all the intelligents rolls. 
Althought I didn't quite like some of the changes from the old title, others where perfect and heartbreaking.
They used the same gameplay as chapter one, which I liked, but a couple of old style puzzles would have be a nice reminder of the old title. 
While the supernatural thing in devil's daugher was meh, Lovecraft horror works incredibly well with sherlock. 
It is a good title (maybe a little too rushed in the writing) both for old and new players.",1.0

1335,136733208.0,1772830,"The game's incredibly fun, mainly having a rocky start as you get used to the game's titular mechanic the ""hook"" as the game basically forces a crash test on the player to know the ins and outs of its physics and how to manipulate it to the best of your ability. Once you understand how everything works it feels satisfying to land tricky jumps as you squeeze the physics and the movement tech for all that its worth.

If there's any issue I have it's that though the grappling is amazing when doing things like gaining height and doing tricky jumps, certain parts of the game require more... ""control"" and precision that the bungie cord mechanics simply don't provide. Otherwise it's a nitpick on an amazing game.",1.0
1336,136734973.0,1811990,"The game is quite hard but I feel like many reviews focus a bit too much on ""winning"" rather than just enjoying the game for runs. I feel like beating the game is only icing, the real fun is playing through the game and using what you're given and I want to say no, you're not always given the opportunity to win even with the best of skill sometimes but I do want to say most times, winning is definitely within arm's reach. That said, I still do have my gripes about the game:

1.) The starting leaders doesn't seem to make any rhyme or reason to how they are balanced. For example, I can be given a 12hp 5attack 4turn leader and while also simultaneously be given a choice of a 8hp 4nut(shield) 3attack 5turn leader. The second leader is very similar to the first except that it has 2 less attack and has one more turn of count down. Like why? The only explanation I see is that they're from different tribes but the tribal differences isn't THAT big to ever pick the latter leader in this scenario. I can never see a reason why any leader should be 3 attack and have a 5 turn count down - not even if they have frenzy, in fact, 5 count down leaders just shouldn't exist, period. There have been many multiple other instances of just crappy leaders and there's no way to ""reroll"" them without starting a run and quitting (which makes me feel dirty).

2.) There are some enemies that are incredibly hard to deal with and more notably, two types of enemies that consistently ends my runs. The enemies I'm talking about is the acorns that gives 3 thorns to all allies and the other acorn that makes all YOUR units aimless. These guys always spawn together and it is completely brutal to have to deal with because the aimless causes you to attack randomly within the row while the thorns is well, going to likely kill your units, especially given how the average hp of units is 5hp, getting just a couple unlucky hits in means everything of yours is dead. Now this wouldn't seem nearly impossible to deal with except that the health of the acorns are like 14hp so not only can you not control which enemies you're hitting in that row but even when you do get lucky, you have to get lucky multiple times. That is just in no way acceptable that these enemies exist with that much health.

All said though, the game is fun, I just don't think playing it with the mindset that you're going to win every run is realistic and quite honestly, that's the way rogue-like games should be. Sometimes you're just given crappy choices and you just have to make the most out of it.",1.0

1338,136734392.0,1811990,"Ignore the negative review. The game is good, but with 1.5k+ review on 3 days after launch, there are bound to be questionable people around more than usual.

The art is amazing. The music is exceptionally nice and reactive. The gameplay is highly innovative.

The game is roguelike first and everything second which means you will lose and lose a lot. This does not ponder or feed the questionable mind of ""modern"" gamers who cannot stand losing and just scream ""uwah ah oh no I'm 3 hours into the game and I still cannot win the first fight consistently. this is clearly a balance issue."" or ""uwah ah oh no I'm 10 hours win and cannot even get my first win, this is clearly a balance issue."".
Yes. The game is highly unbalanced, and it is one of the main issue right now but that doesn't justify the amount of negative review the game is getting. The first fight is definitely winnable by any means and there might be some case with cursed bells that will just make you lose but it's just roguelike in general - you are not meant to win every run.

The glaring issue; however, is the bs randomness the game can bring to your run which can be unbearable at times (yes I'm talking about you dangling cursed bells), but if you are playing casually the first few fights are definitely doable and can be won quite consistently (I'm looking at you shademancers).

Another problem is it's a card game that requires skill to play, so it might not pander certain group of people too.

So all in all it's just crying gamers wanting to win everything without caring if they're having fun or not spam their frustration on unjustified ""wah wah unbalanced make me lose 100% fight I cant even do first fight this is clearly balancing issue"" negative reviews.

If you don't care losing and just like roguelike in general, the game is for you, but if you are not just stay away. It's just that simple smh.

PS. to dev if they are reading this (though I doubt they will since the amount of comment is aggravating) please recognize how random-ish your game can be and change some achievement required to unlock some amulets. Just make them separate achievement with no unlockables instead. Winning 3 times in a row in a highly volatile and random game - really???",1.0

I see many ppl complaning about balance, some even claming you have to follow some kind of ""meta"" to get past the 2 first encounters but thats just not true, the game gives you a stupid amount of free controll during your turn(you can move around your units as mutch as you like, optimizing damage taken you can even for free recall units and they heal up). Like other games the endgame becomes ""scale up FAST"" usually but thats not a bad thing, the amount of ways to synergize your cards in this and the interaction between cards are staggering, for example did you know you could use flamewater on cards in your hands instead, for example on slapcrackers(4x random attacks that deal 1dmg) to doubble its damage output instead of putting it on an 6 counter unit. I hate to be this guy but if your complaning that the game is ""unbalanced"" or something simular then just git gud and start reading what the enemy cards do.

1341,136734033.0,1811990,"I feel like I need to leave a rare review to counteract some of the negative reviews here...

I dont know where many of these reviews are coming from maybe the beautiful artstyle of the game has attracted many people that never played a rougelite deckbuilder before but the difficulty in this game is not a problem at all. Is the game difficult? yes to some extend since you are required to build working synergies and actively think about your turns. This gets more complicated since the game gives you a lot more options in combat due to how the positioning and effect systems work. This is not a bad thing though and it is precisely because of the options you have paired with the relatively narrow scope of each tribes deck that you have a lot of control about what happens in combat.

Every effect and ability is cleary written on the cards and works pretty much as you would expect. There are some peculiarities that you need to work out when first encountering stuff (for example how the turn order works for cards or that units that consume allied cards will never eat the enemy leader) but after that it is always the same and reliable. I think if you read a card it is very obvious what purpose the card serves and which other cards would have good synergy with it.. Attack buffs are more valuable on multi hit targets / snow can be used to disable certain mechanics etc.

It is still a roguelite though so you will have some runs where you just dont get a working synergy ready in time for the difficulty ramp up. Due to the options the game gives you and the mentioned before relatively narrow scope of each deck these cases are rare though and can often traced back to bad decisions the player makes.

Each Enemy clan/type and boss requires some specific handeling  that you will need to keep in mind throughout the game. Many other rougelites work with optimizing builds for a hyper specific approach which employs the same strategy for every fight and then proceeds to steamroll the game. Such a thing doesnt really work here since you need to keep your approaches rather varied. If you rely completely on one slow heavy hitter you will be fucked by shielded enemies. If you build completely for rapid multi hitters you will be fucked by counter enemies (if you dont circumvent them which the game allows you to do). In short until you have a few runs under your belt and know what to expect you will create builds that have failure points. Again this is normal for this genre and part of the learning process.


The game so far has been awesome and I have had a lot of fun figuring out the best move in any given turn and many seemingly unwinnable battles were clawed back to victory not because I randomly got the RNG god card but because I managed to outplay the enemy setup turn for turn which in my opinion is much more statisfying than randomly pulling  the I win card.

1344,136733487.0,1811990,"First thing first, since I've played the game from the first demo back around 2022 October, I've been in love with the game. Basically innovating in the Roguelike Deckbuilder genre since Slay the Spire started it.

The visual and sound of the game are incredible. The art for each cards and the designs of characters within the game are so cute and will appeal to everyone. The music when the game is still in its relaxed state, then intensifies in combat and boss battle are amazing. Not to mention how solid the system of the game is, every click on the card or the bell is satisfactory, interacting with map events are great (like crushing the ice to get a companion), equipping charms is always fun, and many fun interactions too. Many can be improve with QoL still, but still solid at launch.

For these alone, this game is already great. But.

Now for the elephant in the room, which the majority have already written. I also agree that the balance of the game is out of whack. It took me 8 hours of gameplay and multiple tries to finally win the game for the first time. I've since started 10+ more runs and yet to reach the final boss again (which is[spoiler] my previous run winner, and I consider that is pretty cool)[/spoiler]. And I just play this genre of game casually.

Now I still do recommend this game for its innovation on the genre and solid system overall, but definitely not for the casuals deckbuilder players. Because compared to other game in its genre, Wildfrost is like Darkest Dungeon in it's early access days. Unbalanced, Stiff (in a way, you can't play your way, you have to play how the game wants you to win), and you are slave to the RNG. You can build your deck to stack one or two effects to make it strong on the first 2 battles, but then you're gonna hit a wall where your deck is useless and you have to restart again and again and again and again.

Now the unbalance does not only applies to the gameplay, but also on how it affects the players. Sure every roguelike/lite games is about making mistakes in your early runs and learn from it so you can make improvements on your next runs. But if the majority of the run you make is a failure to learn from, then the game became a chore, because you have to learn instead of just play.

That's why in Slay the Spire have the option to make the game harder for you with the ascension system, while the basic gameplay is as easy as it comes. It is more accessible and balanced for the players that just wants to play casually and those that wants to tryhard.

That's why in Hades, you can make the game harder with modifier to torture yourself with, while the basic game is a simple hack 'n slash roguelike.

--

I still like this game, and willing to be crushed over and over again since I love playing roguelike/lite games (although StS is only the RL-deckbuilder I've played). But I can't deny the game is unbalanced as I've written, and I hope it can be balanced just like other game in the roguelike/lite genre. More accessible for the casuals and still challenging for the tryhards.",1.0

With the game being released I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised with how the game turned out.

Wartales is a game with a lot of similarities to Expeditions: Conquistador and even a little of the Banner Saga.
At the start of the game you decide what type of initial squad and backstory you want to go with like being a bunch of wanderlust farmers wanting to seek their fortunes to former soldiers running from the war to bandits who have escaped prison. The decisions at the start helps to ground you to the world and inspire you to role play as the type of squad you chose. You get to fully customise four characters like choosing the sex, appearance and character traits, one for free but if you want two positive traits you must pick a negative trait to counter balance it. 
For example with my squad I made a big viking dude with a shield and club who was strong of arm and very stout but his negative was that he ate more food than the others because he was so big and strong.

The comparisons to Expeditions: Conquistador begin when you start moving around the map to explore and find new locations that have different quests and events tied to them as well as fight tactical battles battles on a square based grid (Expedition: Conquistador used a hex grid though) and begin to level up your companions and have some minor role play events with them as time goes on. Each area of the game has its own story/quest line and there are different endings for them. The first area of the game is a hot bed of refugees running from away from a war in another kingdom.

The comparison to Banner Saga is that initial battles are very much you take a turn then the enemy takes a turn but unlike Banner Saga you are not punished for killing enemies and as such you get more turns to use. The battle system also allows you to chose which character to use on your turn so for example you wanted to start combat with your big shield dude you could run them in first turn or you could use your archer and shoot at the back line on the first turn. This is different from most tactical games because in those games you have to take turns in a certain order but in this game you can chose the character you really want to move instead of having to wait till the end of the turn to use that really slow character.

The game is very fun to play and enthralling; it is the little moments that help make this game like when my archer Erin kept accidentally shooting the de-facto captain of my bandit group in the back and while camping he tried to have her kicked out but the other bandits said it was a mistake obviously and to forgive her just for her to shoot him in the back again in the very next encounter and for the de-factor captain to get a paranoid trait after it happened.",1.0

1383,136643560.0,1527950,"I came to this one after bouncing off Band of Brothers, and this game definitely has some of the same similarities - managing a mercenary company that needs to be constantly fed and paid and dealing with the pressure to push forward against the risk of permanent loss.  It's an ironman-lovers formula, where stories told are largely generated by your decisions and the rolls of the dice. 

Wartales is much more personal, however, with your initial starting band sharing a small history you decide, and each character having particular jobs and roles in your found family of bandits, heroes, or mercenaries.  The death tolls aren't quite as high (although it's possible I'm just bad at Band of Brothers), and the personal growth of each character feels nicely paced and carefully managed.  There are all these little, simple systems that categorize how you are progressing, from your knowledge of the world leading to general party perks to each characters individual relationship.  

The best example of what Wartales is, I think, comes from a simple thing I found in the first few hours. in firing a shot from an arrow into a crowded fight, I hit an unlucky 20% and accidentally shot a companion.  This wasn't a fight ender, but it had two specific mechanical consequences: 
one, the two party members relationship deteriorated, 
and two, the wounded member developed a new perk called Eyes in the Back Of Your Head, to prevent such occurences from happening in the feature.  
That's the core of it - tight mechanical tactical combat coupled with consequences that are narrative on a personal level. 

I could speak a lot to the games seemingly open nature and the really elegant nature of its combat and experience systems, but its whats in between them that most fascinates me.  This game uses its quiet preparation time really well - despite fairly light procedural dialog, the small systems interlock in a way to create a sense of family and camraderie in your little band that feels meaningful.  Because of the non combat class system the characters you're risking aren't fully featureless fighters - they're also the ones that cook your meals, or smith your weapons, or do your laundering.  They're people that  you care about.  That's a hard trick to pull in a game of this style, and its definitely worth price of purchase even if you're only in for a few runs.

The music score is amazing, the art is amazing, and the vibe and style just feel so damn good. It's almost like a Little Nightmare vibe with some Inside but all morphed into a dope FPS shooter + with it's own jam. On that note the controls are tight and the shooting is spot on. There is a jumping mechanic and puzzles and secrets so that will keep you busy and not just focus on grinding the trigger. Also gibbing enemies is like a pimp pancake breakfast you keep wanting more. It all just feels really good.

Another note the blood effects and lighting all are super nice and it adds a lot to the game. It's a UE4 game and I have perfect performance with no stutters what so ever or shader issues so that is pretty cool.

Note - if you play with a gamepad(XB360, XB1 or XBSX) and want to invert the thumb just get Xbox Accessories from the MS store and just make and activate a profile to fix the game.

Works out of the box well with the upcoming Universal Unreal VR injector from praydog. With the recent addition of a toggle for head locked aiming this is pretty fun to play like that. Would be a good candidate to add further motion controls to as well. 

Game is pretty difficult even on Easy and relies on you to use the manual quick save/ quick load system. Think the default game-pad mapping is okay but is better when the jump button is on a trigger or shoulder button. Would help if the quick save and quick load buttons were also on the controller as well.

Has ten levels, each with hidden secrets, can be replayed with harder difficulties and modifiers. Has a gun that shoots leeches :)

3) the physics seems way off (regular and pro), regular is floaty like a gummybear on a trampoline, and pro's nudging is too sensetive two nudges relatively fast after each other and instant tilt & no warning, especially hurtfull if you use a controller (irl i can drag save a machine a inch or two (5cm) in tournement settings and still not get tilt or a tilt warning).

4) issues that carried over from the epic version , Keybinds constantly reseting after a restart of the game, Event tournements like ""flip challenge"" and ""time challenge"" ending early.

5) Some of the models on tables look worse than on a VPX recreation it

1411,136675071.0,1911360,"This game reminds me of Dead Cells, but with smoother movement like in Metroid Dread. The combat is really fluid and responsive, and you need to be careful with your attacks, dash through incoming attacks, and combo your enemies to death. Some tougher ones can even be stunned with an extra stun bar.

It gets more risky in some rooms where you get swarmed by several at once, and need to properly strategize some crowd control.
Once you beat the first boss and meet the second character, Kera, the game and challenges really open up. Kera has lots of melee combos available. And the third one’s gameplay feels more bullet-hell, with long range aiming.
You still have to get in close, as all the better/special weapons use an energy bar, which only gets filled when you use your main weapon.

Run lengths are not too long, from 7-15 minutes per stage, but it’s well worth exploring the whole map, to increase the power level and get better weapons.
The mods are pretty basic right now, but maybe they'll add more special ones or some clearer synergies.

Overall, game is most definitely worth recommending. It has extremely great potential, no doubt.

1412,136675343.0,1911360,"Early Access Review

Interesting setting, very good art direction/asset quality/animations for an indie.  Currently it's a bit basic in its initial early access state, but it's clear that the game has potential to turn into a very solid metroidvania/roguelite.

There are 3 ""worlds"" with the main character having a different version of herself for each one (though functionally this doesn't amount to much yet).  As you beat the boss of each world you unlock a new traversal ability for that specific character.  You gain 2 different meta-resources (orange and blue) to help you strengthen your upgrades, though currently they are pretty lackluster, just minor stat increases.  Orange unlocks new upgrades to be purchased or increases your upgrade slots, blue is what you use to purchase the upgrades.  The second tier of upgrades includes a revive, very useful, work towards that ASAP.

The ""fusion"" mechanic isn't really fleshed out at the moment.  In later updates it looks like the 3 different worlds will be fused together in a way that promotes more thoughtful planning and preparation from the player.  Currently, you can find a terminal in a run to ""fuse"" with one of the other 2 versions of yourself from the other worlds, increasing your health, granting you one of their spells/abilities, traversal ability and giving you a new unique look for the remainder of the run.  It's a nice touch, I just wish it was more accessible and more than just a flat combination of the 2 characters.  So far nothing is in the game that requires you to have 2 different traversal abilities, but it's clear to see how it will be utilized in the future (hopefully).

All in all it's a fun enough game while it lasts.  The current state of the game is somewhat short, I got to the end of the current content in around 4-6 hours (a good understanding of how to dodge enemies will almost trivialize the game and shorten your playtime) but I enjoyed what I played.  

Looking forward to the games progress.",1.0

Bosses are pretty challenging not because they are particularly inspired in design, but due to the small boss arenas, big hurt box on your character, and reliance on clunky grapple controls. After 4 hours I still haven't really got the hang of using grappling in combat.

1416,136618772.0,1811990,"As someone who's constantly looking for new deckbuilders to try out, I was really excited to check out Wildfrost's demo earlier this year. The game combined an adorable artstyle with a high difficulty where it's uncertain whether or not you'll make it one third of the way into the run. The full game did not disappoint me at all -- compared to the demo, the runs have been expanded to include 2 more acts, and there many unlockables for future playthroughs.


The game features wonderful artwork with a cartoony cel-shaded artstyle. All of the character cards have a personality to them, and I was surprised to see that some of the cards would change their appearance depending on actions you take in combat. Blood would splatter on their fronts, a monster would grow depending on how enraged it got and an ally would increase the size of the snowball in their hands after you power her up.

Added to that are various interactive UI elements that react to your actions -- bell relics swing and produce noise when you hover your mouse over them, upgrades are presented as trinkets on a keychain that you can attacks to your units. The various locations you visit also have satisfying animations for interacting with them, be it breaking a slab of ice or feeding your cards to Muncher. This makes the game really fun from an aesthetic point of view, it's simply a joy to look around the interface.


The combat itself seems to be an involved version of an autobatter: you play down unit cards, and they automatically attack targets (or use abilities) after their cooldown is complete. In addition to that, you can play skill cards to influence the battlefield yourself, applying status effects and doing direct damage to units. In between turns, you're free to move any and all of your units around the field, choosing who is going to be at the front to take damage, who can be sacrificed to the incoming heavy hit, and who should be sent back to your deck to recover some hitpoints. Other than these actions, each card you play takes exactly 1 turn to resolve, causing enemies to act immediately, even before your own units.

This causes the game to be all about reacting to the puzzle presented in front of you on each of the turns. How do you take the least amount of damage? How can you kill the most enemies in a single turn, as doing so makes them drop more loot? Can you afford to leave this character out, or should you play it safe and heal it up, resetting its attack timer and having to play it out again later?


The downside of this, is that the battlefield can get rather complex, with multiple enemies and allies triggering each other's abilities, some of which might be unclear to a new player or someone who's not in the mind to pay complete attention to the game. I have lost several runs simply because I forgot about a keyword an enemy had, causing them to hit my hero instead of the default target and losing me the game. The combat is unforgiving -- you're not given warnings or previews about the following turn, though you do get a battlelog where you can see what went wrong. One mishap that kills your hero, and you need to start over (or close the game to reset the combat if you don't mind cheating).


Once you're dead, the game will show you the progress you've made towards unlocking new content. You can get different units to add to your starter deck, which are pets in this game; you can unlock new charms to find in your runs, which represent the game's upgrades; you can also unlock new locations to visit during a run and new factions to play, which feature their own decks and playstyles. 

I'm personally not a fan of meta-progression in games, though I think the way Wildfrost does it is fairly fun. At the same time I do feel that putting some of the encounters behind an unlock barrier feels a little unsatisfying to me. Additionally, the way the game's ""hub"" is organized is that you have ~8 different buildings. After you click on one of them, the NPC inside will show you what type of unlock you can get, and what you need to do to get it. This means that if you want to see all of the challenges you need to complete, you have to keep clicking back and forth between these locations -- and they're spread out all around the screen in a scrollable scene in buildings that aren't easy (for me) to identify the purpose of at a glance.

I would love it if there was a list detailing all the quests in a single menu screen, like the one they have for achievements, and if there was a side panel using which you could switch between all of the buildings without having to scroll or look for the right one.

The game's ""ascension"" mode where you increase the difficulty of the game after completing it is also quite interesting -- you both get penalties and boosts for doing so. The first two difficulty increases make it so enemies have a chance to be upgraded (while dropping more gold) and the waves come out one turn quicker (but your starting unit is played down for free on the first turn).


Having enjoyed this game so much, it was a surprise to me just how many people found it unfun. I read the reviews stating that this is one of the worst deckbuilders around, that it has no sense of balance, that no matter how you build or upgrade your deck, you're bound to lose due to how much stronger the enemies are, that there is absolutely no variety in viable builds. Now, usually I wouldn't fanboy over a game I like just because it received harsh criticism, however, in this case it feels to me that the reviews like that are misleading.


My opinion is that the game's balance is fine. I was capable of winning my run immediately after finishing the tutorial, but I lost because of a mistake. I won my first run on my 4th attempt, and my second one on an increased difficulty on my 10th attempt. The majority of my losses were down to me not fining a solid end-game strategy by the middle of act 2, or because I didn't pay enough attention and got my hero killed. Both of these are fine in this line of games -- you're not [b]meant[/b] to win every run. Some runs are you barely scraping by with a semblance of a deck you cobbled together, while others have you farm a ton of gold with an absurd build you were given. 

The deck variety felt good. It seems to me that you can win using a variety of strategies, [b]however[/b] the game will not let you win if you put all of your eggs in one basket. You're not going to win with a ""poison deck"" because that's likely to be weak against many smaller units, or with a ""thorns deck"" because that's weak against high-hitting enemies, or with a ""heal deck"" because you can't heal if you're dead to a 40 damage attack.


The game will present challenges to you, and you need to be able to answer them appropriately -- you need to tank damage, to kill many small enemies quickly, to kill single large enemies, to put all your pieces on the board, etc. The way to do that is to know what challenges you'll be presented with, and what answers you can use against those challenges, both of which require knowing the game. Of course, sometimes you don't find the best answer, so you might have to settle for some mid option instead, but that's kind of the appeal of roguelikes to me. This mindset helped me get through all of my winning (or close-to-winning) runs, and it is what I feel many people who are dissatisfied with the game's balance are missing.",1.0
1417,136677173.0,1811990,"Want to open by saying Gaziter's art is great. I wishlisted the game because of the art so the game being really good too just makes it even better.

The game itself is an Excellent rougelike deck builder, very unique compared to the other big ones on the market. Much harder than many I've played too, which is great. 

Many of the complaints from other reviews come from not realizing that the game play is a lot more like a puzzle with a lot of moving pieces you have to solve from turn to turn, rather than more straight forward damage calculations (although those are there too). The game demands a lot more precision each turn than most other deck builders, (even Spire until you hit higher ascension levels).

You can definitely brute force some very strong combos, but the game puts a big premium on planning ahead for specific threats, and you wont get good at that until youve lost a good few runs.

Another thing I've noticed after several dozen runs is that while leaders feel weak, I've actually been getting more robust and useful ones now that I've unlocked a good bit of the meta progression. I don't know of they're set to scale up based on your unlocks or if I'm just getting more comfortable with the game so I see the value in things I dismissed before. (I suspect its a bit of both.

Lastly, some things definitely are over or under tuned. Bigfoots are pretty insane and demand an immediate answer. A few player cards could probably stand to have their numbers bumped. One thing I'd really like to see is more cards that don't use up your turn. Not too many, one to three at most. The flow of the turns is really strong as it is, but I think being able to play more than one card per turn almost doubles the decision space that turn, which is really interesting if its not every turn.",1.0

1430,136674779.0,1364020,"TL:DR; The game has the strongest foundation of its kind, the team is super professional and the game overall is a piece of art. The developers deserve way more positive credit than they're given now.


[b]Why this game is different[/b]
I've played hundreds of alpha/beta/ea/released indie shooters over the years. There is a pattern that I've noticed with most of the games that failed: The second there was creative deviation away from the status quo, these studios would immediately make bad decisions. Round-based TDM, revives in respawn gamemodes, operator lock-in in casual gamemodes, removal of jump in a fast paced shooter, gimmicks, semi fire assault rifles by default, asthma inspired stamina systems, overpowered damage-based abilities, etc.

These ideas seem to go through a studio, without any protest. No one at these studios thinks ""hey, maybe we should add a scrollbar to our in-game chat"". It erodes trust in the developers and makes me not want to invest into their game in the long term.


[b]What the game does right[/b]
Boundary innovated a ton in this game, and they didn't make any simular mistakes. The game is pretty, the UI is incredible, progression is addictive, gamemodes are fun, the animations are smooth, audio is immersive, balance is sensible, their handling of playtests was professional, settings carried over from previous playtests, suggestions are being listened to and their communication is fantastic.

The grapple and movement module are a blast, recoil of snipers boosts your speed and emps make you spin. You can pop balloons that blow you away, there are small crates floating in spawn that you can push around and use as cover and you can pressurize rooms which blow enemies away when they open its doors. Even their weirdest gimmicks work out.


[b]When it does go wrong, the team still rocks[/b]
Every developer creates bugs. There are some crashes, bugs, the lobby system has some quirks, and there is performance spikes on some maps. You could even include minor gripes like mostly static spawns. There are some grammatical errors, but if anything they're cute and the community has adopted them. (panta kill enjoyer)

The way the team handled problems is professional and reasonable (even their replies on the steam reviews here). After the rocky launch, the team kept players up to date through their discord. After some fixes, the team gave out 2 ""compensation cosmetics"" as a reward for peoples patience. When VC was broken, they quickly disabled it until it was fixed. The team has stocked up post-launch (played during the beta) content so the game isn't dead right out of the gate.


I would absolutely say that this game is worth buying. Its fun, addictive and high quality. I also feel like the good progression system and the post-launch content can keep the game relevant for long enough. The developers deserve much more respect for all the things they did right (which is most of it)",1.0
1431,136675514.0,1364020,pretty good,1.0
1432,136675546.0,1364020,"THE GOOD:
The zero G and gunplay feels fantastic, plus the audio editing, though a little choppy, REALLY works well for the intensity and immersion. the gunplay is very similar to Titanfall 2's PVP, especially in terms of movement and the TTK, which feels juuuust right to me. Especially when the matches get intense, and you're rushing and making those split second decisions, the game's truly firing on all cylinders, and one i don't feel like stopping. 

The movement is something I've never experienced before, and it just clicks with you after like 10 minutes. Actively taking engagements, feels great! But there's always the possibility to play defensive with snipers and AR's, moving in a disciplined format, cover to cover through hallways. Although camping here will simply not work, since if you're near an enemy, you'll hear a pinging sound to guide you to them, and vice versa. Long range engagements a la battlefield, is still a possibility. 

Balance wise I can't comment, but I've not experienced any unfair fights or guns so far. Everything's got a place, although i DO wish snipers and DMR's got a buff, cause DMRs are they are, are a little too weak, and downright detrimental closer than 20 metres. 

Playing as Spike (stealth CQC lady who leaves a smoke bomb like a squid to evade), just grapple-hooking, stealthing and bum-rushing with a shotgun has no business feeling as addictive as it is. 

And the visuals? Incredible.

I'm playing this from India, on southeast Asian servers, so I've encountered none of the ping issues mentioned in other reviews, and while firefights are often too overstimulating at times, they haven't felt unfair to me in the 15ish games i've played. Plus, it helps that getting a match here, at the time barely takes 5 seconds (all modes are 5v5, and variations of TDM, TDM without respawns, Capture-The-Flag, Site Control, and Bomb-planting)

THE BAD: 
A lot of the translations in the game clearly come from Google translate, like ""Magazine"" is called Ammo Storage Device, and there's little misspellings everywhere. And the updates on steam come in english, but in game they're still in chinese. 
Plus, there's no tutorials on character abilities yet, so you'll need to just trial-and-error your way to grasping them, but that's not too difficult. 

The content is obviously very narrow. Granted the game modes are immensely fun, and the map design has a LOT to give, a lot of the maps are just ""Some space complex above the earth's atmosphere"" and so while they differ in structure, there's little visual changes. 

There's quite some visual bugs, with slow-loading textures, and texture pop in every now and then. With how much detail there is to sift through anyways, this can often get annoying and make you miss enemies which can and will result in deaths that you didn't deserve. I get that it's early access, so this is probably among the more stable games, but still. 

Someone mentioned something about the anticheat reading programs accessing your RAM or something? And how they can ban you from the game if they find sus activities, but someone who understands computers better than me can speak to its quality.

TLDR: I'm deeply deeply hoping this game's able to grow and get better for players in different continents as well, cause the localization as is, is bad, but functional. Once it gets a healthy dose of more content, and longer matches, it'll go HARD. It's worth the price as it is, and there's insane potential here. I can see this becoming one of those niche favorites like Insurgency and the like one day, fingers crossed it does. 8.5/10",1.0

This is a visual novel / dating sim where you are a writer trying to make a go in Hollywood. Overall, it was a fun, hilarious experience that none-the-less seemed fairly realistic in some ways both for the writing gig stuff, the dating stuff, and the real world stuff. Definitely hits true for the writer gig a few times, rather painfully so even, at least from my limited experience. Also seems to have a good amount of elements tracked behind the scenes, which I really like - I've always kind of felt that in game stat screens for character stats and romantic interest while a commonality to most games presented a lot of surreality, so kind of liked that those things were present but secret for this game.
Honestly had some trouble coming up with cons to the game - its early access, what I'd assume is just the first episode of the game, so it is relatively short. The price tag is sadly about average for these sorts of games these days. Now, some of you may not like that there is really no sexual content that I am aware of at least, from my play through at least. Honestly, I'm fine with that; likely some in future episodes, though I don't think there needs to be a ton. A stronger story and immerisve experience makes up for any short coming there, easily.

combat - most combat are fast and wont take you more then 10m

pay to win - the game revolves around heros/operators/avatars etc.. and every one got their own weapons/stats and passive effect unlock that you can share among other heros/operators/avatars etc.. 
here is the problem
some heros/operators/avatars etc.. cost alot of money to unlock (around 20$) so if a new ones will come out and their got a broken passive buff then the payers will get a huge advantage by being able to unlock and use it first.

classes - 2 classes are almost always full as they got the best weapons and more fun(assault and sniper) while the other 2 are almost always on half or less
mainly the support class that is out right at 20% at all time from what i saw(some support class have 0 spare magazines, that kind of brake the point of cover fire that is pointless anyway because the lmg will do next to no damage to enemies that are far and if you shot a sniper he will just take your 2 points of damage and 1 shot you back)

Gameplay looks slightly smoothier than in FX3.
And I'm out of pros actually.
Most of positive reviewers will write that a lot of reviews are just complains about prices - and that is true!
But let's face things: you won't like to play only free tables and tablepass that devs give you is just a mockery, because, it don't even grant access to all tables! Some of them allow just 2 minute trial mode!
And that's why this is a review with complaining about price policy.
I don't want to pay MORE for EXACT SAME tables that are present in FX3 (majority of which I bought during Xmas sale in 2022) and I can't recommend to do this to anyone, unless you have irresistible desire to spend your money ""just because"". The legacy bundles costs just unfair in my opinion. Again, I compared Ghost Rider table in FX and in FX3 and it feels just the same - maybe, just maybe, Williams tables worth to pay again for them. I just wasn't prepared that tablepass will be  activated instantly upon receiving and I can't play a lot during workday.
Also, would be nice to highlight that the prices on tables in ewwwwwwgs is lower that in Steam (after a year of being an exclusive) which is also embarrassing.

And so, in the end, we have nice update of the platform, which works fine on portable devices. More smooth gameplay. But without tables - it just lose sense to jump in this version, especially, if you have plenty of great table owned in FX3. I think, you won't miss a thing.",0.0

As a veteran to the roguelike genre, this game is definitely more tricky than the usual roguelike I have played, however, it's definitely a game you can consistently do well in. On my first run alone, I made it pass the second boss. Now, I have beaten the true final boss in only 8 hours of playing with 10 total runs played. What I've learned is that healing is notoriously a tried and tested strategy to guarantee you will make it far. But you should also focus on doing 4 things: racking up money (usually from combo kills and money event space) so that you can buy crowns to set up your forces and combos asap, taking events in this priority order - Money/Shop>Helper(if it isnt capped)>Card removal>Relic>Chest (card reward), focus on 1 type of synergy for your deck that corresponds to your clan, and do not take any cards with side effect with them. If you take these things into account, you'll make it far even if you make a mistake or didn't plan well.

What you need to do is switch between two scenes, find items and use them at the right spot. Scenes are very tiny and usually have one or two items and some piece of furniture that can be opened. 

Red herrings that reset the entire puzzle make the puzzles a little trickier. These can take the form of a puppy that jumps out when the door is opened, an electric outlet that shocks you, and even a ghost lady looking out of a well.

Certain situations are incredibly intriguing and unexpected. Although some scenarios are repeated, each problem contains enough fresh material to keep you from ever feeling as though you have seen it before.

1492,136645653.0,1811990,"I don't typically take the time to review a game. I think this is one of those very rare occasions when I should.

I got this game because I love deck builder games. Slay the Spire MTG you know what I mean. This game starts out so easy to learn, so fun and wholesome. The music and graphics are fun and upbeat. I even had an absolute blast playing it while I did. 

16 play hours later and over 70 straight losses and I cannot help but wonder if there is a code to counter your deck in particular instances to increase the length of the game and if that bugged out on some of us because there cannot possibly be a perfect counter every single run.

Others have mentioned it, you build a deck type and you WILL face the direct counter to it. Now you may think, ""I can just overcome the counter, right?"" Your hope of beating the decks that have literally been designed to destroy you is 0. My best attempt against a hard counter got me a through a wave and a half. Not even close. This has happened over 70 times. 

You might think I just have trouble with hard games. Well for reference I loved and fully beat Bloodborne, Darkest Dungeon, Demon Souls, Enter the Gungeon among others. Those are punishing games and I adored them.

People complaining about the difficulty are being absurd. It´s what actually makes this game fun! The choices you make, the paths you take, the cards you upgrade, what you play, how you position your troops, it ALL IS VITAL and will change the outcome of your run! 

People want games with meaningful choices and strategy but once they make bad decisions, they call it too difficult. 
80% of my runs have failed because I made a dumb decision and the game punished me for it. This makes it super fun, though. With every run I´ve unlocked new things, keeping the content fresh! And with every dumb choice I make, I learn from my mistakes and get further in the next attempt.

The tribes you can play are incredibly varied and play very differently. 
Heroes, companions, charms and cards with a dozen varying effects make combos and strategies super fun and somewhat unique every run.
The progressive unlocking of cards, charms (card upgrades), companions keeps the incentive to re-run interesting and high.

My only complaint is that some effects are somewhat unclear and require testing to understand. A few of my runs were ruined by this issue. Part of the learning process but it would also just be easier if it was specified how certain effects affect results. Same thing with not being able to see if you´ve reached your companion limit. Other than that, all groovy!

I can only recommend!!!",1.0
1499,136735539.0,1811990,"After playing this game for 15 hours I feel I can give my honest opinion on it. This game reminds me a lot of Slay the Spire and The Darkest Dungeon, with how strategic you need to be and with some level of RNG that's involved. However, I will say this game looks and feels quite polished compared to the two, as it feels more fluid. The art style is quite nice to look at and the story/characters you come along as interesting as a whole. However, if I had one thing to say about this game to sum it up, it's that it's very very difficult. It took me a good few hours just to figure out a few mechanics that aren’t told to you, and the learning curve is very steep for new players. I'm not a god at the game but if you take your time to figure out different combinations and paths you can take it's very rewarding. I would say that perhaps it is too harsh for newcomers to this type of game and the beginning can be more forgiving, however other than that I do enjoy this quite a bit, and I do believe everyone should give it a try at least once.

The physics are so good that I drain about as fast as I do on the real machines... and that's not a bad thing!

In its current state, the game could use some optimization on some lesser hardware and there is a strange issue where there is occasional input lag that can be quite frustrating, but it's not common enough to be a deal breaker and somethign that should probably be ironed out in future patches.

The only feature that feels sorely missing is VR support. Anybody who has ever experienced pinball in VR is probably aware that it's a bummer going back to a flat screen where you just never get the perfect camera angle versus feeling like you are actually standing at a real 3D machine using your head naturally as the camera. If this feature isn't added by the developers, there is at least an upcoming mod being worked on that will make VR possible soon.

however as much as i enjoy this game, their remains a problem of players using wall hacks, not to shoot through walls or anything but to know your position some may disagree with this, but having witnessed it in multiple matches it is their, and some people are using it, as to which it get's to a point of this just isn't fun, so i enjoy this but find myself being put off playing it with the fact that in 6 hours of play i have encountered around 4-5 people using said cheats, 
that is the only con to this game,

the playerbase are all really friendly and get along except for the ones who forget to unmute all of us have done it at least once XD.

the gunplay is nice and smooth the movement and all is good, they also have a shooting range available at the menu where you select what you wish to do just turn left, their is also a pre-lobby between matches with basketball, a bar, and just a place to interact with teammates and the opposition.

 £25 was a steep jump in price for what is currently their but as they add to the game the price would 100% be worth it, provided they start dealing with these cheaters, permanent bans would be the way showing them if they wish to cheat they have to purchase it again on a new account, i do recommend the game if you dont mind running into those sorts of people occasionally, but if that sorta thing really get's to you i'd avoid at that point, this is just my opinion",1.0

1547,136741934.0,1811990,"The game really doesn't feel fair to play.

I have a LOT of hours into Slay the Spire, Roguebook, and many other card games. It is entirely unbalanced, there's basically no point in withdrawing cards into the pouch to heal them, as there's zero chance you'll still be alive by the time you can use them again.

Your start is entirely random, and you will outright lose almost every game based on the selection of leaders and misc crap you are then given.

In something like Slay the Spire, Roguebook, or Monster Train, if you lose MOST of the time it is due to a misplay, or not following through on a strategy. Occasionally or rarely it is due to bad luck. In this game, there's no way to (consistently) heal your character, and you get one of three choices of leaders, all of which are usually bad in my experience, they either do no damage, have aimless (which will mean when they DO attack they attack at random), or are just mediocre. If your leader dies the run ends. Enemies have very high HP, you will get to pick between 1-2 cards generally between fights, every fight has a boss, and depending on the RNG of what you draw at the start, you can lose pretty much from the get-go.

For example, I get no snowballs (the only way to delay enemy turns), no allies, and am fighting the monkey boss. One of the minor enemy monkeys has 8 hp, attacks every round, and gains 1 damage every round starting from zero. The problem? In my case it takes 4 turns for my character to attack for 4 damage, they have like 9 hp, in that timespan the monkey has hit me for 6 damage, and if I had no attack cards it is only at half hp, while i am down to 3 hp, with no consistent way to heal.

Keep in mind there'll be another like 5 enemies that will spawn in during that time, and on the round I can attack, I'll be attacked by the boss, the monkey that is much stronger than the boss, and all the other misc. enemies.",0.0

1574,136740635.0,1651560,"So far the game has a strange hold on my brain. I love it. Its cutesy art style and relaxed approach to gameplay are refreshing. Its missing a lot of content right now, but that's only because its in Early Access, but what's here is currently very good. For someone who plays a lot of city builders, and played this game's demo extensively, there's a few hours of content. For a more casual audience I'd say there's easily double what I got.",1.0
1575,136740497.0,1651560,"Cute is an understatement for this game. It still lacks features and content but thats somewhat okay i guess, since it's early access. It was fun playing this though and i have high hopes regarding the further development and the roadmap. Please don't disappoint me. Unpolished gem right now. Perfect for winding down though.",1.0
1576,136740118.0,1651560,"There's a great foundation which also uses (foundation's) territorial system here but some stuff is lacking per say , pacing is tacky and some stuff is just weird.

Pro's - Unique systems and charming laid back art direction its super charming + relaxing. There's lots of potential here (hopefully it delivers)

Con's - pacing is tacky - to put it mildly  the concept is there for food and gold etc. which are kinda basic , but the timing and cost of it encourages a super slow play style which might not be for everyone.

Desirability - buildings have upkeep and certain heavier industries give or reduce desirability/beauty of a certain spot. Having high desirability increases happiness of the housing in the area- leading to a faster immigration rate i think at least) but really don't affect anything besides that so far.

Cost- The cost of buildings lends to its slow play style , buildings are pricey at the start and taxes are fixed, ie the initial farm of vegetables cost you 225 gold for the max of 40 fields, a single homestead for 3 peasants (2 workers) costs about 55 gold , with a ratio of 2-3 peasant houses giving enough cash to reach double digits + support the upkeep of one building that needs it.


Food- It aint fully there yet, (fish comes in the future updates it says) + each food type gives its own number of food needs fulfilled . I.e wheat requires 2 processes to become bread - but has about double the food fulfillment compared to vegetables which don't need any processes to be used. The main problem is the ratio of the wheat products - you need 2 or 3 wheat units for one unit of flour, but 4 flour for 1 unit of bread, or just 4 units of wheat for pork (requiring a herd), this means essentially a super high scaling cost of a 1000 or more to get it to a stable supply for the next tier of citizens .

1578,136739618.0,1651560,"So I was looking for a new city sim kind of game, you know something to pass a little time and loose myself in. Now what we need to remember is this is a game that is in early access but that being said.... I sank 6 hours into this no problem. There is understandably quite a bit locked in game at the moment. Honestly though this runs super smooth, is peaceful and the mechanics aren't too hard to understand if you have played this type of game before. Yes the animations may seem a little ""childish"" but for me this added a lot to the charm of the game. A solid game and can't wait to see what else they do to it. 
Would highly recommend for anyone that loves this style of game.",1.0

The characters are all unique and super fun to play, and the gameplay is smooth as butter. I can already tell I'm gonna sink hours into trying to beat all the bosses and unlocking everything. Plus, the devs have already laid out their plans for upcoming content, so we can expect even more cool stuff by the summer!",1.0
1580,136742889.0,1183800,"So far a very nice game with a lot of tactical depth, there are somethings that I think could be improved:

1. Actions like venting, overwatch etc. that all characters share should always be on the same button, so it becomes more intuitive to do the right action without checking the UI
2. Its almost impossible to tell how far an enemy could be walking and whether or not he could be in range to attack your characters on the next turn, would be good if you could see their walking/attack range when hovering or selecting enemies
3. Would be nice to have a UI scaling setting, so that texts are a bit easier to read on bigger screens
4. Like others already mentioned, having some way of deciding the walking path (or automatic routing around dangers) would be helpful

I will let you know if I find anything else :)",1.0
1581,136740332.0,1968710,"This game is very fun, it is basically ultrakill and cluster truck combined into one game. The sound track is really good and there is a lot of potential to replay the game by doing speed runs (leader-boards open on April 27th) and doing different difficulties or if you really want to just use the kick. Overall I think the price tag is a good spot at the games current state. The campaign is not that long currently but I believe the devs said they would extend it. There are a few minor bugs but nothing game changing. Overall I would recommend this game to almost everyone, it is a fun fast paced shooter that combines ultrakill and cluster truck into one great game.",1.0

1588,136739782.0,2380240,"Overall a short boring walking simulator, barely any horror in the game at all. Got stuck at a point where I had to shoot on a solid door that apparently was one way-glass with a really small ""fragile"" text in the bottom of it. Before that I walked back and forth trying to figure out if it was some kind of puzzle element with the 2 switches in the game which you could turn on and off, the only thing that did was confuse me making me believe one had to be turned on and the other off to progress.

When I played the game I was forced to join the discord and type a stupid command to get a code if i wanted to progress in the game. This has apparently been fixed now in a recent patch which is a good thing.
There is nothing chasing you 97% of the game, the only ""chase"" sequence is in the end in a maze which lasts about 1 minute.
I would say the graphics, sound and lighting are the only good things with this game and the fact that it is free. 
The developers have another game upcoming based on this so I would like to assume this is a kind of demo of the upcoming game but if that is the case I think it should be stated on the store page which gives you less expectations of an actual game.",0.0

this game is incredible. if Slay the Spire is deckbuilder Dark Souls, Wildfrost is Sekiro. Come in thinking you can dodge roll to victory and you'll get wrecked.

It's very difficult and mistakes are punishing but in my opinion this is a big part of what makes it so addictive!  It's crazy to me that anyone would leave a negative review as clearly a ton of thought and effort went into this game. Aside from a couple bugs I've encountered (mostly related to the smackback mechanic?) it is a great time, and I'm sure even those issues will be ironed out shortly.  Highly recommended!

I played WOW regularly for 17 years - yes 17 years and finally got so used to it it started becoming boring so is why I was looking for something to take it's place and this game is it.  Give it a solid try and I think you will see the fun and enjoyment from it.  It's not a first shooter by any means which personally I don't care for anyway it's kinda layed back and peaceful.

The gun play, audio and graphics are amazing and so long updates are release this game is 100% worth it. If you are sceptical then i would advise waiting for several months for the state of the game as it exits early access but from what i can see the future of the game looks promising.

Played the Demo of Boundary a few months back, and i was highly impressed, on how good the game worked in this early phase. I barely never played any Early Access game, which felt more finished, like this one. Sure, it definitely needs more ""maps"", more guns, more astronauts, but performace wise, it's already in a really good condition. If you like shooters, but you are on the search for something new, give it a try.

The game is amazing, gunplay is very fun and the mechanics are very cool, definitely something that i see myself playing a lot.

1622,136743147.0,1649740,"Hunt the Night is a souls inspired 2D action RPG with some platforming and shooting elements. It is a relatively short game that can be beaten in around 10 hours but can be further extended if you are going for 100% or new game+. below are some short pros and cons for the game.

PROS:
- The controls are responsive and dodge timings are tight but intuitive.
- The shifting between melee and gun combat is pretty nice and the ammo system is not to punishing
- Aside from 1 boss [spoiler] mother [/spoiler], I find them to be fun, have good auditory and visual cues, and have amazing designs.
- The enemy scaling is pretty good, you can beat the game with the starting equipment on a first playthrough.
- I know people are pretty mixed on this, but I really liked the puzzles as it doesn't hand hold you and 1 of them was down right cryptic.
CONS:
- I find most of the mechanics underdeveloped, I never use grenades as they are too clunky and deal little to no damage; the crossbow is inferior to the pistol and shotgun; and poison and burn don't deal enough damage or proc enough to warrant a build dedicated to them.
- Exploration is a pain in the ass. You don't have map or a collectible checklist, and a good portion of the early game is a swamp that needed a special unlock to traverse through.
- Story is pretty mediocre; I wasn't really invested, and the lore is pretty much all over the place.
- Music is okay, I wasn't impressed nor disappointed.
- Some bounty bosses are buggy; I bum rushed 2 of them and they died getting stun-locked by sword slashes.

Overall, I find the game enjoyable, albeit unpolished for the most part. If you are looking for a short game to binge through, but still want a decent challenge, then I highly recommend playing this game.",1.0

1628,136743514.0,1183800,"An absolute blast. If you're familiar with XCOM - which I assume you are if you're looking at this game - you'll feel right at home with the core combat. Where it differs is that in this game, I feel so much more agency when it comes to how my unit hit. There are several ways to improve your hit chances and make it much more likely that you'll connect, to the point where I almost never worry about taking a shot unless I'm basically certain it'll connect. Variability comes with damage, enemy armor, and use of cover and clever tactics. There's also a resource management element where you need to collect loot as you fight and flee, so that you can heal or upgrade in between fights. The core loop is just perfect. It also has a nice aesthetic, and an intriguing world. The narrative does seem simplistic, but it's a good enough framing device to get you in the action.

If you've played the original 20 years ago, it'll send you on a trip down memory lane like smelling an old candle you used to love as a kid. At this time of the review i'm done with one of the 10 games and here are some notable change worth mentioning:

- Gameplay is just as smooth as the original, it's a great port on that regard
- Art Gallery, Music Player, they're fine whatever, you'll spend 5 mins in there and be over it. Mostly nice to see once.

Game Buster Max breaks the game. It takes away every challenge. Which if you're a veteran and simply want to speed through the game I guess is fine, also if you want to speed up grinding for chip collection, but I find myself with the Batman corollary as in, if i use it now, why not use it all the time? And well, it kills every enemies in less than seconds can count on your end battle report card. If it's your first time playing the game, please don't turn on this feature, it takes away a lot of how amazing the battle system in this franchise is. 

Beyond that, it's the same as the games on Gameboy Advance, except now you get access to the rare chips from the start and there's achievements to accomplish which adds flavor. 

I haven't tried trading or PvP, frankly said I usually stay away from such features in all my game, but i appreciate the inclusion for those who may enjoy it more than I do. A very fun game worth the full collection price if you care to support the franchise.",1.0

So having played in the open alpha and beta play tests, and now owning the game since release. I would say it's a pretty decent game as it stands and I do recommend getting it for yourself. (At the time of writing this the game has only been out for barely two days and more updates are to come so keep this in mind.)

Here's a couple of things I've noticed since launch.

[b]1.) Spacial Audio Issues [/b]
Now since the play tests to the now fully released game, I will admit the audio has gotten loads better. But there is definitely still some issues when it comes to hearing your team members foot steps much easier than the enemy's foot steps, even when they're almost right next to you. The audio for team and enemy foot steps should either be the same volume, or switched.

[b]2.) Where'd the Compass go? [/b]
There was a compass that used to be attached to your wrist making it easier for you to communicate with your team mates as to which direction to enter the building from (attacking), or say where they're entering from (defending). I haven't fully gone through the settings again to see if they've made it so you can toggle it on your wrist or not yet so this might change.

[b]3.) No Tutorial for New Players [/b]
At this current moment in time the only way for someone to learn the game is ""trial by fire"" in a sense. They're basically having to rely on team members to understand the game mechanics and how they work. Even something like tool tips would be helpful, and maybe just adding a toggle in the settings to disable them.

[b]4.) Gun Play [/b]
The gun play is actually quite nice for a newer VR Tact-Shooter, and it's quite refreshing if I'm being honest. It's very rewarding for hitting head shots. So for all the VR shooter head hunters out there, you'll have a great time with this game.

[b]5.) The Community [/b]
The community is absolutely amazing. Obviously you're going to run into kids being this game is on both PCVR and Quest. But when you're in the right lobby, it could be the highlight of your day (or the absolute rock bottom depending on which side you got).


[h2]T.L.D.R. [/h2]

With Breachers only having been released for two days, for what it is I couldn't recommend it more right now. It is honestly enjoyable (all be it with the issues it has). As stated prior the community is great, the developers are working hard on updating the game while talking with the community and getting their input as to what people want/like the most about the game.

The second issue is that the game is random about what cards it gives you, but there aren't enough to pick from or maybe just enough in general because trying to build to apply a specific status or do a specific thing is almost impossible and many of the quests require you to do so in order to complete them.

1712,136753374.0,307950,"I have played Caliber since August 2022 prior to the Steam launch.

Great game overall for being F2P, good PVE/PVP 3rd person gameplay if you're looking for something that is similar to Ghost Recon Phantoms (RIP) or the old SOCOM games. 
Continuous regular updates for bugfixes/balancing and good communication with the Caliber team on discord.
Wasn't expecting much from it when I first started as it just seemed like one of those lower budget random foreign games but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of it (graphics are good, lots of different mechanics, somewhat authentic operator designs from multiple different countries that you can tell the devs researched with some effort, etc). 

As it is F2P, has a lot of monetization stuff to make your progress a lot quicker, which is annoying but expected of course. It is ""pay for convenience"" but not ""pay to win"".

Pros:
- Graphics and character designs are pretty good.
- Gameplay variety (has PVE, PVPVE, PVP and limited special gamemodes)
- PVE isn't super easy even on lowest difficulty (you will die if you aren't paying attention or taking cover)
- Large variety of different operators with different abilities, you have to level up operators by playing them to improve their abilities and make them more viable. Different operators have different play-styles and strategy.
- Good communication with Caliber team (I personally saw a design error on an operator skin with an upside down NVG mount, brought it up on Discord with a screenshot, and the design was fixed within an update or two).
- Very fun when playing as team and actually communicating. Bring your friends. Sometimes sucks though if solo-queuing and your team has braindeads/leavers or doesn't communicate at all.

Cons:
- A lot of monetization that reduces your grinding. It is expected as game is F2P, but some of the real money prices for certain things are super high, such as $10-20 USD for a new operator to play (there are currently 68 operators, some are more expensive than others). You can grind for ingame credits by winning and doing challenges but it will probably take a couple days to grind out enough to buy one operator. I believe when you start out and do all the tutorials and stuff you have enough for a few operators to start out with though. Try them out at the Firing Range before you decide on what to buy / play as for awhile if you aren't going to drop real cash on the game.
- Often has toxic players in PVP who get mad and quit if you lose a round (annoying, as this game is 4v4 you will be at a significant disadvantage).
- High ping if you aren't in Russia. I believe this is less of a problem now as they have added back in US and EU servers.
- Some balancing issues with operators.
- Battlepass system is weird. Very expensive, comes in multiple different parts that are paid for separately, takes awhile to level, and the operators obtained from the end of the battlepass are unobtainable once the battlepass ends for a long while (months), in which they finally open up to being purchased by real money or credits.

1726,136754742.0,2328760,"Pinball FX is a great game that builds on previous iterations. Some of the 
biggest improvements you will notice are in the physics department and with the graphics 
and lighting. I am a seasoned digital pinball player and can tell you this is by far the closest
this game has come to having realistic physics. For me, the physics are what really sold
me on this title and I have played it since its first release on the Epic Games Store.
When you play digital pinball games, realistic physics can go a long way because 
it challenges you to make good shots and rewards you when you do but also punishes
you when you don't. In FX3, for example, the physics felt like the ball had a predetermined path
(especially on the Zen tables) which is why I played the Williams titles for the majority of my playtime.
That is not the case with Pinball FX and because of the physics overhaul, I am finding myself enjoying
titles from FX3 that I didn't have much interest in before. 
The second biggest improvement is the lighting and animations that you will notice while you are playing.
The Williams tables received a glow update that improved lighting specifically around the flashers which was
very noticeable.

If you are coming from FX3, the physics will feel a lot different at first and it will take getting used to because
it's a different engine but you will notice how much more ""realistic"" they feel the more you play.
Lastly, the amount of tables Pinball FX offers is actually quite insane. There is something for everyone. For old
timers like myself, I enjoy playing the Williams recreations the most but because of the renewed physics,
I am also enjoying original titles like Crypt of the Necrodancer a lot.

It's also a story about love and expectations while also murdering monsters and helping save the kingdoms across the land.  Avoiding spoilers I remember it having a decent story although some NPCs were... annoying but that's to be expected.  The music is also a bit different than what you'd expect for a fantasy rpg but it is good, the enemies challenging enough without being cheap, and the boss designs can get very much out there but in a good/unnerving way.

Compared to other RPGs there's some QoL features like visible displays to see where hidden treasure is lying (although treasure chests can be hard to spot behind some object) and now there's an optional guide system.  Alchemic item/gear crafting is pretty straightforward and not too material demanding although some drops may be hard to come by.

1771,136756710.0,1811990,"Wildfrost is a near 10/10 rogueLIKE deckbuilder with fantastic visuals, a gloriously catchy battle theme (especially in the first area) and meaningful/impactful decisions that drastically affect how you perform in your run.

Addressing many of the negative reviews (its okay to genuinely not like the game of course) which state how absurdly difficult the combat and balancing is:
The the combat plays a bit like Slay the Spire but the few battles and heavy inter/intra-battle decision making is much more akin to something like Monster Train; If you make one or two big mistakes you WILL be punished rather hard. But the opposite is also true. Big combo plays and making an almost degenerative deck can have you crushing through monsters with relative ease.

Yes the game can be brutal. Yes the leaders aren't super consistent with choice at the beginning of the run. Building a deck, deciding if you needs charms or crowns, deciding if your starter cards should be munched....these are all things to consider while looking at your cards special abilities and those of the enemy. So for all those struggling, let me give a few tips that may help you engage with the game a little better, rather than just write it off as ""bad hard game.""

1. If you can safely go for combo kills, do it. That little bit of money adds up, especially if you want to blow it all on the charm vending machine.

2. To meta progress, hit escape at find the achievements menu. Try and clear these to unlock various cards, charms and events.

3. You can and should be moving your cards around in battle as direct responses to the battle situation every single turn. With this in mind, if the battle is almost over, use this chance to recall some of your more damaged companions so they will not incur the ""injury"" debuff for next round. Also, your leader always full heals after every battle. Use this knowledge wisely to tank hits. Essentially, you want to be winning each battle as closely as possible to leader death. 

4. Save your charms until right before a battle. You may find another card later on that synergizes with the charm better. Or you may pick a card to work with a powerful charm.

5. READ. THE. DANG. CARDS. Tooltips are there for a reason. Right click on cards to see more stats so you may better plan.

6. Go slow, have fun. No need to rush, take your time and plan out moves.",1.0

1785,136755971.0,1527950,"First thing I want to say is that the game isn't awful, but it isn't great currently either. My reasons are that the story isn't really a story it doesn't feel like, they seem more like side quests to which you can choose to either help one side or the other. During these ""story missions"" you can kind of just go around the map and find them at locations which to me isn't too great, the reason being you don't get much backstory into the factions I am only on second story line but so far i haven't found a faction or group i really care about. The other thing from what I can tell (not tried but seems like can do this) is you never get locked in to helping a faction so i could do all the other factions quests for one side but get to the end back-stab the group I have been helping and others will think I am a hero.

Second is that the world is vast but very limited. I have travailed around and generally speaking all I can do is craft, kill, hunt (same as killing though), steal (which seems kind of pointless), explore few dungeons or bandit camps and do quests given at towns which are generally same as stuff listed above. 

Some ideas for more to do could be that like maybe getting your own town or village or castle to which you can have mercs with their own party limit (garrison) which could maybe go out and do assignments or just store your loot and you need to improve the structure there and that could get attacked. 

Maybe like a sandbox mode where you could actually be hired by a lord or group in wars against the other territories basically like a TRPG mountain blade get own territory or help lords take more and maybe raiding. 

More dungeons for sure from what I can tell is 1 dungeon area per location.

More character interaction like randomly generated backstories or interactions beyond the 3 choice interaction already have. I have fair few members and I know none of their names they die I don't really care just off to the town for another.

That's just some ideas bit stumped at what else could be added honestly but I just feel needs to be more variety or a more engaging story.

Combat in the game is alright I have had a few lag moments at start of playing or reloading in but nothing major. Combat can be fairly tactical but it is mostly thinking who is going first seeing what roles they have and dealing with ones you hate the most. If you play adaptive mode though the one where everything scales as you do then you need to think about everything every fight is just brutal. Got a farmer with his pitchfork and rags, you got heavy armour big shield and sharp stabby sword well ... that pitchfork was forged in dragon fire baby and it going to just pierce right through. 

The other mode though where they level per area is much easier so I would play that honestly I restarted my whole campaign because the other mode was just brutal, it got to the point where I was either losing a person every fight or near death. Clearing out a strong bandit camp just seemed like was impossible because they always have equal or more troops due to reinforcement and same or higher stats.

When comes to food, money and happiness I never had a problem honestly my party currently is 2 ponies and 10 people and i haven't struggled once with any of it to give an idea i still have 10D worth of food and 1.5k Krowns. Generally all you want is money get money buy food buy salt cook food feed them pay them and they happy to murder whoever.

That's my overview I am going to play the game to completion I don't think the game is like the worst thing to ever be made but it does feel like it drags on and is limited to what you can do I think it can become something really good it just needs more stuff to do, more engagement and fleshed out lore and backstories of places and people and a better story really but that could be too late to work on now so perhaps the other areas.

Score 5/10 currently good but needs more

1789,136757491.0,2328760,"First off, let me start by saying that I adored zen releases in the past, (mainly fx3, the deals they offered on bundles, ease of use and incredibly smooth gameplay) and ended up buying 99/100 tables, though I know there are more from lost licenses I was very pleased with the amount I spent. I never found Indiana Jones to be worth 3x the other tables, so I didnt purchase it. Then we get the announcement that a new, remastered game was coming in hot from Zen studios named Pinball FX that would be exclusive to Epic games for exactly 1 year. Here is where things started to go sour, with no option to move any tables or receive any vouchers from Zen to make the transition seamless. While I understood this gesture, I didnt understand why that also came with an awful version of the game, on Epic. Nearly unplayable. I accepted this and simply moved back to fx3, which I did not mind as I already had quite the collection of games to keep me busy.  Moving forward 1 year, we get the Steam release and to my incredible surprise, the game plays quite flawlessly albeit missing a native resolution (3840x1080, which worked flawlessly in fx3. 2560x1080 is the resolution I use in the meantime, which gives pretty significant black bars on both sides of the screen, and a slight downgrade on the resolution that shows a bit of jaggedness, no matter, the game still plays great). The game also now comes with an integrated orientation swapping setting, which is awesome and actually works on my screen, nearly looks like a full size pinball machine. So after exhausting my 1 day of free pinball pass, which is also a nice gesture, I looked to see if there were any options to swap my fx3 tables to no avail. Again, new engine, physics, graphics, which are all great, so I really dont mind paying for the tables I dont own on fx3 already,  HOWEVER, while this new version of the game is an incredibly well done version of what we have come to love over the years in fx3, I feel like it is pretty scummy to expect any sort of payment for tables that people own on your ""abandoned"" platform, fx3, in your new game, pinball FX. The people who would end up continuing to support your game into the future, are the same ones you are looking right in the eye and saying ""pay again"". No thanks. Great game, great remaster, awesome tables, scummy, SCUMMY tactics. I wont be recommending this game to anyone until they find a way to shake the hand of those who have supported their previous iterations for so long.

The amount of Characters, Weapons, and Upgrades, will surely make you plan your meta first! You don't just go on in and shooty-shoot. Even in the beginning of your playthrough, there is a per-level upgrade choices and Shop that you can pick and access so that you can strategize your gameplan or your chosen meta.

You start of in a level select, weird with no introduction, but alright. I hit new game and got brought instantly in the game, graphics are fine but have this weird effect on them.
It felt pretty good moving around, most objects could be picked up and there was text showing me exactly what to do, or at least trying to tell me. The text showing where the eviction notice was was fine for the first level or two, but after that i felt it was fairly annoying seeing all the time. There could have been an option for it, but as said earlier, the graphics had a weird effect on them, and text was hard to read.

It was alright going through at first, but there was little to no variation, go and pick up the poem (optional) and then throw the eviction notice off. It quickly became bland and boring, as the map was only changing a bit.

The audio was meh at best. ""with stunning visuals and lifelike sound effects that fully immerse the players in the experience."" The only audio that i vividly remember is the music that just cuts off if you're in a level for too long. No variation in the audio either. Not even a sound effect for picking up a poem or throwing the eviction notice off.

The graphics as told earlier had a weird effect, but were fine. Immersive enough, but not better than anything like Boneworks, Pavlov or H3VR. Looking down though, you see a very undetailed ""map"" of the construction people? If you fall down, then it renders with better quality, but you're not falling down all the time.

Controls were fine, grabbing onto most things is more than a few games can say. I was confused though when grabbing the handle of a drawer grabbed the entire drawer. You grab onto the entire model instead of just bits of it, which was unfortunate and sad. Also wish they had more things, triggers didn't even do anything other than just twitch the index finger.

There was a bug apparent too, hands getting stuck in things was not fun. You just get stuck there and have to twitch yourself a lot to fix it. Also, in a level, you started just by falling to the bottom of a container. I'm usually fine to falling, but not when its unexpected, nothing from stopping me from playing, but pretty bad for others if they can't expect it.

Those were my main gripes about the game, but why include achievements if you're only going to have one that's given from starting up the game?

I think this type of movement could be better utilised in a climbing game, or something of the sort. I would be more fine with most of these things if it was free, because free things don't usually expect quality, but having to pay, even if it's a low price is setting the standard higher. I think a few patches could maybe fix up some of these complaints though, but the game in its current form, is more bad than good.",0.0
1827,136761203.0,1498040,"Пример того, как можно взять хорошую идею и сделать ее еще лучше.

Био-прототип - это клон vampire survivors (на самом деле, бротато, но пофиг), где все способности и предметы сделаны в виде внутренних органов, которые отращивает наш мутант.

Органы делятся на две группы, ""рабочие"", которые что-то делают, и ""соединительные"", которые выступают в качестве перемычек между рабочими и активируют орган при определенном условии.  Еще органы бывают разных типов - например, щупальца стреляют, конечности наносят урон в ближнем бою, детеныши плодятся, позвоночник активирует следующий за ним орган, а глаз - активирует следующий орган, если предыдущий нанес урон противнику. Из этого всего, как из конструктора, нужно собирать организм своего мутанта, причем органы лепятся друг к другу не просто так, а по определенным правилам.

В качестве корня выступает мозг, к нему можно приделать, например, позвоночник, который будет что-то активировать раз в несколько секунд. Добавим щупальце - будем стрелять пульками. Прилепим к щупальцу нерв, а к нерву коготь - и каждая пулька при попадании будет бить когтем вокруг себя.
Можно сделать хитрее: к позвоночнику приделаем детенышей, детенышам дадим кишечник и мешочек с ядом - и теперь они будут создавать лужи ядовитой жидкости. А во второй слот поставим им еще один позвоночник, к нему щупальце стреляющее по спирали, на щупальце повесим глаз, а к глазу - паутинную железу, которая выпускает паутинку в детеныша и наносит урон всем кто с ней столкнется - теперь каждый детеныш будет выпускать по несколько пулек, которые будут летать по спирали и резать паутиной всех, кто окажется между ними и детенышем.

Сначала эти крылья, ноги и хвосты вызывают головную боль, но стоит лишь немного разобраться - и из очередного  horde survival игра превращается в развлечение ""собери мутанта с самыми безумными механиками"".

1828,136761840.0,1811990,"I have beaten the game once and here are my thoughts.

Now first off is Wildfrost a good game?

Very. It is quite fun and really makes you think.

Is the balance flawed?

Very.

Some builds simply do not work and in most instances even if you are going for a build that can work you are reliant on specific units (in my case spice flag and the weaken damage charm I likely could have won without any of the other buffs on Mika but without being able to increase her combo reliably and maintain spice I would have had no win condition viable with what was given to me.) Often you just do not get the pieces you need to make a build work. For example say you get a unit in the shadow tribe that doubles afterburn.

Cool I'll do an afterburn build.

Sometimes you won't get any afterburn applying cards.

2 x 0 = 0

This happens a lot in this game, and there is little means to manage it.

You can win and skill is important there are no per say FREE wins here but sometimes if the game isn't giving you the pieces you need you just kinda lose.

You may think you can reroll or skip cards.

None of that no you get 3 good luck fucker.

There aren't even many chances to take cards in the first place, you get around 6 before the first boss and if you don't have a good basis for your build by the time ya reach the area after that boss you are unlikley to survive.

There are also times the game can feel overwhelming with like up to 10 counters on screen and units to move around. It can often feel like a bunch of spinning plates even with a decent playable build.

In other games you can make a couple mistakes and still one, but in Wildfrost one missed position or one forgotten enemy who attacked one turn sooner than you planned for is a run ender.

The game is more overwhelming and has less wiggle room than anything else.

This isn't without pros it really makes you think which is great but it can be frustrating.

Not to hammer home the comparison but if I misplay once in Slay The Spire I can still recover, there is risk reward and one bad roll on that risk or one unblocked attack is not the end of a run granted it does punish you.

Here that one misplay does end a run and this can be frustrating especially when you simply didn't get the combo pieces you needed.

Some builds I feel are underpowered are sacrifice builds for the shadow tribe and shell/healing builds.

For sacrifice builds you need multiple specific card or a main hero that can summon (which btw heroes are rng so good luck with that) otherwise it doesn't work even when t does it ramps up far to slowly to be useful often needing 2 cards played to do one thing even with some decent synergies.

Healing and shell aka armor don't work cause means to apply healing or armor are to slow and in a game where enemies can in some cases one hit you they are not very helpful.

There are cases they can work but the scaling on them is VERY slow and dependent on getting very particular cards, in addition most healing cards have low max hp so one would assume that you could mix the two to cover that but most shield applying cards deal damage or lower your max hp so that's some pretty hard anti synergy.

How am I gonna use a healer with 4 max hp when most enemies have 6+ attack?

And they heal two?

See above point.

The real issue in my opinion is how punishing the game is compared to others and how dependent you can be on card rng in particular when you have so few chances to try to get other cards every draw really counts.",1.0

I am glad that I did. Only played it for 9 hours so far, beat the game only once. So its not easy and sometimes you get surprised by how abilities interact, but you die and you learn. So this is not an easy game, but dang its fun. There are many different ways you can go about finding a win condition and so far few runs looked similar (You have to make work what you get and the choices didnt feel forced, but I dont know what I am doing yet). Kind of like when I started with slay the spire, until you figure out what works and what the great synergies are. The artstyle is cute and I like it.

1831,136761550.0,1811990,"I don't normally review but the skew of positive/negative reviews seems insane considering how high quality this product is.

Difficulty: This is most people's main gripe but if you love a challenge with rogue like deckbuilders, then Wildfrost is excellent. It is harder to begin with than Monster Train or Slay the Spire but this difficulty eases up as you unlock more features. Sadly the features take a while to unlock, but are very easy unlocks that encourage you to try out all styles of play in the game. Once you beat the game (and the first difficulty was easily beatable in 5 or so hours) you can add modifiers to increase the difficulty. Personally, I cannot stand rogue likes that are too easy and make you grind through countless ascension levels just to become a challenge. For me, Wildfrost hit the balance of challenge right, otherwise it simply would not be a good game if you won every time.

Graphic and Design: Impeccable, succinct and streamlined.

Balance: This could do with some shakeups as certain playstyles  do feel imbalanced and easier to get results with. However, the game is well balanced with a ton of variety in enemies.

I highly recommend this to any deckbuilder veterans.

Wildfrost is a well executed roguelike deckbuilder with an engaging gameplay loop, clean and cute designs, interesting core mechanics, and a variety of valid strategies. As many others have already stated, the game is difficult but definitely not unbeatable or (imo) unbalanced. The game requires careful consideration and planning during battles which might mean taking a few minutes per turn every now and again. From my personal experience, most of my runs have ended owing to faulty decision on my end rather than unbeatable enemy encounters. It is not only vital to collect cards that synergize but also to have answers for various enemy types and situations in your deck. 

Overall, if you have played and enjoyed similar games, I can wholeheartedly recommend Wildfrost and I truly hope that the unwarranted percentage of negative reviews does not rob the game of the attetion it deserves.",1.0

1835,136762192.0,307950,"After having played for 23 hours and getting a good grip with the game I can recomend it. The game is fun, the gunplay is good, not the best I've seen but still good and for a change it actually has PVE modes (imagine a game that does that in 2023, it's almost as if the developers wanted the game to have success). I played  the PVP and PVEVP to try once for the rewards but honestly I'm not a fan of anything with PVP, however it seemed just fine though take my opinion on the PVP content with a grain of salt.

The buisness model seems fairish. The prices are a bit high for cosmetics in my opinion but it seems fine otherwise. It's is playable free and I really don't believe that buying anything is required at all. You can gain XP faster if you have premium but because your money will not progress anywhere nearly as fast as your XP, grinding the money is the real deal and therefore you don't even need premium. Something could be said about being able to spend real money for the in game money trade which reminds me of the aweful rates of WoT and such (this game used to be tied to wargamming not sure if it still is) but overall it seems alright.

The negatives points from my perspective are in the customisation. Characters are gender locked and though other skins exist they are always the same gender. This is a big let down for me and since the gender makes no different in the gameplay, it would be better to allow everyone to play whatever gender they want, even if through a skin. If they lowered the prices but made many skins of different genders it could easily become a good revenue source.

Another thing that you can't customise is your loadout. You can swap your cosumables to some minor degree and chose whether or not to add the fixed upgrades you unlock for your guns. You don't get to chose what scopes you have and what silencers you have and different mag types and so on. I believe this will let down a lot of players and though it would change the gameplay a bit, especially with the mags I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to balance. Another let down is how all scopes are fixed zoom (at least I haven't seen them being able to zoom in and out but I could have missed it).

All in all, it's still a fun game and it's free so give it a try, it won't cost you anything.",1.0

I believe the goal of the maps was to move towards a yellow mineral which moved me to a different map with other blips on the map. Walking through trees is possible, and I saw no collision detection. The deer I was controlling had very strange colours, and the deer had a slight animation problems when it was running up or down hills. I would have preferred a more natural looking deer. The most off putting thing is when walking up or down a hill and the immobile camera showed the underside of the hill. The sky coloured bottom below my deer and short line of land separating my deer from falling forever wasn't relaxing to see. My deer didn't fall through the land though, so big plus.

1849,136762209.0,2328760,"TLDR: Bring some stonking good PC hardware for the raytracing & HDR benefits, otherwise you may as well stick to FX3 for the time being, until further optimisations are made.

My vote could go either way on Pinball FX at the present moment.  My own *personal* experience would lean toward a highly-qualified ""recommended"", but only because I have a rather powerful gaming PC and an HDR display that can do this title justice.  I have an 11th gen i7 processor and a RTX 3070Ti GPU with a 144hz Gsync 1440p HDR display... which is upper mid-tier hardware atm.  I can run Pinball FX with Raytracing and HDR enabled in Portrait/TATE mode at @100-120 fps.... at 70% display scaling (1080p effectively).  This isn't as bad as it sounds, because it would seem that display scaling doesn't not affect rendered element in a linear fashion.  The playfield texture resolution, for example, seems to maintain 100% (or close) resolution even at 70% scaling, so it's really only the 3D ramps/rails and raytracing elements that seem to lose definition with the reduced scaling.

The point is - expect that you'll need to compromise on some settings if you have anything less than an RTX 4090 gpu.  To my mind, 60fps is simply not good enough for natural-feeling pinball.  You will probably have to turn down some settings to hit a smooth, flowing, responsive FPS.  I find that it needs at least a more-or-less consistent 90 FPS before it starts looking/feeling good.  120 FPS or higher is buttery smooth.  And of course, you need to have Vsync disabled, or you will feel the input lag.  Which also means that your display will require variable refresh rate  (VRR/GSync/FreeSync) or you will experience tearing.  Some of this is not Pinball FX's fault, to be fair.

This new Pinball FX has exactly 2 things going for it, as compared to the previous Pinball FX3: raytraced lighting and HDR support.  The updated physics are... fine... but I thought they were fine before.  If your PC hardware doesn't have some serious heft to it in order to push raytracing and HDR... well, then... you might as well stick to FX3 imo.

But, with raytracing and HDR enabled.... wow.  I mean, it really is quite visually stunning!  Being able to play my two favourite IRL tables of all time in Pinball FX (Twilight Zone and The Addams Family), in portrait mode, with raytracing and HDR enabled.  That's the stuff of my dreams - it's really, really excellent.  I would massively recommend THAT experience.  But you won't get THAT experience unless you come packing a behemoth of a dedicated PC gaming rig, and that's the main reason I can't give a thumbs-up right now.

Pinball FX doesn't currently support AMD FSR 2.0 (or higher - 3.0 is releasing soon) and it doesn't support DLSS.  So, enabling raytracing on support hardware will cut your FPS *BY HALF* -seriously!  It feels like a lot more people could enjoy these tables the way they're meant to be enjoyed if this software were to support current upscaling technologies.  Also, Pinball FX claims to finally support custom camera settings for each table.  That's only slightly true.  The settings are incredibly limited to just a few broad camera tilt adjustments at the moment.  That's not proper custom camera support.  Pinball FX claims to have cabinet settings for a separate backglass and DMD positioning.  But if you enable it, the application drops from fullscreen into borderless windowed mode, meaning you're stuck with Windows always-enabled Vsync (input lag!) and a 60 FPS cap.  Lame!

There's a lot of potential here for the developers to implement performance-saving image upscaling methods, more granular display settings, proper custom camera settings, and more.  If they do, then I will change my review and give my full heartfelt recommendation.  But, as it stands today, proceed with caution.

as someone who's played and owned all the old cartridges back in the day, let me say this release has been a bit of a dream come true. 

QoL changes, AI upscale filter for my old eyes, everything I know and love is in here + extra.

If you do the math the way I did at $60 USD, each game, including the alternate versions (3 White/Blue, 4RedSun/BlueMoon, 5Proto/Colonel, 6Gregar/Falzar) you absolutely SHOULD play both versions as they contain entirely separate characters in the story that you'll face off against. so to get the entire Battle Network 3 experience you'll need to play both Blue and White, etc. 

based on this alone I already justified the purchase as a steal at $6 per game, with working Online Multiplayer functions. They imported that Japanese exclusive Battle Chips that were only given away during promotions and the only way to get them in America was to use a GameShark or ActionReplay

2: Is this a good game/franchise to get into

oh my god, yeah, this is really good shit. 10/10.
an action RPG, with card battler elements, and fast-paced battles with a strategic 3x3 grid layout. 

The combat is the coolest and hardest thing to describe and it's only after you mess around with the intricate systems and start virus busting and building out your chip library and finding cool Program Advances that you really get a feel for it and it becomes so rewarding and enjoyable. 

if any part of you is even considering playing this or is a little bit curious; definitely check it out. These games are so near and dear to me and they will always have a special place in my heart.

Tray Racers is a really fun procedurally generated party racing game. There are currently 2 game modes (not sure if there will be more in the future): time trials and racing lobbies. Up to 16 people can race in a lobby, and because the tracks are randomized, it always feels like you have a chance at winning since it's not like anyone gets the advantage of practicing before you. The way the races work is you get 5 minutes of practice all together and then one final race. The winners are determined by both the practice trial times and the final race time.

I played this game on stream as well and had chat members join in for races, and it was extremely fun and everyone had a great time. Tray Racers oozes charm and the surprise of ""what comes next"" with each race keeps everyone's attention.

1900,136765319.0,1364020,"I do recommend this game, but not now. Best to wishlist and wait for the game to be in a better state.

My thoughts so far on the game:

The Good:
- The gunplay is amazing! No weapon is too strong or too weak.
- Movement is also a solid plus. Can be a bit clunky at times, but gets better with practice.
- Operators in game have stats and abilities that are unique to them, loadout options are pretty flexible.
- No Astrophysics PhD required!

The Bad:
- No region locked servers, so it's practically guaranteed that you'll encounter players above 300 ping.
- Uses ACE anti-cheat, which can be a red flag for some people.
- Operator abilities have 0 description on how they work, so you're basically forced to figure it out for yourself.
- Some maps are small, other maps are way too large. Some maps are predominantly indoors, other maps demand fighting out in the open.
- An in-game currency (obtained as a reward for leveling up) which, at the time of writing this review, has no use whatsoever.

1926,136765134.0,2367980,"[i]The Witch, Wife, & the Wish[/i] is a very short single-read novel without any choices that will take less than 30 minutes to read from start to finish.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Westley is a married man whose wife is lost to him.  She is suffering from a malady which means she cannot remember him.  So he leaves his village to visit a witch in a nearby enchanted forest; a witch who “sells” wish fulfilment in order to make a living.

He asks her to cure his wife so that they can live happily together again.  What transpires is a very bittersweet narrative which builds the relationship between customer (Westley) and supplier (Charlotte, the witch) before revealing the truth – which, in itself, is very easy to pre-empt just by absorbing the initial exchanges.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
Despite its extreme brevity, by keeping it very simple and focusing on only the two main players (although a 3rd person does appear briefly) and the one story thread, the writer successfully creates a false depth which makes the leads endearing and has the reader supporting them.

For a free game, both graphics and sound are fine.  Graphically simple, with a slight blur on the background which fits the atmosphere.

The English isn't [i]quite[/i] perfect, but it's close enough to not matter.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
For me, the game opened in a small window covering about one quarter of the screen.  I found that odd.

There's no “back” button, although there is a good log.

The text speed is preset, so sometimes you're waiting for it to finish before reading or moving on, as it is not instant.

At the end of the story, it simply says “The End”, and you have to X in the top corner to close it.

It is literally so short that the story itself remains unresolved.  I'd add that this is as opposed to unfinished, it's clearly meant to be left “open”, but as the writer successfully makes one care about the characters, it's a pity that there isn't a properly satisfactory conclusion.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
It's nice, sweet, and for less than the time it takes to wait while dinner cooks, it fills time pleasantly when you have a little gap that isn't long enough to do anything else.  It's definitely worth a visit, it won't cost you anything except a few minutes that you probably wouldn't use more constructively anyway if you found the opportunity to look in the first place.

Quite an easy recommendation, this one.

TL:DR
Negative review = Skill issue",1.0
1935,136769095.0,1811990,"The negative reviews for this game are extremely misleading but common issues are understandable here. However: it's entirely unfair to negative-review bomb a game to this degree. When I want somethings' reputation to suffer, it's because the product is failing to function as a game: crashing, undeveloped, you know, it feels like crap and plays like crap

This game runs clean, all content is extremely well implemented and balanced, and the charming atmosphere is polished to a standard that most game studios never achieve. This game is well-loved and well worth the price, especially the soundtrack. There are many effective deck-strategies that are as fun as they are different from another. What I'm trying to say is, the reviews requesting balance changes appear to be from a misguided consensus conversation happening elsewhere, probably on a reddit, because it's not reflected here in the game.

The reasons for the disconnect between players and the games current state are better explained by the two problems that are confusing players. 

1. Many mechanics are simply not clearly explained, leaving the player surprised at the results of some actions listed on the cards. This is a serious issue, I've had entire runs ruined by a single turn and it was frustrating to learn 'the hard way' how something works. This problem can be fixed easily and the developer will likely straighten the verbiage out soon. Keep in mind that smaller game studios will have these issues without a AAA QA team, Not worth a negative review though.

2. There is a steep learning curve using aforementioned unclear mechanics. This problem becomes far less punishing after you've unlocked most of the content after several runs. I've won multiple times now but only after many losses. This is also a serious problem and likely why players are bouncing off the game. Expect your first runs to be losses . My recommendation would be for the developer to create a shorter adventure track that earns double rewards until you unlock the second tribe, just to give newer players a fair shot at beating the entire gameloop before they hit the grind.

Despite those problems, this game is immensely satisfying and rewards clever planning and synergizing
I hope this review can persuade you that this is a diamond of a deckbuilder currently buried beneath a pile of snow. The reviews telling you it's an unbalanced mess, i.e 'the game is doomed because the foundation of balance is crap from the beginning', are totally inaccurate.

Due to that, instead of playing the style I feel like, I feel that I'm constantly pushed to either switch styles every run or reset until I get a decent leader (which takes a lot of steps for something the equivalent of a reroll button) This is especially frustrating when trying to unlock everything or hunt achievements.",0.0

Cons-The narrative aspect is at odds with the gameplay.

1970,136767329.0,1183800,"A very charming XCOM-like, but it is *not* kidding around. I regularly play XCOM 2 on Legendary, and even Normal difficulty here is a significant challenge. I'm sure synergies and optimal strategies will emerge over time as I gain experience, but just know that it's not watered down. 

The primary difference to XCOM-style engagements is that the ultimate goal is escape, not victory. The more loot and remaining HP you escape with, the better. But the game often forces you to prioritize HP, loot, or XP over each other with no neat answers. It also runs on autosaves, which disallows save-scumming and really ratchets up the tension.

1. The game is ~35 minutes long.

3. Melee, sniper, kamikaze, just three enemies, all roughly at same health, no particular strategies about them. Some vehicular bosses but no helicopters to shoot or whatever.
4. [b]You don't need to kill anything[/b].  Far too many enemies constantly spawning anyway. Just dash forward with the hook to skip to next level, killing enemies is pointless. It's consistently easy to out-regenerate them on Normal.
5. All guns feel the same. You can kick people with your foot, or don't. You can also kill them with the hook I guess. Doesn't matter. No depth to combat whatsoever.
6. Physics have this wonky Unity feel to them. Some objects are surprisingly not solid at all (especially on the final level, but all destroyed vehicles are also super wonky).
7. Technical issues (game freezing at loading screens, not preserving the selected language, framerate issues on one level). They'll probably get fixed but they aren't now.

1982,136767901.0,2273470,"this game, even for a prologue, has a lot that it needs to improve. currently there is no displayed way to skip time for any more than 3 hours(technically three hours because of glue drying time option)  so delivery set for two days is agonizingly long and pointless for a prologue; fortunately there's a delivery speed setting that can be changed, but i haven't noticed any difference using it yet. not only that, but there are barely any graphics settings for performance, and it has a lot of room for improvement with realism. painting on different layers in this game is not realistic at all, and this comes from someone whose father has half a dozen guitars and has watched a couple of his guitars been painted before. 

overall for the game, however, is very bright in its potential. i see this game as having a very promising future in its release, but as for the prologue, it's very rusty and confusing. the tutorial isn't the most help in the process, and you oftentimes have to figure out things on your own.

so to conclude, is this game good and flexible? not very much, but it has lots of room for improvement and plenty of time to fix itself. just currently, it feels like a lower-quality type of simulator game that has to do with building things, partially due to the non-realistic aspects of some steps taken during assembly. the full game without a doubt is going to be better than this unless the developer(s) don't make any changes to the process of each order in the game.",0.0

Adding animation to make it to where people can't spam the reload to quickly similar to pavlov could be a great way of implementing this. I feel reloading is a core experience to a vr shooter. I also think weapon skins and character skins would be cool to add in the future for completing milestones. The game is already $30 so I think paying for cosmetics could be hit or miss, if paid ones are in the game I think some should be added to be earned from milestones (challenges) Of course new maps in the future should be added, but the 3 we have now are fun so far. You should be able to hold items in your hands so when the new round starts you can hand things to your teammates, you survived the round you should keep all items.

One of the things I loved most about Unscripted is the way the game allows the player to make choices that have a real impact on the story, I am mostly talking about the River path. There are a few choices I haven't expected to go that way, so I had to Save before, and check them on later.

So far, there is a lot that I really like about the game, but one major thing that has impacted my enjoyment. I have pretty sensitive eyes and can get eye strain easily. The issue is this: the camera sensitivity in the game is TOO TOO sensitive, which means it's very easy to get eye fatigue, feel nauseated, etc. I literally turned my camera sensitivity to zero and turned off head bob and could only manage two hours of gameplay before I had too bad of a headache to continue.

1993,136771988.0,1811990,"The visuals are fantastic and the game involves lots of tactical opportunities. Most mistakes feel very punishing and hard to recover from which makes you focus on most decisions.
There seems to be tons of varieties to be had with the different factions and tons of different main characters randomized for each run. Some of these options are very easy to master but some way way way less so.

Unfortunately like many people say there are some balance issues and some runs are guaranteed lost early cause there was nothing else that you could do provided with what the run got you.
While this is a factor in other roguelites like Slay the Spire that many people compare it to, it isn't nearly as prevalent there as it is in this game.

When it comes to locations that you visit during your run, it feels like that is one of the games greatest shortcomings.
Because the power level that they provide to the team is also very drastic.
You pretty much always want to upgrade your cards, if that location isn't available then you want to get money so that you potentially can get a shop so that you can upgrade your cards even more. 
But there are some terrible upgrades in the sense that they are extremely situational like reducing the attack of your cards and giving a special type of hp that only can be applied to certain creatures.
Getting good upgrades feel essential for a good run cause some of the upgrades are really awesome
Some locations are unlocked later in the game that gives you some options, but from my experience upgrades are key.

Even after all these negative aspects, I'm still enjoying myself. Combat feels like a puzzle because you don't want your allies to die because then the next fight will be harder and you don't want your main character to tank too much and die because then the run is over. When it all looks over and you realize that you can survive one turn more and it just snowballs into a win is one of the best feelings to have in this game,
You move around your team constantly to get the best types of attack and defense, it just works so well!

If you get this game, try to go in with an open mind and don’t expect to get a win or go very far. There is some rng that can feel devastating, like the enemy having a single minion that can wipe your entire team cause you had no way to play around it or even worse that the enemy makes 3 random attacks and your main character goes from full hp to zero resulting in a loss. But in the end all you can do is try again until it works.

This game definitely doesn't deserve to have Mixed reviews cause it can be so much fun and it has tons of potential.

2003,136770464.0,307950,"Caliber is a third person shooter with abilities and gadgets feeling mostly unique across the 64 operators available in the game. I have been playing this game for exactly 1 year since April 2022 and in that time, I have seen the game shaped for the better. The developers have been very receptive to the community feedback and are constantly improving on the game. There have been numerous changes to the economy, operators, matchmaking, and finally the inclusion of NA, SA, LATM, and EU servers on steam.

PROS:
•	The game is free to play and costs nothing for the user to get into the game. Players have a complete range of content to choose from for all game modes and over 60 operators.
•	Operators can be leveled up for 15 levels and have a nonlinear trait progression where you can select a trait/passive for each level as you progress.
•	There are four different roles to choose from and the PVP matchmaking allows you to select any number of 16 operators for each of the roles. 
•	There are skills that can be unlocked and selected from each operator. You can select the 4 different skills to run on your operator as additional passives. The skills can be changed on the fly before the start of your game, just after the operator selection phase. This allows you to choose a set of skills based on the map or enemy operator choices making the game feel dynamic with a depth of options to choose from.
•	There are executions and emotes that are top notch. You can pick up your enemy and slap them in the face to finish off/execute them. I'm adding this in here because it truly is one of the best things that I've ever seen in any video game. It must be the most disrespectful way to execute someone.
•	Reserves cost nothing and you are given them free at the start of every game.
•	There is no lean peeking in the game which lends itself to a more effective TTK.
•	TTK is in a great place for the majority of the operators.
•	This is a TPS which involves a lot of gun skill. It is easy to get into and play as a new player of TPS games.
•	Games are only 5-10 minutes long with 2- or 3-minute rounds and first to 3. This means the games are over and done quickly. It’s easy to pick up and put back down again.
•	Developers are open to feedback and are working tirelessly to produce all of the changes that were requested over the last year.

CONS:
•	The games sometimes feel too short leaving me wanting a bit more. I would consider adding more rounds to the game modes to give a bit more time in a match.
•	Some of the operators (especially medics) can feel hopeless when you match up against very tanky supports. I’ve heard some criticism about a few specific operators feeling like they’re shooting marshmallows. The problem with this is buyers’ remorse and players not being happy with their selection of operator. This happens in every game and can be difficult for players to get over. 
•	With a game having 60 operators, there are balancing issues because it’s very hard to balance 60 operators equally without a couple feeling unfair. Currently there are about 15 or so operators that stand out among the pack and have become the “go to” operators for the game. I would like to see other operators that are weaker get buffs to bring them closer in line with the best operators.
•	The BattlePass is not available at certain times. The BattlePass should always be available and give players the option to buy those operators. Additionally, these operators should be able to be purchased for a larger number of credits which should be reduced to a normal amount of credits when the next BattlePass comes out.
•	The amount of time it takes to get an operator to level 15 can feel a bit overwhelming and grindy. But I would like to point out that you do not need to get every character to level 15 when there are only 15 or so that are considered the top of the pack. This reduces the grind considerably. I would like to see the amount of credits that players earn increase a little bit.

Conclusion:
I know that a lot of players would say this game is pay-to-win and that was (past tense) previously the case before they did the economy rework. I think that the changes that they have made over the last year have really moved the game into a great place where players can get anything in the game as long as they spend the time playing it. With the new Daily and Weekly objective system and all the new player exclusive benefits, players can earn their first few operators very quickly. Additionally, for those completionist who want every operator unlocked, there is always something to grind for. The game’s hit registration feels very crisp, and gunplay is the most important aspect in this game. The 60 different skills, 15 different traits, 4 different reserves, and 60 different operators give the game a depth that will pique your interest and constantly keep the game fresh. As someone who normally doesn’t like TPS games, this TPS game is at the top of the list and will easily become a main stay.",1.0

Be wary: THERE IS NO REAL COOP IN THIS GAME, it was added with the same idea in mind - ""lets add something that are not fun and doesn't work just because Battle Brothers don't have that"".

There is a beautiful 3D world. Where nothing is randomized, so replayability is very low.
There is plot. With quests where you ""sorta"" have a choice, but in reality you don't, as decisions are forced on you, and it won't affect anything storywise anyway after you do 4 quests in a region.
There is crafting with clicking minigames. That's okay, but i'm really bored clicking on circles for 100th time. And you can craft gear with only the most basic abilities, which you don't want to use, believe me.
Combat is fun for the first 10 hours, then it became sleep fest as the damage doesn't scale too much, ""fast"" combat animation isn't really fast, and it took forever to finish a turn with 8+ companions. There are no zones of control and no 
matter how thick your frontline is, AI will sneak though it, so no chokepoints for you except rare cases of map generation. Also, fire is very !FUN! mechanic (no).
Arenas are pure cancer. Wanted and suspicion mechanics are annoying and is not fun. Trading is nonexistent. Regions are alike. Scaling is unfair - I guess that won't be an issue if I play on regional difficulty, but I won't start the game from the beginning, as there is literally no replay value and I will make the exact same things for 17 hours.

Good. . . ish is probably the best way to describe my experience with Hunt the Night. On the surface it has a lot of things working for it that, in theory are fun, but it doesn't quite seem to know what do do with those mechanics. This game is sort of a shotgun scatter of different ideas that are loaded into it but never really seem to reach their true potential. 

The combat is sufficient, but the enemies don't really telegraph their moves so much as you learn the patterns and then just get the timing down. Enemies who shoot projectiles are almost easier to deal with than anything with a melee moveset. 

The exploration is fine, but the lack of a map means that a lot of the areas sort of just blend together and it's hard to get a sense of where you are at times. 

Power progression is strange in this game. It doesn't really exist. The weapons don't feel like they do enough to differentiate themselves from one another, the spells feel generally lacking, and the most direct upgrades are all to tertiary systems. Health is tied to optional hunts, finding sanguine altars, and your gear. It feels strange to have 3 direct ways of influencing your maximum health. It might have felt better if the altars increased your base strength or did something else other than just increase your max health because the optional hunts already do that too. Stats are all sort of okay. Hemostasis causes your attacks to heal you and Plagus is just a poison DoT. Those are the only two, and Hemostatis is objectively better because of the limited healing resources. 

Overall this game feels like a bite-sized version of a more full experience, and that has nothing to do with the actual length of the game. It's moreso that there's less nuance with the subsystems in the game than I expected. The campaign of the game is there, but the rest of it is still stuck in an early access stage. Some things should have been left out, while others should have been expanded. The traversal with Umbra is one of those things. It just doesn't feel fun, and it breaks the pacing of the exploration too much.

The music and art are good. There's clearly a lot of passion put into the lore and world overall. The gameplay just leans into being  good enough, and so the game winds up feeling 'good-ish'. 

A very light recommendation from me. I think it's price point saves it in this regard.",1.0

I contacted them in email, (no reply) but in discord they responded and said its been an issue they're aware of and that they will work on it asap since they were gathering as much info as possible. I worked with them, sent them copies of my dxdiag. Tried some things they suggested. So i left the demo on a positive note, thinking it'll be bugfixed before release.

However,
I recently bought it, and copies as gifts for friends.
Sadly, I thought the issue was addressed. It was not.
Same issue. Crashing around the 20 minute mark.

It is so fast-paced I would wager most people start and finish this game in one sitting. This is very possible because the game's campaign, as it were, only takes about 40 minutes to complete (I took 45, though I died a few times). There is also an infinite mode though, which is a good addition that adds to replayability.

At this price point for me its a biiit lean for my liking and in spite of how much I enjoyed the time I had with the game, I initially considered refunding it since I had thought this was all we were going to get until a MEATGRINDER 2 due the lack of an Early Access tag. Thankfully however, I saw I had made a mistake, because the devs have said in a Discussions post that they are actively working on new levels and achievements to add in the near future. I hope the game gets fleshed out significantly more in subsequent updates because I can't wait to return to grind more MEAT!!!

1. Unlocking weapons is too difficult, I don't even know how to other then a basic idea of killing a boss with a weapon and getting that weapon afterwards.
2. The zombies (And ESPECIALLY bosses) are relentless, and sometimes during blood moons they will just KNOW where you are. Keep in mind I've gone out of my way to avoid this by closing all the doors of the house i'm in, sitting in a room with no windows relatively in the center of the house, and they still find you.
Bosses have it much worse, they will follow you and follow you for eternity, even if you die or suicide.
3. The bosses are WAAAY to difficult. I just quit the game during the Riot Boss fight during the second phase. It literally has a gun and even 150 damage is barely even a few pixels of his HP bar.
4. Literally every single Rifle is underpowered, even the RAREST rifles. This normally wouldn't be too much of a problem in an Open Alpha, but the rarity of rifles combined with the fact that most use Sniper Ammo, the most RARE ammo, makes it a huge issue.

Although there's some UX issues I've stumbled upon I expect them to be fixed and the whole game to be improved upon in the future, even though the team who created the game is small, I will be more than happy to support this game and excitingly wait for future updates.

2065,136773224.0,1811990,"To be clear I like this game close to love but it has a few balancing issues that i cant get over currently and this is why i'm post a negative till its balanced out. As of this review i have 11 hours into this game and almost all unlocks in town and have beaten the game once but as stated some issues i do want to point out to hope they get adjusted or fixed out right that will make this game better to new comers and over all. I will also state the reason for each negative and leave spoilers out of the review till the end to be clear.

Pros
- Mechanics: out of all the deck builder's and roguelikes i have played it stands out and is fun most times.

- Keywords: All are great and add fun aspects to them except for two of them explained later.

- Clans: Cool and distinct to one another.

- End game: Mechanic on how it plays the first time and home it gets harder is super cool and unique.

- Events/Pathing: Simple and impactful.

- Enemies/encounter: Fun and cool that they are themed.

-Sound: The game sounds great to play with and relax.

-The inventors Hut: feels great to unlock and start using.
Negatives
- Keywords: 
          - Aimless: is fine for the player to use but as for the enemy it feels unfair from as low as sometimes to out right unfair. The reason is that once the leader is low or even has low hp to start it feels unfair when you can't stop aimless from snipping the leader in just the short 11 hours i have played i have had to many runs end because the aimless seemed to only aim at the leader and i was unable to kill all 5 of them on the field by the time they did snipe my leader just does not feel good as a player to leave so many enemies to attack randomly. To fix this i suggest just adding a indicator when you hover over them to where they plan on attacking keep it random but show us where it is landing if the players line up stays the same if changed because of another attack changing the players lay out then the enemy changes target location or something to the like allowing it to feel a bit more fair because i knew where it was attacking or have a bit less enemies with aimless 
          - Overburn: To be fair over burn on allies are fine and the enemies that have it is also fine the issue is mainly the ending and how that works knowing that i had a god run as my 4-5 run where i beat the final boss with no issue but now with the endgame mechanic i'm stuck with dealing with a over HP god run boss that once he gets to attack i loss because the amount of overburn i get in that one attack it is just over( to be clear my boss has 54hp and 8 overburn with barrage and with most allies and leaders having low hp pools that's a wipe on that row but the other allies also are problems with 2 willows, berry sis with teeth charm, big berry, 2 plums, and 2 Vesta's (glad they lost double overburn)don't know if hp matters for allies but you try to kill this team before they can attack i wait.) the issue is that overburn on a player is fine but keeping as high on the final boss is bafulling and currently ended 10 runs a few with ink but not a good way to obtain make sit to hard to have by then. My suggestion just if they have overburn half the amount.

- Clans: Clans are great the issue comes with the cards you can get because you have 3 clans but dont lock off the cards that arnt from the leaders clan leads to too many different archetypes competing to be in the players deck it's a simple fix  by having all allies you save being a 2/3 being from the players selected leader at all times making it be more consistent for the playes deck and there skill being needed to beat each fight not luck on a good ally being in the deck and not junk compared to your leader just sucks having a game where i only got allies that apply demonize but have only low attack leaders that dont really get to take advantage of it.

-Store/event: The only issue that i have is that it feels a bit odd that the store sells random charms and the event sells them out right i feel like either the store should also sell charms out right just 1-2 or they should switch this is just a personal thing and i know that don't know how others feel about it just does not make since to me that the store does not sell any at all.

-Leader: The leader system is cool but i feel like you need to give the player a additional reward for there leader when completing a boss where they get stronger and not just the game charm this mainly comes from me having an issue with the final boss i have right now just a small increase like they get more damage because they found a better weapon more health because better cloths or food for more energy to attack sooner and then remove the ability to add charms or restrict it to 1 or something similar may need a good amount of testing but it just sucks having a leader that dies in one hit late game.

-Charms: only issue is having no way of getting rid of charms you won't/cant use, allow us to sell them because having a scrap charm when your deck is summons based. Sucks even more when you don't even see another way to allow you to use it.

-Boss Charm: I don't know if they are more because of said issue but the first one should only affect 1 ally each fight because i lost a few match's where a minion with 9 attack got frenzy and was in the back line while one with teeth charm was in the front just felt unfair that the enemy had more charms then i did and since they are all minion related they are almost all better for them unlike my charm that i got randomly that i could not use yet.

- Unlocks: the unlocks don't feel great to unlock because they don't really impact your run as they should so far i have only bought one from a store and have yet to choose one for my deck because they don't seem as impactful as they should be.

-Pets: pets feel fine but i feel like they need a bit more adjustment they should be a good ally but feel like garbage and a waste of a turn sometimes to play.

-Hot Spring: Most of these allies feel bad to use in most cases considering you had to unlock them and they are barely as good as other allies you already have. 

I really like this game and want it to be great so i'm posting this as a thing to know about and can look into at least to improve the game but being a game designer i understand the troubles of balance and designing but keep it up you guys have a great game here and i want to keep playing it.

However, you can't even display them the way you want because they don't let you mix collectibles from different tables (unless they're from the same genre of pinball tables).

Tables can only be changed so much until they are not real life comparisons.

Some also are deterred by the fact that Pinball FX3 (and its engine) is over 5 years old at this point and shifted to unreal, giving people some decent discounts (or even free transfers) on tables they have previously released (PinballFX2->Pinball FX3) for quite some time. Be wise on your selections.

the content may be identical, but they have been updated and nobody does all their work for free,
so why should you expect to get something for free because of the decision you made?
(facts are facts about issues, but that doesn't mean you can complain when it isn't warranted :) )

You aren't going to get EVERYTHING transferred over for free. You've seen Dark Souls: Remastered, and other games that have been released at the time.
This is why most games that do remasters give discounts (sometimes generous/deep) to the owners of the previous versions. Zen does this in their own way while bringing new tables in on top of that.

Remember: this game is free to play, free to start, to anyone and everyone can make a review here, and this just came to steam.

-Very fun to play! Not a lot of players yet so it's hard to get a full match, and there definitely doesn't seem to be a system to balance teams, so you WILL have 5vs2 matches.

-Maps are decent but everything kind of blends together shape and color wise, so orientation is a bit hard to get used at first to with the additional axis of mobility.

Controllers:  (Why? A: not using a desk B: Ergo...) 

- ADS is the same for all guns whether it's a pistol or a sniper, which does technically make sense being in space but, it makes swapping weapons mid game basically impossible without changing the setting every time.

 - Can't swap weapons and automatically return to ADS. (personal, but still seems like an oversight when trying to make a fluid control scheme.)

- Don't know if this is a controller specific thing, but once I'm on a surface it feels like I'm stuck to it unless I do some odd moves to get off and away from it.

Something fast paced, with great music, wonderful visuals and a satisfying sense of power, that kind of quick power trip is so therapeutic, you just need it sometimes, to kill boredom, anxiety, depression, you name it, maiming it in the digital space has always helped my people. 

This feels like one of those great games you would pick up on the weekend, even if you beat it on a sitting, you would play that thing over and over, well, at least us 90s kids would. Man, I wish kids today knew how to have fun, it sucks that fun is missing from so many peoples lives...

2115,136775336.0,1727270,"Great movie, bad gameplay.

To be honest I am super conflicted about my opinion on the game. Let's start with the good. You get all the D'Avekki goodness. These excellent British actors that (from a couch) bring you into a mysterious town which oozes atmosphere. You get all the D'Avekki tropes... Aislinn De'Ath playing a lady to die for, Rupert Booth voicing the policeman, Cameo-Girl gets a bigger cameo this time and so on. As a fan of D'Avekki, it feels like the family has yet again brought you another wonderful few hours to lose yourself in - and I'm pretty greatful for that. Tim has also learned to not overdo it with the jumpcuts this time^^. Compared to the other titles, the characters are a bit less subtle and a bit more on the nose this time. But the tone has been hit very well. 
If there's one complaint I can bring forward in terms of the whole world-building then it's that for the first time, then, for the first time in a D'Avekki game, the lore has been spiked with animal cruelties, which for me personally is something that drains the enjoyment out of the game. In fact I'm quite angry about that, and especially Sally's remarks in that regard makes this game trash-bin material for me. For me, it's a biggy, but I'm aware this will be irrelevant to most players.

Anyway, let's address the elephant in the room - the gameplay. Now one D'Avekki trope is certainly to take bad UI design and make it the sole gameplay loop. Which kinda works weirdly enough for most of the games, this time though, it's a bit too cumbersome.

So, there are 6 suspects in the game. There are three days, at each day, each suspect will be asked one question by the police, which amounts to ""are you guilty in this aspect"" and the subject will answer with yes, no or maybe. You pick out the person, which answered yes to all three and tadaaa... you win.
All other information is irrelevant. It's unimportant who had the strongest motive and who would be the most capable or just any other background information. It's just these three questions and their answers that matter.

Where the irrelevant fluff information gets used is in unlocking these police questions. Each suspect has three fluff-topics which need to be activated in order. To do that, you hang a painting onto a slot with the corresponding topic and a cutscene will play. The contents are irrelevant, you just need to match the topic. The painting have an ammo-counter, which needs reloading after 6 questions and ammo is scarce. So you can't just ask them all the topics. And the other thing that happens is that the slot will change to show another topic now.
It's not difficult, it's not challanging, it's not compelling, it's not deep, it's just annoying. It feels like they didn't want to make it perfectly easy, so they put the topic-change mechanic in and they wanted the possiblity for the player to fail so they put the ammo-counter in.

Now there are some secrets and some unlocks on repeated play-throughs. So, you're incentivised to play through the game multiple times. There's some randomization going on, but really, even that is done very half-backed, you see the assets not lining up perfetly and so on. Speaking of assets, which the artworks and videos are pretty great, the regular textures and environment certainly aren't. I dig the idea of the art gallery, but the execution is... questionable. Also of course, controls aren't rebindable and a lot of options, such as the fov-slider lack don't show their values.

So, to summerize, this game is an odd mix of the very good and the very bad. It's something where new ground was tested and some aspects sink and some swim. While the atmosphere is stellar, the gameplay is just nothing I could honestly recommend. If you're a fan, I won't read this and will have bought this anyway, which is fine. But if you're new and haven't played the other games yet, start with those.",0.0

You get what you start with and need to make the best of it, which might allow you to think outside of the box.
Take some time to think about each play before you make it, simple.

Now with that out of the way, learning the game can take sometime at first, I think that makes it rewarding in terms of feeding your brain. Chuckle Fish made a banger which was Starbound, I knew I had to buy this because I trust the team and card games have been my kick lately.
And they didn't disappoint.

The game is perfectly balanced, it's just a skill issue for a lot of players who are too lazy to learn something out of their comfort zone.

I",1.0
2119,136776751.0,1811990,"I've been playing since it released a few days ago, and the first thing that stands out is the charming, welcoming presentation. The game rides that fun and cutesy atmosphere as a counter to its (current) lack of balance in player agency and difficulty curve during the course of a run.

I gave this a positive score because the devs have stated they're looking at balance, accessibility, and the difficulty curve in their first few patches, and I'm glad they're taking action. I'm also having fun with the various synergies and strategies that are available. That said, I'd also like to have fun while having a chance at making it further in the game. As of yet, I usually die to the first boss. When I do make it past the first boss (either snowman or monkey) I usually die to the first battle past that point. On the rare occasion I make it past that first battle (usually the purple fellas), that area boss wipes me out in seconds as my party is wounded and my map options unhelpful.

First problem: The leader selection is completely underwhelming. Each leader is a random set of variables that either add up to being a potential burden to your team, or a massive boon that establishes your main strategy. If they simply had a couple leaders to choose from, like they do with pets, I think it would be fun to see what you could do, even if you were still offered a random selection to choose from.

Second problem: The difficulty curve ramps up as you enter the first boss fight, a near cliff face you have to scale with a meager deck of scraps. Each boss enemy has two fazes, yet also has numerous waves of enemies on the same timer as a normal battle, swamping you in priority targets, any of which will destroy you as you try to deal with them, or the boss. The battles that show up past this point are carefully crafted sets of synergies that are designed to show you just how pitiful the synergies you have access to truly are. Better hope you have the right type of deck to deal with each combat, or a linchpin card you guard with your life because it can deal with things you couldn't have predicted running into.

Positive 1: Each card feels like it should have a purpose and a place in your party, even if they are simply fodder to guard your leader in some way. There are many different status effects to wield and administer from poison and curses, to yellow bombs and shells. Each has a purpose, each has a strength, and each is used best by the enemy. Its hard to not frame this somewhat negatively, by pointing out how weak these feel when the player uses them, but they are fun to mess around with in the first stage of the game when you have a chance to do so.

Positive 2: Unlocks are a constant flow for the first few runs you have, before they slowly trickle away as your number of runs increase, but your viability remains the same. The pet system is great and offers a lot of choice in how you augment your usually pitiable leader into a decent force on the battlefield. The art is also ADORABLE, and helps in carrying this aspect. While some unlocks feel minimal, considering they mostly add to already rather extensive card pools, others you can feel the impact of, like the multiple factions. I look forward to seeing any other factions they add, as those add to the gameplay more than anything else you have a choice about!

I'm going to stop there for now. Its a great deck-building roguelike, marred by a difficulty that inflates itself by weakening the player's choices and agency and inflating the enemy's strength by providing numerous synergies and frustration-inducing effects that further limit player agency. I look forward to seeing what the team does to address the balance and difficulty concerns, and will update my review accordingly when they do so. I'm optimistic, so I'm starting it with a YES.",1.0

I paid full price for it and it was totally worth it.

Also if you are the developer reading this, I feel like there are a few charms that could be adjusted. the 3/3/3 charm is almost always negative, the bread charm always is a ""worse charm"" then almost anything else.... and the removing your charm limit is basically never relevant.  I'm not saying remove them, but it certainly is a ""feel bad"" moment when you get the fish charm before the first boss - because it isn't about to help you.

Pros
-Unique world setting (unlike foundation, settlement survival, and banished which are more medieval realism it's take a more fantasy oriented rout with magic""not available yet"" and heros ""limited gameplay"")
-The art style is eye-caching and stimulating and can be very beautiful
-Not the most hardcore survival city-builder, allowing time to plan relax and just have fun
-Build and overview UI wasn't confusing
-The relationship system it has with other neighbouring kingdoms is quirky and fun
-Every Seasons has effect to the overworld ( not just green for spring/summer/fall and white for winter)

Cons
-NPC AI is dumb (farms and resources gathering are full and no one brings them to the storehouse/granaries or to the homes. Once your city take up half the map people starve even when you have alot of food everywhere)
-Very early access (not alot to do past small city stage)
-Certain core resources are limited (like stone) after you run out that's it you cant build anymore
- NPC AI is REALLY DUMB, I know I said this before but it really breaks this game

However, game is kinda easy. If you have no experience with this type of games, play on Normal.
If you [b]ever played any X-COM/Xenonauts/Tactics game[/b], play on Hard and thank me later. 

[h2]Main con - Meta-Progression[/h2]
Wish there was more meta progression, right now you can unlock 2/3 of the unlocks in single game. And the rest requires you to actively play bad (like shoot your own team bad). Because unlocks are locked behind achievements. 
So past single run, game doesn't promote any rewards for playing actively well, with no meta-progression or anything. 
Wish that would change.

2181,136778859.0,1364020,"This is the reboot/clone of Shattered Horizon I've been dreaming of for many years, and I nearly wet myself when the trailers came out! Shattered Horizon was the 1st game I bought on Steam, back when they had that beautiful, clumsy single gun everyone had to use. It took real skill!

 But this game is just not playable for me right now. I have a X5900X CPU, Aorus X570 Master MB, a 2700 Super and 16 GB of ram. The game is installed on a Seagate FireCuda 530 M.2 SSD.  My network card is a 2.5 GB that performs better than my 1GB Intel card. Yet, I have to dial down some settings so the game will stop hitching every couple of seconds, even in the tutorials. The game crashes every minute or two even while going through the menu. Especially while in the keybinds menu! It would be nice if they let us add a comment to our crash reports. 

I thought it was my overclocking of my CPU, or possibly the GPU, so I turned off overclocking. It didn't make a difference. 
I read in the discussions that, being based on Unreal 4, performance issues can be caused by a bad connection, or even an under powered router. I've got the best connection, getting 0 to 50 ping max to several MP games I play. Heck, I believe PUBG is based on the Unreal 4 engine and I don't have these issues. So that seems like total non-sense to me. Maybe it isn't, but not in my case.

It also lacks an important sound option: Choosing your audio devices. I run several and channel stuff through each one. So that would be a really nice addition.

I'm probably going to have to wait a couple of months before this game becomes playable for me.  You've no idea how badly I wanted to be able to buy this game as soon as it came out. But it's just not done yet, so I can't currently recommend it to anyone. Shattered Horizon performed better in its beta stage! When things improve I will definitely recommend it though!",0.0

Gameplay is fun, with the few maps available providing a lot of variety due to varied bombsite placement and dynamic map layouts akin to R6Siege.

This is the first game I've tried on the Pico 4 so this might be due to the haptics of the controller, but the guns can feel a bit weak, not in terms of damage but in terms of gamefeel.

It could certainly do with more varied maps, modes and guns as we go along, but as is it's got everything you need to have fun for many hours, with no bugs to power through. Some things are a bit simplified, but seems to do so to provide a consistent experience. 
The IK system is really well done, with very lifelike movements replicated. It also features a lean system, that let's you use your playspace to lean your ingame body around corners etc. It's very well implemented and having tried it, it feels weird that this isn't a thing in all VR shooters.

- Interesting decisions to make.
- Fun card combos.
- Lots of unlockables.
- Great art and music.

Cons:
- Limited card options out of the gate.
- Takes a while to gain enough knowledge to mitigate the RNG.
- About 30% of your games will end early due to RNG putting you in an impossible situation right out of the gate.

Overall: It's a fun game that definitely scratches that Slay The Spire itch I have.

2213,136781403.0,1811990,"I admit the whole controversy about the difficulty just made me buy the game because I was interested in what of it was true. So here I am and 3,5 hourse later I got my first win after 7 or so attempts. That being said I am a veteran who play most deck builders since Slay the spire and have beaten Library of Ruina without mods. I get how many people could have difficulty beating this game. Some encounters are really hard and some are unbeatable if you dont have a counter in your deck. Knowing that counter in your first playthrough is impossible. 

But this isnt unfair. This is a roguelike with progression. Losing and learning are part of the game. Yes it is extremely difficult. Just like learning to swim is difficult. Your gonna dip your head underwater till you learn it. If you dont wnat that, stay out of the pool.

The game itself is fine, has extremely nice art and is quite different from other games of its kind. Turns are played in a way that you play cards, which either place units, companions and scrap items, on the field or have active effects. Each card you play is a turn that reduces the activation of every unit on the field. Those that hit 0 make their actions (attack, heal, whatever). 

With that you try to kill the enemy boss before your boss dies. Your boss is a unit on the field and you can pick one out of 3 at the start each run. Those have randomized HP, Attack, activation time and special effects. Companions can be recalled to be healed, but if they die they´re gone for the battle and have half HP and Attack for one fight after that. 

You also get charms which you can attach to cards. A lot of charms can be attached to units and active cards. So if a charm increases the number of activations that means your unit can attacks twice when it activates or an active card activates its effect twice and so on. You can attach up to three charms to a card which can lead to really silly and busted combos. And you NEED these. The later fights are unbeatable without at least one busted unit. And this is FUN. I love creating busted combos but in most games having these just means you breeze through the run. Here you need ot do this to have a chance. This means RNG is a large part in what you get. If you dont like that, then this isnt the game for you. If you like building the best of what you get with being force to use extremely different tactics each run, then this is the game for you. 

Spoiler for the end of a run:
There also seems to be a mechanic where the deck you win a run with gets possesed by the boss at the end? I dont know what that means yet, I assume you have to fight your own deck at some point. But since I dont have any more time today I cant tell you what that is about.",1.0
2214,136781243.0,1811990,"I love the game, it's been great fun. My only complaint so far is the lack of counterplay to teeth damage. Unless you have a ton of hp on all your units, or you have built a deck that can direct kill your 10+ hp of problems, teeth damage really don't have the same level of counterplay that all the other keywords have. You can't stop your hero from attacking, so when a unit generates with a random teeth charm on the front line the same turn your hero is ready to attack with their 1 hp, there's just nothing you can do. Which feels extremely punishing for ""bad luck"". 

Unlike most other abilities, neither ink nor frost will bail you out of that situation, and you cannot retreat your hero, so unless you have a self freeze or a kill spell to take out the spawned unit, there's just nothing you can do, which is really annoying.

2225,136782939.0,1364020,"If you're a fan of intense, high-stakes multiplayer shooters, then ""Boundary"" might just be the game for you. Developed by Surgical Scalpels, this tactical space-based shooter game offers a unique and exhilarating experience that's unlike anything else out there.

The game's zero-gravity mechanics are a standout feature, creating an entirely new way to approach combat and movement. Engage in fierce team vs team battles, executing low-gravity operations on orbiting space installations against enemy astroperators and other entities. The gameplay is fast-paced and intense, requiring quick reflexes and strategic thinking to come out on top.

Visually, ""Boundary"" is stunning. The graphics and visual effects are top-notch, making every firefight and zero-gravity maneuver feel immersive and realistic. The attention to detail in the environments and characters is also impressive, adding to the overall atmosphere of the game.

One thing that sets ""Boundary"" apart from other multiplayer shooters is its emphasis on teamwork. Communication and coordination are essential to success, and players who work together will have a definite advantage. This adds an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay, making for a more satisfying and rewarding experience.

Overall, ""Boundary"" is a great game that's well worth a try for fans of tactical shooters. With its unique zero-gravity mechanics, stunning visuals, and emphasis on teamwork, it's a game that's sure to keep you engaged and entertained for hours on end.",1.0

The second round in the game we ran into a bug when hiding in the mansion, I saw that the door was closed and my friend saw the door opened. When the door was closed at his viewpoint, the killer didn't come in and only growled outside. When the door was open at his viewpoint (for me door closed), the killer teleported inside the room and killed my friend at my viewpoint. Otherwise because no one was playing the game public, we didn't get the chance to team up with others to see what they make of it. 
Pros:
-Extremely horrifying, especially if you gaze into the old mansion with the flashlight on when the front door is open. the killer will chase you  from an angle. The doubleface-kids and skeleton props are also bloody and designed well.
-Gives the option to mute scream. Most times I don't get scared at the killer's face but the screams I make.
Cons:
-With the flashlight on, the visible range is too narrow. Realistic to see only a short distance, but only having a cylinder range in the middle of the screen, with total black on both sides creates a sense of being trapped in a bad way. I had to constantly turn my head up, down, left and right to look for stuff, which made me feel irritated and gradually dizzy in two hours.

2247,136785379.0,1811990,"WIldfrost is a new take on a well-trod genre, that of the deckbuilding roguelike.

With an appealing artistic direction, you lead a group of companions through the snowy landscape while facing an array of challenging bosses. At its core, each run is about both creating a strong deck and making tight tactical decision during a variety of combats. Your deck must be one that straddles the line of both having a synergistic means of scaling against increasingly tough threats while also having the versatility to deal with many different threats, which proves an engaging challenge. This is akin to similar games such as Slay the Spire, but the margin for error here is tighter, which is likely the cause for many of the negative reviews. Secondly, each encounter requires maneuvering your units around enemies that are on discrete timers, reminiscent of Through the Breach. 

In testing both dimensions, Wildfrost creates an experience that is greater than the sum of its parts. With some added quality of life features and some balancing (note, the issue here is more about the perception of balance than any actual balance), Wildfrost will become one of the top roguelike deckbuilders if it is not already.

Strong recommend

Edit: Upon looking at the other reviews, at present (April 16, 2023), the English language reviews are 85% positive while all reviews are at ~65% positive, meaning that non-English reviews are less than 50% positive. I'd suspect that there's some issue with how the mechanics are depicted in non-English languages (it seems many of the negative reviews are in Mandarin).",1.0
2248,136785265.0,1811990,"Charming game. The main draw is probably the aesthetics, though the card battling itself is fairly mechanically unique, which is pretty necessary when the 'indie card rogue-lite' genre is currently so over-saturated. It's currently being review bombed for it's atypically harsh difficulty, which isn't at the level where it's worth being called 'unbalanced' or considered an objective flaw, but the game also isn't exactly marketed as the 'dark souls of card games' or anything, so many players seem to have been blindsided. 

If you aren't afraid of having to put in effort to succeed, or of sometimes losing a run despite your best efforts, these negative reviews shouldn't dissuade you. The game is, in my experience, entirely free of the issues that would otherwise justify a negative review- no performance issues, all the systems function as intended, and the concept of the game is solid.
I would like to see a little more player control over the deck they assemble though. Especially the starting deck. I know this is somewhat antithetical to the genre (the rng is part of being a rogue-like), but setting out with the intention of building a deck around the 'shroom' mechanic, and then completing the run having never been given the option to take even one card related to 'shrooms' can be frustrating in an entirely different way than difficulty. You can already choose your leader and pet at the start of the run, except not really because the available leaders are three randomly generated options, and sometimes they'll all be bad, or just not what you want for your run, and there is no re-roll or quick-restart. This sort of complaint is easily remedied though- just a re-roll button, or 'build your own leader' option, and perhaps a few more systems that unlock more player choice as they progress (like the pets).",1.0

City Builder players who want a fun and relaxing casual experience. If you are looking to try this genre out for the first time, this is the perfect game for you as the entry barrier to learn the game isn't high. The game has a unique characteristic thanks to the art style, the narrator, and a few cute surprises you'll encounter along the way.

[b]How is the game's performance?[/b] 
Gameplay's smooth. It's not a game that requires 144 FPS, and isn't here to eat a lot of your computer's resources. No crashes ever since the game's release apart from the small texture issues. However, there's currently an issue with the game using 100% of your GPU. It's not an issue for everyone though.

[b]What are the devs like?[/b]
Like this game, the people behind it have the same characteristics. It's a pretty small team and they're vocal about the changes they want  to put in that are based out of data they gathered. 

[b]Would you recommend this game?[/b] 
Yes, specifically for the people who think they want something chill, casual, and fun to play especially if they need something in between their hardcore games. I've enjoyed the city building aspect so much.

Not yet for people who want tons of content.",1.0

The greatest parts I could not believe were that the majority of the games' region exclusivity differences, for example, in Battle Network 3, each version it's own differences and both also had an exclusive 'Navi Customizer' boot up screen, which used to be a Japanese exclusive ""cut-scene"". 
Overall, the first 3 games in the series are the more tedious and story-line driven games with similarities between them all. A very interesting start to the series but definitely not a bad entry to the Collection.

Additionally, it is inconvenient that the playing guitar button and head machine buttons are too far apart from each other when tuning.
Also, there is a bug where the character keeps moving if you press the W and A keys simultaneously and then release them.

2277,136784731.0,1934520,"I randomly came across this game, and as a massive fan of roguelikes and, more recently, survivor-likes, I found this one to look interesting. It was on sale, but the negative reviews warned of a horrific sounding mechanic where if too many enemies were on the map, your run just ends. Sounds counter-intuitive to this type of game. There was an update just recently where this mechanic was changed from outright killing you to immensely debuffing you instead. I decided to take the plunge with a 20% discount and try my luck.

I did not enjoy it. I couldn't get past the first boss, the first level, nothing. I'm not saying it's all the game's fault, but I found many frustrating, anti-gaming mechanics thrown in here that made little sense beyond packing the game in with frustration. You start off with a very slow firing, low damage bow that fires automatically. You'll get swarmed pretty quickly in this game. The balance of ramping up the amount of enemies versus your own power is very tipped towards the enemy. I found myself hitting the limits of this baffling horde mechanic in no time. Had I played the patch previous, I wouldn't have made it past the first minute in any run. Even with the change, this horde mechanic still helps stack the deck very much against you. I didn't see a reliable way of powering yourself up. The chests are random and may not give you what you need, the ""Sister Statues"" will only buff you if you take a debuff first or will add to the enemy count/decrease your max HP/other penelty if you don't take the blessing, and the first ""boss"" I encountered was a slime enemy that messes with your movement big time by causing the ground to be slippy and force you into obstacles and enemies against your will. It is abnormally easy to be surrounded and trapped against an obstacle, causing a quick and frustrating death. This all coalesces into a gaming experience that is not fun, at least in my eyes. 

Part of the charm of the survivor-like, at least for me, is the power ramp of your character. A bit of a peak of difficulty is expected, but only in line with your own power increase. Every mechanic in this game seems designed to build the difficulty wall and force you to scale it with almost no increase to your own power. It is supremely unfun. 

My last run, which was my best attempt at it, is what decided I was going to refund this. I was slipping around because of the slime boss, not having any real way to even get to it because there were so many enemies on the screen blocking it. These are enemies that will push you around, drain your health quickly, and all of that is multiplied due to the horde mechanic which will almost always be maxed out. I definitely tried seeking out chests, forges, sister statues for blessings (even if they hampered me further). I activated a statue which would give me a random blessing, but the trade off is that I had the slime debuff, on me (which I already had permanently because the slime boss was still alive) until I found a corresponding statue which was marked. I just decided to run there because any help I can get against this ridiculous tide of enemies that I had no real chance against I would take. But, for whatever reason, the framerate started plummeting. I somehow ended up at literally single digit frames where it would skip to a future frame maybe once every few seconds. I was able to pause and navigate the menu okay, but any graphical changes I would make did not help whatsoever (potentially not helped by the simple graphical options I had). My guess was that the mixture of amount of enemies densely pooled together caused the game to deteriorate. For reference, my computer has Intel i9-9900K processor, NVIDIA RTX 2070 Super, and 32 GB of RAM. I should not be experiencing such a thing.

So, the above has caused me to initiate a refund and share my negative experience. It is a shame, because I really like these types of games.",0.0

2283,136716571.0,1798020,"Okay, listen, I've been playing the Battle Network games for a little over a decade now, and I thought I'd basically experienced the peak version of Battle Network 5 with the Nintendo DS release, known as Double Team DS. I have my copies of BN3, 4, 5, and 6 on GBA as well, and even got the Bass icon on my BN5 save file so I could access Bass Cross on the DS version AND send over whatever the heck kind of folder I wanted to build from the GBA version of 5 to the DS one.

Let me tell you that all of that does not even compare to how shwacked the mod cards are for BN5 alone. Holy moly, I loaded up FireMan's card immediately because I love that guy and I get a Fire Arm Charge Shot AND a Heat Elemental affinity, complete with a new super rad color scheme to boot. I usually don't bother to get the Black Bomb R from the Purple Mystery Data in ACDC 2 until I've at least got the Hot Body chips at my disposal, but with the Fire Arm charge shot, I made that the first thing I beelined for in this new save file. It is BUSTED this early on AND there's a mod card section for items. Guess what's among them? BLACK BOMB Z. I have two, fucking TWO Black Bombs in my folder and I haven't even put ProtoMan in his place yet.

This is the most cathartic run of Battle Network 5 I've ever done and I have so many different ways I can now modify my play style. I loaded up a card with the Status Bug for a free 50/50 shot at either a temporary buff or debuff, which is normally something I have to bug my Navi Cust for with more than four colors, but now I just have that! I had experience with Mega Man Zero 3's mod cards before thanks to the Zero Collection on DS and the Zero/ZX Legacy Collection, but those pale in comparison to what's offered for the Battle Network games. Oh my god. I'm already making plans for my next Dark Soul playthrough of Team Colonel after I finish my current playthrough of Team ProtoMan.

Good lord, this is a whole new way to play some of my favorite RPGs of all time. I've already been juggling these games for roughly a year now on my DS, as the combat's so consistently satisfying to me that it never gets old or leads to burnout, but this pair of collections has reignited my passion for experimenting with loads of different folders and strategies. I haven't felt this close to combat nirvana since the first time I used the different Mod Codes in Battle Network 3's Navi Customizer all those years ago. KTEIUE2D, the Super Armor code, still remains embedded in my mind and I'm convinced it will remain there until the day I die.

So yeah, the collections fucking own. Play Battle Network 2, 3, or 6 as a starting point and go from there. 1 and 4 are super rough and I'd recommend at least having a foothold in the series before attempting them. 5's probably the hardest one, so while I love it to death, I can see it being a bit much for newcomers at first. Still damn good though. Absolutely give 5 a shot. God, I love Battle Network so much. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Wildfrost is a deep and engaging game that a lot of players seem to be approaching the wrong way.

[b] Forget everything you've come to expect from other Deck Buillders [/b]

Wildfrost leans heavy into the [i] Rogue Like [/i] side of things. Instead of building and perfecting a deck, you get a new hero every run that sort of decides what your build and run is going to end up as. Some heroes maybe  even end up being duds who end your run early, while others will end up synergising an insane deck that completely wrecks your opponents. Depending on which faction you pic, you do get access to cards and support heroes that are constant. As you play, you may get a random hero and immediately know which support cards will go with that particular hero and what you should look out for. And there's a lot to look out for. 

For one thing the game has a number system that counts down on individual cards and when the number reaches zero, those cards carry out their moves. So keeping watch on enemy cards and delaying cards as needed through mechanisms is important. You also need to watch for buffs and debuffs on both your team and the enemy team, and you gotta make sure you sub-out team mates to heal them! In fact, there's a lot going on at any given moment and you really have to play around a bit to pick up on all the games nuances. 

I'm surprised there are so many players calling Wilfrost unbalanced, when they have such little play time. And players saying that the game is ""too hard"" and ""unfair"" just because they can't kill a boss or two on the first try. Really dude?

This game rewards your time investment. There are unlocks, that help make the runs a little less RNG dependent and there are mechanics to learn that level you up as a player. A sort of meta progression if you will. 

I absolutely love Wildfrost. The art and presentation is stunning, the characters are so well designed and show off so much character for mostly static images and the game as a whole has a charm that makes me want to stay with it. I think it deserves way more than praise than it's getting. (Critically, the game is getting love online, but I think it deserves way more love on Steam)

I highly recommend Wildfrost, but I implore you to go into it with patience and an open mind.

[i] And devs, I'm all for you guys making tweaks as you feel fit, but please don't dumb down the difficulty or the core mechanics/ vision that you have for Wildfrost. There's a game on here called Souldiers, that a lot of players called out for being too difficult, so the devs for that game caved in and tweaked the difficulty to make it easier. This alienated the players that were actually enjoying the difficulty and now the game sits in Review-limbo. [/i]",1.0

2300,136717668.0,1811990,"The game is good, now on to the problems with it. 

- People complain that this game is like filing taxes. One wrong move and your entire life comes crumbling down, and half of the time you don't even know what you're doing. I consider this more of a skill issue since you guys do know you can move the position of your dudes every single turn right? There is no time limit, so you can adjust your dudes optimally. This is clearly designed to be a brutal game for some of the more hardcore roguelike fans. Also, for those of you who are confused with attack order, it starts from the front top, then the turn order moved down. It never goes sideways, unlike my life. 

- The deck can easily be bloated just like your mom. It's a known fact that having a smaller deck would make it more consistent, so this can be a problem. There is only one way to get rid of cards (through the Muncher) and you can only do that two at a time. I recommend allowing us to remove one card when in the shop for a fee. In the meantime, if you are not interested in adding new cards to your deck, I recommend going to charms whenever you have the chance. Another pro tip in the late game, you can pick frozen travelers and put them in reserve permanently. Who knows, maybe they might be better than what you currently have, or you can laugh at their face.

- The card pool is too polluted, just like the waters in Africa. There are a lot of cards, and I'm fairly sure half of them aren't tied to whatever faction you are at. Yet you only get 3 choices out of probably a couple of hundred in the pool, and some of them aren't even meant for synergizing (such as the one where it gives 4 gold after every kill, I mostly just use that as a blocking dummy if I had no real good choice). I do agree that it can be frustrating when you don't get the cards that help with your build. I propose that we should pick from a pool of 4 or 5, allow us to pay money to reroll, or maybe both if you're feeling merciful and lost your mind from all of these negative reviews. 

- The final boss. It's easy until it's not. Everyone who got there understands exactly what I mean. I personally wish to opt out of it and be severely punished for it someway somehow because I'm at a massive standstill right now. I wish I could build a deck that could counter it, but because of the previous problems I explained, the game relies a lot on luck to see if I pulled what I needed. In short, I have to be really lucky and find the synergy or I'm not... and trust me I'm not by default. 

In short, I hate myself in the best possible way. This game makes me feel pain in ways that I myself enjoy, but can't (and won't) explain to everyone else. That being said, I want all of my deaths to be my fault, and I don't want any outside forces that I can use as an excuse. I'm pretty sure everyone else feels like this in a way. 10/10

P.S: Why do people keep complaining about the cats when the hogs have annihilated me 12 out of 13 times. I counted.",1.0
2301,136789211.0,1922010,"[b]Summary:[/b]
It's simple, it's fun, but it's lacking in content.

Players mileage will vary depending on how much they like the competitive nature, local community and general game play. Personally I've gotten my money's worth during this and the beta play time. Encounters can become stale and samey after a while, with preset destructible locations leads players/traps to becoming kind of predictable.

[b]Visuals:[/b]
- Visuals are nothing to write home about, they're fine and suit the intended purpose. A lot of complaints about it, but nothing objectively terrible - just a whole lot of unrealistic entitled opinions. Personally, I appreciate being able to maintain a steady FPS on 120hz.  
- Clipping plane may need to be lowered for higher FOV headsets it seems, it's exploitable on the index and according to another comment may be worse on the Pimax.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]

- Movement is unrestrained and responsive to inputs unlike Pavlov with it's speed ramp/playspace movement kill system. It's simple, but it's fun.  
- Aiming feels smooth and doesn't lead to feeling outclassed by v-stock users, though have heard one player comment that they feel like controllers are being smoothed out too much tracking wise - but I haven't found issue with it. 
- The lean mechanic is under-appreciated by players, but is really neat piece of game design. Sometimes feels like a minor de-sync from player hit box though, in one extreme case a player put down their headset and visual mesh was completely disconnected from hit box location by about 2 meters. 
- Weapon mechanics (active reload) are non-existent for balancing purposes, but it kind of feels like a cop out - the frustration from waiting for an arbitrary cool down period to fire your gun after reload kind of sucks.
- Bullet penetration. It exists between players, but there's times that feel like you're registering limb damage instead of head/head. Unsure, but it was an concern that players block head shots due to hands in front of head.
- Balance wise there's many guns that feel lacking a purpose. The Auril & Urakan in particular stands out, Canutt is incredibly unreliable and Viper/RCB may need adjustment.
- Factory is the best map out of the three competitive maps visually and mechanically it just feels balanced design wise - perfect amount of long distance -> medium/short range encounters with each bomb site feels distinct.
Compared to hideout which feels almost too busy and bland with it's small rooms and winding corridors. Skyscraper, mixed thoughts - one pair of bombsites needs more accessibility for attackers imo.

[b]Sound:[/b]
- Sound is incredibly important in this game, a lot of players don't either have it up loud enough or lack game sense to distinguish friend from foe.
- Seems to be inconsistent across players, unsure why or if true but it's leading to a lot of frustration. My sound on 100% index, I can hear footsteps just fine. 
- Directionality needs work though. It's impossible to distinguish between up and down floors without relying on map knowledge for material sounds. 
- Spectators are able to heard sound anywhere on the map, which gives the dead players something to do - help track alive enemies and report positions to friendlies which is usually accurate to about a 4m radius. 
Which is fun for me and gives a purpose to dead team mates but feels like it needs to or will be removed. 
It brings on a lot of comments with people feeling like players have wall hacks, but that's more an issue with unskilled/uncoordinated pub matches. Ideally would like it to stay, but can see why it would go.  

[b]Wishlist:[/b]
- [u]Kill trade system/reduced bullet deletion[/u] - There's too many encounters where both players may land shots but one will register faster then the other leading to their shot being deleted. The problem with this is that blood effects play before the player loses control and dies, leading to frustrated players that know they have made the shot, know they saw blood
and accounting for weapon damage knows that should be an instant kill. This would also help cross regional play. From my experience it's frustrating enough with a 50 ping difference against equally skilled players. 
- [u]Player model clipping[/u] - Low priority but there's a lot of thin surfaces that players are resting against their model will clip through leading to them getting shot in the back through a wall. 
- [u]Ping markers[/u] on broken walls need to be fixed, allows spectators to identify what's been breached despite no visibility.
- [u]Bots[/u] get stuck at doors was a big issue before in the beta, seems like it may still be an issue. In general, they're super frustrating at times, aim locking you through walls and corners. 1 tap head shots at great distances, to not being able to kill a player within a meter. 
- [u]Toggle Grip - Vive Wands[/u] are vastly under-appreciated. For someone with re-occuring wrist problems, they're most comfortable controller for me to use. Having a hold to grip system makes them a no go. For comparison, I can't use a quest 2 or reverb G2 controller without major pain. Along with the reliability and input response make them preferable to knuckles. This issue is stopping users from purchasing the game and was requested back in beta to no avail.
- [u]Player moderation[/u] - It's understandable that devs wish to prevent player abuse, but not allowing players to moderate themselves in their local communities is frankly silly. 
This has lead to a lot of instances of player trolling with ping spam/flash bangs/FF/noise/camping, with no way to kick afk or people abusing glitches/bugs, or simply being abusive.
Having to record footage on the players end for ban reports on the discord, or using the in game system surely leads to an increase on dev time on mundane matters, no? - when players could simply kick and move on with their day.
- [b][u]Ping needs a separate audio control in options[/u][/b] - It's incredibly triggering and distracting. You can mute players to stop this, but if they're unconnected to the VC then they're free to spam. But alternatively you may want to chat with them just not hear the ping sound. They're frankly abrasive, a cool down wouldn't hurt either but mostly just want a mute.
- [u]Grenades[/u] feel like they need a better radial damage system. There are times players are within 1 meter but receive no damage, one instance of a player standing directly on top of the nade survived. Mostly just if it roles underneath some small gap, table or trolley it won't hurt an adjacent player. In particular ballistic room on Factory.
- [u]Local match recording/playback system[/u] - It feels like it may be scope creep at this point in time when more content is needed but there's too many times people call bullshit hacks. Post-game this would at least allow a player to re-wind and examine their mistakes.",1.0

2303,136715956.0,1772830,"I have not completed Rusted Moss yet, but I plan on getting further into it. So far, I am enjoying it but I do have some criticisms to lay out. 

What I enjoy about the game is the fast-paced action where you have to be careful how you proceed or the enemies will make quick work of you. The areas are very different from each other, and the accompanying music matches well which can be challenging for some games to do. As someone who loves an engaging plot with character development, I didn't find much of that here as the story was more in the background and not interesting enough to focus on. 

Where Rusted Moss lacks the most is in its controls and grappling hook ability. It's fun to be able to swing around and get to places quickly, as I could see professional speed runners putting their skills to the test here. The problem is if you aren't used to the feature it can be difficult to get through some areas. 

I often spent more time in one section trying to swing past some spikes than getting through the stage. It made the game less enjoyable and at times I wanted just to quit and do something else, like write this review to not get tired of being impaled.

I would give Rusted Moss a chance if you have not played it as it is fun, but the difficulty certainly should be modified which I would find hard to pull off since the level design would have to be changed. It's a game that succeeds in making a pixelated platformer that tries to be a Metroidvania, but gets stuck in its own mechanics like the grappling.",1.0

The grappling hook functions like elastic and these spaces play around a lot with the physics, but many ask for some hyper precise movement that is difficult to nail down consistently with how inherently chaotic such freeform mobility can be, there is little room for error in this basic traversal ultimately making it feel like a frustrating test of patience. I spent large chunks of time within singular rooms wrestling with the grapple trying to get it to behave just the way I needed it to in order to progress, sitting on the edge of my seat trying not to die and be sent rooms and rooms back to the checkpoint, which is not something I've ever experienced in a physics based platformer before. The pacing of upgrades is also incredibly odd, within the first thirty to forty-five minutes I picked up the basic grappling hook and a high jump, and those were the only movement upgrades I had received up until my final half hour. Everything in-between was either a passive effect or a weapon I could only find a niche use for. It was very refreshing to see a new mechanic and potentially loosen up some of the tighter platforming areas, but it was immediately made irrelevant by the next area where I was in zero gravity and at the whims of hazards that are made to force the player in different directions. I really wanted to like Rusted Moss, but I felt like I never got a good handle on the controls or stopped fighting with the game, and my aggravation led me to dropping it close to the finish line.

Good game.

Strong gun play, important mobility, interesting tactics.

Probably won't give too real a review until the game's actually in full release since it's been a WIP for a while now, and it's still a WIP. 

I recommend it, if only so I can have more folk to play with.",1.0
2338,136789872.0,1364020,"First and foremost I really really wanted to like this game. It has a very cool premise and the map design is super neat. Being able to move in every direction is something that not a lot of shooters do and it really adds a bit of complexity to finding enemies. Being able to see enemies moving the distance and around cover based on their thrusters is something you will have to learn and control as you try to sneak around or reposition around the battlefield. Cosmetics were neat but seem unfinished as their is a currency in the game but nothing to spend it on. The best part of the game is the fact that you can grab any weapon and go into a range to test it out quickly. Unfortunately that is where the good ends.

Guns and Classes are super unbalanced. The tank class offers no more survivability than other classes with the added negative of being the slowest class with the worst weapons. All the other classes play pretty much the same with the only real differences being the mobility items which either stop you in your tracks or give you a lot of speed, or the weapons which only makes a difference if you can't get a hold of the DMR or TK47 as those are far and wide the best guns in the game right now.

TTK and connection are inconsistent as there are only 3 servers currently and the game mashes everyone from the US, Europe, and Asia into the same servers constantly. I was constantly killed by people that had not appeared on my screen or in only 2-3 rounds after I had dumped 8-9 shots into them only getting hit markers, and that's if my bullets didn't simply pass through them. 

New players will be highly disadvantaged to the game as more people unlock better weapons and attachments as the lower tier attachments almost hinder your gameplay more than help. Sights are clunky and take up too much of your vision or are just plain unhelpful against the inky darkness of space. This serves to only push new players out of the game when they get repeatedly crushed by opponents that have access to better options that new players will have trouble unlocking because everything requires kills to unlock. 

Menus are good to look at but unhelpful and clunky. Selecting equipment shows no description of what it does beyond a few basic stats. Frequently guns would lose attachments between games and have to be re-edited after the match. Some attachments offer 0 upside while actively harming the guns stats. The path to unlocking attachments is long and take a lot of grinding against opponents that will be more deadly as the game goes on with little recourse to level the playing field other than picking the assault class and grinding out the TK47.

Respawn systems are also a weakpoint of the game as I was constantly trapped in a 2-3 spawn point cycle of getting gunned down by people sitting just outside of our spawn shooting us before our character would ready their weapon. 

Overall the game could use a lot of balancing changes to the weapons/classes to make them actually feel unique and balanced. Cluttering up some spaces so that snipers are not dominant and able to shoot from one spawn to the other. Progression system rebalancing so that new players are not locked out of weapon attachments for quite as long. Lastly better match making so that players can choose which server they would like to play on instead of getting pushed to a server that is far away and having massive ping in the process.",0.0
2339,136655883.0,1567000,"There have been a lot of retro-style shooters released in recent years. A lot of them have been disappointing or flatly bad. I've played many of them.

Even though I haven't played illWill for very long, I can confidently say that it's one of the BEST retro-style shooters to be released since the ""renaissance"" for this type of game started. The guns feel great to use. The enemy variety is really solid even just part of the way into the second level. The level design quality seems high without being overly complex. Looking at the screenshots and trailers there seems to be impressive variety in the design and aesthetics of the levels, and already the second level is much different from the first (this contrasts with a lot of old-school shooters that have overly similar levels). I'm also happy with how quickly the difficulty has increased in illWill. I've only tried ""Normal"" difficulty so far, but on this setting it's harder than plenty of retro-style shooters on ""Hard."" Finally, the game runs perfectly--there don't seem to be any performance or other significant technical problems, it's very smooth.

I just hope there's a good amount of content here, because so far, it seems unlikely that anything could be seriously wrong with this game unless it ends up being too short.

Btw I recommend turning on ""Infinite corpses"" in the options menu as long as it doesn't result in any technical problems.

Bottom line: This seems like a fantastic game. If you like retro-style shooters, BUY THIS. Hopefully some big reviewers will bring attention to illWill so that it enjoys the success it deserves.",1.0

Frogwares Sherlock Holmes series has been very hit or miss for me, with the previous title, Chapter One, being a miss in my opinion. The older version of Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened also didn't do it for me. I loved the story, but the game was too janky for me to truly enjoy it. Luckily then, that this remake delivers that same excellent story, expanded upon it, and delivers it with an entertaining gameplay loop for those who enjoy more narrative-driven puzzle adventure games.
Admittedly, the game is fairly easy and straight-forward. It didn't challenge my deductive reasoning skills as much as Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments did (in my opinion still the best Frogwares Sherlock Holmes game). It's also fairly linear, and the path forward is usually not difficult to figure out. But while the game is easy, it provides just enough of a challenge to never be boring.
The best part of this game is its narrative and presentation. This game oozes atmosphere, and the story is a compelling one. It often expands and improves on the narrative of the old The Awakened game, and even for people who played that version, this game's story will have some interesting surprises in store. Truly, it's one of the best Sherlock Holmes stories to date, and that is including the movies, TV series, and novels. But of course this game isn't just about Sherlock, it's also about the Cthulhu Mythos, and it doesn't disappoint in that area either. If you're looking for a great Lovecraftian story, this game has what you're looking for.

2349,136710627.0,1811990,"The game is fantastic, I sunk many hours in since purchase. It shows how fun it is. The game is straightforward with it's mechanics, and the cards are explained really well. There are 3 full unique factions that are easily unlockable right now. The art style and music are wonderful and add to the experience. The charms are my favorite part of the game, they add great synergies and give you the ability to craft unique cards!

Game is challenging enough to feel rewarding to win. And the progression of the game is exciting. Getting to fight against your own squad to win is ridiculous, hilarious, and can be a fun challenge.

Things that could be improved are adding even more variety. If you enjoy the game a lot at the release, some things can get a bit repetitive. But it's understandable at it's current state of the game. Also, I don't really like the pet mechanic (you get a first companion of your choice), because companion choices are very limited. I wish the first companion was also randomized after you choose your leader. Lastly, would be great to see 3 leaders of each faction as a choice. Because once you unlock all the factions, you get a randomized leader per faction, which can be limiting if you really enjoy playing only one of them. I felt much better about it before I unlocked factions, because I could choose 3 different leaders from starting faction. Other than that, it's a great game that I really recommend, and I hope it will only get better. 

This is my first review of the game ever. I can't help but notice lots of negative reviews. I think people forget how challenging roguelites can be. I do see the frustration element where one positioning mistake could quickly end your run. However, currently, I find the game well-balanced, and full of opportunities to explore broken synergies with companions, cards, and charms.",1.0
2350,136710890.0,1949030,"A better Lovecraftian tale than most.

[i]The Awakened[/i] tackles the collision between rationality and the irrational, and pits the man of deduction and reason against those things that destroy you when you come to know them. It's a great blueprint for a story, but the execution of such a high concept is difficult for even the best storytellers. Focusing in on this angle, on Sherlock Holmes' descent into madness as he tries to unravel his first big case alongside Watson, is the strongpoint of this remake; I haven't played the original but I feel like it wasn't an element there. The characters are endearing and the performances strong enough to sell their relationship - another improvement, as I understand - over the older series of games.

It's clear that Frogwares have evolved their craft, both that of telling Lovecraftian stories and of making Holmes games. With this one, they understand that they key to selling cosmic horror is not to portray it directly (as they did in the ambitious, but flawed [i]Sinking City[/i] - a game I rather loved, for all its faults). The key is to dance around the edges, revealing the minimal amount possible, skirting the line between mundane human cruelty and supernatural evil, until the characters (and hopefully the audience) start jumping at shadows. Holmes [i]can't[/i] be allowed to be certain either way if he's sane or mad, and the narrative sustains that ambiguity well.

The problems, I'd say, are the same ones Frogwares always has. The standardized investigation gameplay yields to easily to brute-force play, and the concept of the game deserved a grander budget and more time. It feels, at least, like the game could have benefited from a few more connective scenes here and there, an earlier setup for the final villain and more polished presentation of certain gameplay elements (like the shooting segments), so that it feels more natural and less on-rails. However, given that this game was made in the middle of a warzone, it's a stunning accomplishment as it stands.

I think the madness sections deserve special consideration. Narratively, they're great breaks in the game's pacing and are very good at setting up a sinister, unnerving atmosphere. I also love their game design. Very clearly they function with rules so violent and obscure that they might as well be madness (even though they *are* rules). That's a pretty elegant representation of the kind of stuff Lovecraft was talking about. They were really good sections and I only wish they had been better spread throughout the game. Maybe shorter, and added in a few more spots.

In the future I would like to see more involved and complicated deduction mechanics and better setup and characterization for supporting characters. Making the many outfits in the game actually relevant to the gameplay (as they were in [i]Chapter One[/i]) would also be nice. And, also, Frogwares, *please* go through one of these games without referencing Moriarty. We get it. He's out there. He even has an anime now. Stop trying to make him into an Marvel arch-villain.

I was very happy to support and play this game. I may have been critical in my review but it's still Frogwares at their finest. I look forward to seeing what other games they make when this war is over.

The game itself has its moments where it can be super fun but then once you play enough youll started getting into ""sweat"" lobbies...players who have the most OP operators completely leveled up and skills trees grandfathered in from the old MTX p2w system. But they recently change their whole MTX system so thats cool. 

If you're a new player, your best bet is to look for guides on some OP operators to compete with in game.

Operators can cost anywhere from 100k to 200k, of course the good/most picked operators being 200k. So be sure to do your research on how good that operator is. 

In order to play ranked you need 3 Operators OF THE SAME CLASS, meaning you need 3 assaults or 3 snipers, etc. That alone will cost you half a million coins, a little more-or-less depending on the Ops. After you get those 3 operators you need to level those operators, a level 15 operators will cost you 156,000 credits along with experience points, which is basically another currency. Once you do that 3 times youll be able to play that ONE role in ranked. 

Oh WAIT I forgot Skills...

Each operator can have 4 passive skills to help them perform better. Now...how do you get those skills? EACH operator in the game gives you one of those skills...after you level that operator up. Thats another 200,000 Minimum.

SO this means if you want some skills that are considered good, you will need to buy the corresponding operator and level that operator up to unlock that skill he gives. So if a skill you want is on an operator that really isnt good, you still have to level that operator to get the skill to put on your main operators. 

I ran some numbers, for 4 skills that are considered competitive, it will cost you roughly 650,000 credits. 

Another issue I have is with the Battlepass...

This game introduces some VERY strong operators behind a paywall, which is why people say its P2W. It is a VERY VALID point people make. In order to get access to the newer ops you NEED to buy the battlepass, if you chose not to, then that operator will not be available for that season AND THE NEXT SEASON. That's TWO whole seasons in which the OP operators will be unavailable to non paying players.

However, the game almost feels like a puzzle in that sense, you are attempting to figure out how to tackle the weaknesses in your deck, 'Should you cycle your companion, or wait for just oooonee more hit?', 'Should you put the Play it for Free charm on a an item and be able to increase your coverage or on a companion and allow you to cycle their health faster?', '[spoiler] Should I buff my companions/hero with a charm, knowing that if this run is successful the shade will possess them, or should I put it on an item and hope that I cycle into it enough during combat to keep my squishes? [/spoiler]'. These are the kind of decisions I stick around for and enjoy.

The main issue I had with the game is once you've unlocked everything (excluding all the achievement charms as I haven't gotten there), it doesn't feel like there's tooooo much there and some charms are so specific that having gone out of your way to get a charm or buying them for 50 feels like a punishment. Hopefully, in the future, there will be a content patch to add more stuff and probably tweak the balance as the community has been saying.

2423,136683935.0,1183800,"TLDR: An excellent roguelike featuring turn-based tactical combat in the style of XCOM that mixes in elements from Darkest Dungeon (Eg. Camping Skills). I would recommend Shardpunk: Verminfall to anyone that enjoys or is looking to get into this particular genre of games - especially at this price point. 

Having just finished my first successful run on normal, which I binged over the course of 9 hours, I have to say that it's quite the compact yet fairly polished experience. The core combat loop is extremely enjoyable and is fairly similar to XCOM in this regards, where good positioning and target priority is highly rewarded. This is complimented by an excellent soundscape and a banger OST, which creates a wonderful atmosphere of perpetual tension — which really comes to forefront in the lulls between combat encounters. 

The game, much to my surprise, also has an excellent tutorial stage. To someone who is new to the genre, it does a good job of bringing the player up to speed on the key game systems and guiding them on how they actually work in practice by introducing important complexities - such as how Weapon Heat interacts with Overwatch. As such, the tutorial is quite useful for veterans of the genre as well, as it clearly explains and demonstrates mechanics which either iterate on the X-COM formula or a simply brand new (Ohhh Looting Spree my beloved)

Whilst I could go on at length about how I enjoyed all these iterations/additions to the X-COM formula, the sheer excitement and/or panic that I experienced when I interacted with them for the first-time is something I highly recommend that you experience yourself.

That being said, I really like CK so I knew he could make a decent game and that was enough to convince me to spend the money to give the game a chance.

1) Technically the game is fine with the notable exception of the sex scene that wasn't because when I clicked on Yes for manual control, it went by so quickly (and I don't mean the scene was short. I mean it was like somebody hit fast forward and the pages zipped by) that it was basically over before it started. A bit like losing your virginity. 

2) The graphics are fine. Nothing much to say one way or the other. 

3) The writing. This game tries to be serious and funny and doesn't succeed at either one. The MC is whiny and inept, but can suddenly transform into super smooth once you figure out the secret formula (and you will because it's a trope, and a bad one at that).  Your friends seem to exist for no reason other than to further highlight said ineptitude. Most AVNs, or at least the ones I've played, are mindless lighthearted sex romps. Some actually have a little bit of a plot that works in between sex scenes. Some have the potential for a good plot depending on how it develops. Unscripted is none of these.

My only problem compared to monster train is runs feel a lot shorter and you dont get as many upgrades. Which doesnt feel as fun to make a powerful deck.

Great things the game does:

When you beat the game your team that beat the game becomes the new end boss for the next run. Amazing because you have to plan your new run on countering your old broken team. Very strategic.

Random starting hero card. So cool rolling the dice and getting a new hero every time.

Bad stuff is RNG can end runs early because you die on like the first boss. Even many runs in this still sometimes happens for me. 

Some enemies are too strong, I hope to get some easy encounters and dread getting others. And a bug for developers to fix, rng ended a run just now where an enemy card had a teeth modifier charm, but the text didnt show up on the card because it already had a full card of text.

All my guys attacked the teeth charm card and died, and I obviously wasnt given a warning in text only the small little charm in the bottom left. Text needs to be scaleable so if it runs off the card it will just put the front smaller to show up on the card.

I will agree with some of the other reviewers on the biggest thing wrong with this game is the balance. There are some archetypes that just aren't viable and that hurts the replayability because it feels like you either build the same couple runs or lose. However, that will come with time.

2506,136682386.0,1798010,"This review will cover both volumes of the collection. I am reviewing as a newcomer to the series.

I'm going to start by going over the part that isn't the games themselves: The main menu stuff. Right off the bat you're introduced to a fully voice acted Mega Man.exe who will greet you. There does not appear to be any sort of subtitles option in the release version of the collections, so if you switch the language to one you don't understand you might not get the full benefit of the change in voice actor. Mega Man will greet you every time you boot up the game, and from what I have heard he will even sometimes have different things to say based on the time of day. There's an interact button if you want to make him talk, although the pool of things he has to say doesn't appear to be very large. I so far cannot confirm whether he gains more things to say as you progress in the games. He's overall nothing too complex, but he's a harmless inclusion. If you want him to be quiet, you can also just simply mute him. Pre-orders received cosmetic skins for him, they do nothing other than change his appearance slightly and give him some minor new dialogue. They do not apply to the in-game look, only the main menu.

In regards to other main menu features, it's comparable to the Zero/ZX collection released in 2020. Unlike collections prior to Zero/ZX, there doesn't appear to be any merchandise you can look at or trailers to watch. There's an option to download battle chips, which appears to only work once per save file per game. Volume 2 seems to have a lot more right off the bat. Depending on which volume you're playing at the moment you can listen to the various music from each game and even set one to play as the main menu music, and you have a gallery of artwork based on the games in the volume you're currently in.

As for the games themselves, a noteworthy change compared to previous collections is that entering the collection settings menu doesn't pause the in-game music. I don't really know anything about the content compared to the original releases, but I do know that there's a new font being used for text. There's a filter you can toggle on and off, though the CRT filter of previous collections is missing. It's not really missed in my opinion. With the filter on, there appears to still be stray elements here and there that remain unfiltered, and with the filter off there's still some things that are smoothed out such as certain text elements. It's generally not a big deal, though if you prefer the filter on for some reason you might be annoyed by how many pixels are still visible.

Like previous collections you can choose a border to occupy the space outside of the original aspect ratio. Noteworthy however is the apparent lack of an option to disable borders entirely. If you like having black borders surrounding your retro games instead of stylized artwork, that sadly doesn't seem to be possible here as far as I can tell. You can also choose what size to display the game at on screen. There's small, medium, large, and largest. Largest is as close to full screen as you can get. Testing at 1080p appears to preserve pixel scaling regardless of in-game screen size settings, so you don't have to worry about any misshapen pixels. However, I have heard reports of alternative monitor resolutions not producing perfect pixel scaling. This issue does generally seem to be easier to solve than previous collections however.

A noteworthy inclusion is the new Buster Max mode. This can be toggled both while you are on the main menu and in the collection settings menu in-game at any time. It changes your standard buster attack to do 100 points of damage, trivializing encounters. You can use this as a sort of easy mode, as a way to speed up grinding, or just generally as you see fit. The collection does not punish you for using this in any way, even in regards to achievement collection. It's up to you to decide whether you want to use it or not.

Unfortunately as a newcomer to the series, I don't have much to comment on regarding content inclusions for each game. My understanding is that almost all of the content for each game is here including previously Japanese exclusive content, however my knowledge is limited to the pre-release marketing as I have never played these games before now. I am aware of a new online component regarding trading/battling with other players, but I have not used this feature yet personally.

Overall, the collection doesn't seem to disappoint. It's exactly what it seems to be, and has pretty much everything you could want from such a collection. I'd recommend saving up for the bundle with both volumes and/or waiting for a sale. While I do feel as though the content offered here is worth the release price, I also understand that many people might not be able to afford it at that price. That's okay, don't feel pressured to impulse buy here if it's looking like a bit much for you.",1.0

2508,136683315.0,1798010,"Besides the stupid Denuvo DRM, the game runs pretty smooth with no issues. 

Here you have a collection of battle network games from 1-3, and it seems like the trophys are linked for all 3 games instead of it separately... I'm personally going for a 100% completion which means I have to play it more than once. 

The menus are clean and simple as you are greeted with a Modren 3D model of Megan.exe with the original voice actor from the anime... There is different language options and changing your language does change the logos of the games which is cool but it's still the same game don't be confused that it's some ""different version"" or anything just because of the logo change for another language. 

In terms of gameplay there isn't anything new, it's basically the same gameplay from the GBA games.

Was is new however is buster MAX mode that allows you to do 100x the damage of your normal buster shot, which is EXTREMELY helpful especially for the first game that doesn't have an escape button.... I don't think I have to remind everyone here how much of a labyrinth structure MESS the first game's internet areas are... And because they are a mess you keep running into enemies that without the escape chip your forced to fight, every, single, TIME... But thanks to Buster MAX mode you can make quick work of this mess. It also doesn't effect trophys, so go ahead and use it if you get stuck, it makes grinding for chips and zennys easier too. 

Extra features include the exclusive battle network Japanese only chips that you can immediately download and use at the start of the game.... they are very overpowered in the early game but if you think you feel guilty about using them early don't..... these games spike up in difficulty. There is also the Japanese only 499 patch cards they added but those are separate from these battle chips and you won't be able to use those until Mega Man Battle Network 4 which is in collection 2. 

Capcom also added online fighting and online trading to all the games, I haven't tested these features yet as it's still pretty early for people to be using it. 

There is a HD filter that makes it less pixelated, in my opinion it looks fine and does make it easier on the eyes but that's just me. 

You can also have different custom borders, which is a neat little addition. 

And then you have the usual MegaMan Collection stuff with the art galleries and music players.... You can actually run as specific music piece to play as your main menu theme though so that's nice. 

Overall your getting a lot of bang for your buck here, definitely recommend getting it.",1.0

2514,136713689.0,307950,"Game feels great but being a slow paced TPS game, this is a game of ""peekaboo"", which means everyone and their moms are hiding behind cover and using Third Person view to check for enemies.

Another problem is classes' weapons, in other shooter games, all ""classes"" have weapons that doesn't make them useless, here some operators just have bad weapons and you can't do a thing with it, there is a reason why Medics and Marksman are never used while in other shooters they're always filled first, their weapons SUCKS, marksman in special, they have no option to change to another main weapon so your best bet is either the VSS or a DMR with high fire rate because most ""snipers"" don't kill on headshot and because of that, you're always looking for at least 2 shots to kill people.

Some small problems would be progression, like, you need to play a lot with your operator to ""level him up"" and then unlock passive/talents to bulk him up, you pay an in-game currency for that, I reckon that it should take quite some time (maybe 8~20 hours?) of playtime with an operator to fully unlock him...and then unlock other operators to use their passive on other operators too...in any case, I don't feel like this one is a major problem because it adds progression to the game.

In any case, this game is a hard pass, specially if you're not into TPS shooters, if it were an FPS game then the slow paced combat and the need of awareness would definetely make this a good game, as of now, I can't recommend it to anyone.",0.0
2515,136657215.0,1364020,"- 5v5 matches

- Character classes

- You start out with basic weapons and iron sights. All other weapons and attachments are locked behind scoring dozens or hundreds of kills.

- Movement is a bit slow. This isn't going to scratch the Titanfall or Tribes itch. 

- Seems mechanically sound aside from some issues like roll being slow. 

- MTX, Battle passes, fortnite style funny skins, like the tiger mascot space suit that early backers unlock

- Mechanics are easy to learn if you've done any 6DOF movement game. It took me all of ten minutes and half of that was re-binding keys. If you haven't played 6DOF games before it might be harder to learn, but you shouldn't let it intimidate you. Remember that the enemy gate is down and you'll be fine. 

I wish their was a ""meh"" option instead of yes or no. If you're looking for something different from Fortnite and CoD and CS:GO, and you don't mind grinding for hours to unlock red dot sights, I'd say it's worth checking out, but it's not a strong endorsement. I'm put off by the small teams, the small maps, the inclusion of sniper rifles (in a 6DOF game snipers can go anywhere in the play volume, making them much more frustrating to deal with than in flat games), and the requirement to grind for weapons and equipment in a small team competitive game.",1.0

Music - noticeable loop transition and not very noticable - muted it after 10 minutes of idling.
Gameplay wise it isn't much of an experience, comparable to someone's first text-based weeklong HTML incremental, sadly. This is the main thing holding this back.

I held on after the 2 hour mark just hoping to see something happen but it's just ""numbers go up"" in the most unsatisfying literal sense. Meh.",0.0

I can't believe they released a game without testing. I guess money is more important. + no market research whatsoever. Why release a game on the same time as a bigger studio's hyped beta? The playercount dropped by 22k.  And why release it with so many fucking bugs.

Plus, this game should be free to play with battle-pass and cosmetics. It is not designed to be a paid game, but again, short-term money is more important. If the game stays paid, it will struggle to lift-off (no pun intended).

2535,136655107.0,1364020,"Hello so here is my review. The game has some issues that I'm going to address really quick. The settings has no FOV slider and you cannot edit or customize your in game UI like the mini-map's position. They also have a server issue that I encountered as I was trying to start a match play and just left the game to fix it. Another issue I saw was that your username doesn't show and instead shows the in game names that are random to a degree. Gun customize is very good but feels as tho in certain areas its lacking in the parts and guns. Tilting is slow and needs to be tweaked just a little bit faster in my opinion but others may think otherwise. With all this I still suggest the game and give it a positive review. The reason being is because compare to many other early access, this game is pretty spot on even when I played it in alpha. Gun plays good, movement is good, concept is good, and it gives the itch and customization I'm looking for. I think with a little more time over this year until its full release it can upgrade and add more things as its open to the devs to listen to community and try there best to keep it going. It will need content if they want this game to survive. Eventually they will have ranked but they don't as of currently. I think this game is worth a try and just needs support and feedback as it grows during early access.",1.0

2546,136655586.0,2357670,"Fourteen Fiends! I played this new game and enjoyed the fast paced, card game style RPG almost?? I think its pretty cool that the game ""helps"" you by allowing you to know which of your cards may win the battle vs an enemy, but the system also allows you to do your own strategy, by using item cards you acquire throughout battles and purchasing from the merchant, a very greedy man indeed. I like it when I am completely lost in the game by just testing it out on the first run, I prefer learning by trial and error, and this game takes about two tries til you are getting the hang of the mechanics and beginning to create strategies of your own, of course there are some flaws, like the merchant being greedy and perhaps a little ""math"", but i think that is positive since nowadays too many game hold your hands, anyways...

2553,136714065.0,"1798010,1798020","Its exactly what it claims to be: Its a legacy collection of the MMBN games. Its not a remaster, its not a remake, its all of the games in two packages. They give you extra goodies like artwork, music player, and other things, but please don't go into this assuming its going to be some upgraded reboot with crazy HD features. They never promised that. If you enjoyed MMBN (I definitely did), you'll enjoy this. If you didn't like the MMBN games, you wont enjoy this, Also, its best to play this game with controller. Some people complained about the lack of remappable controls, but I maybe I'm too much of a causal to care. I play most games with controller anyways, especially 2D games. 

The ONLY thing that I don't like about this collection is the Buster Max mode. Its too OP of a option and I hate having the option to take an easy route in games. Id rather the temptation not be there, But considering that its an optional option (Im using that word ""option"" as if I have no other word options), I'm going to keep it turned off. Buster Max will take away the fun of the game for me, but its good for if you revisit areas that you already beat and want to look for any loot you missed without dealing with battles. You also don't want to use Buster Max if you plan on playing online unless you are already a master at the game, otherwise, you wont understand the mechanics of the game and all of the cards and your skills are going to atrophy. You will get deleted like an ""I'm sorry"" text to your ex. 

Overall: Get it! Its really fun! But try not to use Buster Max except for grinding. Play the game the way it was originally meant to be played and you'll have a blasty blast. :)",1.0

Not only that but there are achievements for each version of the game (such as one for completing mmbn5 colonel and another for mmbn5 protoman).

2560,136679263.0,1968710,"I'm not gonna recommend this game. I'm sure people will enjoy it, but for a fully released game, I don't believe there is enough content here to justify its $10 pre-sale price tag. As much as I like the concept, I believe it is held back by a few factors: 
1. The weapon variety isn't fleshed out enough. I think that 4 weapons is good, but the weapons themselves (besides the rocket launcher) didn't bring me to try different playstyles. The minigun is essentially a faster firing pistol, and the shotgun is typically the best gun for most situations.
2. Level design. Aside from a few levels, they mostly play the same. All trucks are the same size, all cars are cars, It would've been cool to use bits of the environment more as a way to navigate. The enemy placement is another thing, and is noticed towards the end especially. They tend to be spread out or condensed, but the AI doesn't like the latter so they tend to trickle towards you unless you rush in.
3. Movement. The movement is fine, and I don't want to compare this to ultrakill too much, but for a game that is all about fast paced movement, it is really difficult to keep up momentum. The only truly fast way of moving is the grapplehook, which stops you at its point. Dashing out of it still loses that momentum. It would have been nice if movement focused on that momentum that surges you forward, since the game forces you to move ahead.
4. Enemies. There is little enemy variety. When combined with weird placement, it feels as though there are no challenges. In my game, the #1 reason I died was the tunnel level, where signs and pipes instakill you. They also kill all of the enemies, so it just becomes ""run forward and dodge."" It would have been nice to see enemies have to be taken out in different ways. Melee enemies are always killed in a kick, but what if they could block it or counter? I never really felt endangered in my time to just run into a group of melee guys and kick them. 
5. Time. It took me 39 minutes to beat the ""main game."" And while yes, there is infinite mode, that is just not for me. I kept expecting as I played through the game that there would be some big moment, something that would test my skills toward the end. Instead, it tests whether you remember to use your grappling hook. It left a sour taste in my mouth. 

To Conclude, it's not a bad game, but because of the factors I mentioned above, I cannot recommend it in its current state. As much as I dislike early access, this game should be labeled it. It doesn't feel like a fully released game, with nominative amount of content for its price. This game ends with a cliffhanger stating that it will be continued, but that isn't enough for me to recommend it. Just because I do not recommend it does not mean it is a bad game, there is probably something there for people, but not for me. 

P.S. for the devs
If you want to improve this game, please prove that it is not a unity asset flip by continuing development. Go beyond being a copy of the clustertruck formula. There's a lot more I could say, but I'll just leave as this: prove me wrong.",0.0

The PvE is absolute garbage, nothing salvagable there, unless the last unlock is good, but I wont be playing anymore to unlock that mode. First mode the missions are shitty voice acted, terribly boring missions that last 10 minutes, one of them at least has the worse boss fight ive ever seen in any shooter I've ever played. Do yourself a favor and stear clear.

PvP is alright, I would play only PvP if I were you, however, prepare to realise you are at a significant disadvantage until you level up your operators, as they get more hp, armor, improved abilities and up to 4 traits at later levels. You can compete, and even win, but you are fighting uphill against players much better equiped than you.

The PvPvE mode Frontline is the only actually good thing about this game I would say, its interesting at least for a couple hours, it gets boring fast, but I can see someone play this game just for that.

Graphics are fine, nothing to write home about
Sound design is just... either missing or just minimum denominator, lazy voice acting, boring gun sounds, I've never been bored firing an SMG in a game, but I sure am here.
Animations are passable, they arent horrible, but you can see some jank

Although managing the group becomes quite a problem after a while I would imagine. It is turn based and you can have 20+? people controlled at once. In single player that certainly sounds excessive, but in co-op it is fine. But late game even in co-op this will become a problem most likely.

Also, I wish there were more camp events, certain companions would form rivalries etc. as they do in Wildermyth but that isn't really in this, you have relationship +1/-1 and thats it, doesnt do much in terms of group dynamic or anything. Or like in XCOM or rimworld where if a character dies in combat it negatively impacts the other people, if they liked the person or positively impacts if they hated the guy or something like that. Needs more flavour events

Also people dying isnt end of the world so I would recommend not save scumming, if somebody dies they die. Sad event but you move on and hire new people, great stuff. Rest in peace Sibric",1.0

This game is about half as long as Chapter One was, even if you do every optional case. That by itself is disappointing, but the story is also really lackluster.

A Lovecraftian story needs to have unexplainable cosmic horror. A Sherlock Holmes story, meanwhile, need to have every mystery explained in impressive detail. So a Lovecraft story where Holmes is the protagonist can't have both; it has to pick one. Either Cthulhu is real, or Sherlock figures out that it was just a squid-shaped hot air balloon that was part of some plan to steal the crown jewels and murder the butler. Frogwares, bizarrely, chose the option of ""neither"". Nothing truly unexplainable happens, and Sherlock never wraps up the mystery.

Three times in the game Sherlock has hallucinations of some alien landscape where he has to solve some (trivially easy) puzzle to get out. Despite there being multiple obvious explanations for the visions, namely that he was drugged and envisioned landscapes that were implanted into him subliminally by all the bizarre paintings hung around the bad guys' lairs. Sherlock suggests that the visions are caused by drugs a few times, but inexplicably dismisses the idea as if it weren't less ridiculous than many of his other deductions in the games (and books). But for some reason, this causes Holmes' sanity to completely unravel. It's like Frogwares wanted to go full-Lovecraft with the story, but didn't have the guts to pull the trigger and have an actual eldritch abomination show up. I know they were somewhat tied to the plot of the original game, but why stick with the original plot when they rebuilt everything else?

Thankfully, there's multiple murder mysteries you get to solve along the way. Unfortunately, they don't get the attention they deserve. The worst example is in the insane asylum when you find the director dead after discovering all the horrible things she was doing to inmates. You examine the body, and then without even determining the killer he's like ""we got what we need, let's get out of here"". It's implied that it was Gerda who killed the director, but since when has a Sherlock Holmes murder been so straightforward? It was such a wasted opportunity for a murder case in an insane asylum. And the game's short length could have used the help.

And on top of all that, the mystery-solving segments are all pretty easy. The most challenging part of them is figuring out what you can interact with (I played on the hard setting where they can't be highlighted). Everything basically falls into place after you find everything to interact with, and the mind palace portions can be easily cheesed by just spamming all your evidence into the equation until something sticks. It's a LOT less challenging than Chapter One was.

2633,136659440.0,2328760,"This review is coming from someone who has no history with Pinball or Pinball FX3!

I'm happy to see this finally make its debut on Steam (after a year of Epic Games exclusivity)! As a newbie to the Pinball scene, I'd say this is a nice entry. You get a few free tables to start with and then can purchase more tables as DLC; this business model of free game + DLCs makes sense as I doubt they could encase every licensed DLC within a single (reasonable) price, and still make it profitable.

The big elephant in the room is that previously, players could transfer their DLCs from Pinball FX2 to Pinball FX3 for free, as those two games ran on the same engine, and thus, there was basically no labour involved to move assets from one entry to another. The problem here is that this title makes the jump to the Unreal Engine, and thus, porting the older tables to this newer game required the devs to do manual work. As such, they're now charging again for these tables, whereas loyal fans are conditioned to expect to be able to transfer their previously purchased tables for free, as they have been able to before. This isn't a problem for new players, but again, fans who have purchased tables before are disappointed.

As an outsider looking in, I can understand the frustration; it can be debated whether the graphics were even improved, and thus, whether it worth jumping to a new engine or not in the first place. People don't want to pay for what's essentially same thing twice. On the other hand, I've seen multiple players act as though they MUST purchase the new DLCs. It's not like you're losing access to the tables you purchased 5+ years ago, those are still accessible in the phenomenal Pinball FX3, thankfully. I think expecting DLCs to be transferable isn't necessarily the norm in the gaming industry, so it's unfortunate that Zen Studios have put themselves in this situation where it's expected of them now. The DLC bundles that offer a discount for those who already own the tables from older games are a nice middle-ground, but not one everyone is satisfied with. I'm not sure what an alternative could be.

I also think the optimization / performance of this game is a bit questionable. I have to play on lowest settings at 720p to reach 60 FPS on my Steam Deck, which is a bit of a bummer. Perhaps this can be ironed out down the line via updates.

As for the game itself, it's Pinball! Lots of tables to checkout, with flashy effects and addictive sound design. I think if you're a newcomer, you'll really enjoy this game (provided you're willing to purchase / rent tables), but if you're a long-time fan, you may only have interest in this game's exclusive tables, and otherwise, you'll likely want to stick to FX3. If previous DLCs were transferable, I'm sure this game would have a much better review score. That's the biggest contention point.",1.0

2636,136657493.0,1091920,"Plantera 2: Golden Acorn is a sequel to the popular farming and idle game, Plantera. It is a relaxing and engaging game where you grow and manage your own garden. The game has colorful and detailed graphics, pleasant music, and simple controls, making it easy to pick up and play.

In this game, your main objective is to collect Golden Acorns that come from the oak tree. These acorns can be used to unlock new features and upgrades. You start with a small garden and gradually expand it by planting various crops and trees and placing decorations. As you progress, you'll encounter different types of crops and animals, each with their own unique characteristics and requirements.

The game also features unwelcome guests like moles, crows, rabbits, and even a UFO, which can eat your crops or dig up your garden, causing damage and reducing your Golden Acorn production. However, you can protect your garden by clicking on them, hiring guard dogs, bees, and scarecrows to chase them away.

Plantera 2: Golden Acorn is a well-designed and enjoyable idle game that provides a relaxing experience. With its fun and engaging gameplay, the ability to expand your garden, and protect it from unwelcome guests, the game is definitely worth playing.

2639,136657415.0,2198070,"This review was written by someone who is somewhat into many game genres, though not very relevant to this genre. I would like to list the important parts that I see in the game without any distinction between positives and negatives. (So ​​you can decide for yourself <3)

- I want to start with the gameplay time. I'm playing the game incredibly slow in a really chill mode. That's why I haven't seen every card and event in the game even though it's been over 8 hours. Therefore, based on the comments made to see all the cards, we can say that it has a gameplay of 8-10 hours. (For the early access version. And this period will be extended with new cards and events to come as long as it stays in early access.)

- Our goal in the game is to create a city based on random cards from our deck. And while doing so, it's important to keep your citizens happy. At this point, we come to the importance of balance. A difficult objective card (the red ones) at the beginning of the game can make your game really difficult as the cards come randomly. But since we depend on a few conditions to lose the game, we can say that the structure is balanced at this point. (At the beginning level of the game, the objective cards can be very difficult. But as you continue playing in a short time, the bonuses gained make this difficulty more bearable.)

- There are troubles, disasters and festivals as random events in the game. Since these are subject to a certain condition, we can slow down or speed up their arrival. I think these random events are enough for the early access phase and add excitement to the game. For example, we can lose our important buildings in case of an earthquake, or we can turn all the cards we draw into road cards with a new feature. (Come on, who likes a leader who doesn't make some road?)

- The map size did not satisfy me. In fact, the game needs to have a more appropriately sized map than it currently has. A map that is too small will not be large enough to accommodate game content. On the other hand, a very large map may show less content than it actually is. I think this needs improvement.

- I think that the small cosmetics on the table other than our game board are enough for now. Definitely an in-game currency and store should come. Or, if additional packages are to be made for the game, such cosmetics should be added to them. (But these will definitely be reserved for the full version of the game and will have no effect on gameplay.)

- Thank you for taking time to read my review. I hope this helped you to get a little idea about the game. Have fun in your Cardboard Town my friend <3",1.0

Before getting to that though, I'm just going to start with my opinion: yes I recommend it, but I'm a MMBN fan so of course I would say that, I want people to get this game so that Capcom could see this be popular and make a new game, so the rest of this review is just trying to be informative. 

Part 1: For New People

The Mega Man Battle Network games were a collection of action RPGs (mostly) for the GBA games. This collection and the simultaneously released Vol 2 contain all of the 6 numbered entries (all except the first two entries were split into 2 versions like Pokemon, hence the ""10 games"" in marketing). This collection contains the first 3, and vol. 2 contains 4-6.

The gameplay is a little difficult to describe. Combat takes place on a 6x3 grid, where the left 3x3 is where you can move around, and the right 3x3 is where your enemies can move. 5 battle chips are drawn from your deck of 30, which you select based on shared letter (think ""suit"" of card) and shared chip type. You battle for 9 seconds, where you can move on the grid, use your chips, and/or your (relatively weak) megabuster.  after which you can choose to return to chip selection, and repeat until the enemy is defeated.  This system is expanded upon as the game goes on and becomes increasingly nuanced and complex (the final entry supports a robust PvP meta, for example), but these basics are upheld. 

This system would later go on to inspire One Step from Eden. Unlike One Step from Eden, however, this game isn't a rougelike. There is a set story, involving Lan Hikari in the real world, who operates Mega Man.exe, his Net Navi, in the cyberworld, in their fight against viruses and a (game-dependent) terrorist organization. Generally Lan moves in the real world, finds a place for Mega Man to ""jack-in"" and enter either a local network or the internet. On the internet, battles come from in the form of random encounters.

The game's stories aren't really their strong point. It is mostly typical shounen fare, often hindered by awkward localization with numerous typos (particularly in BN 4). Most of the fun is derived from improving your chip folder and skills as you fight ever stronger navis. The games have a lot of mechanical depth, particularly the later entries, which lets players spend a lot time tinkering with folder set-up.

In general, 1 and 4 are considered to be the weakest games. 1 is janky in the way that first entries often are, and 4 suffers from a series of poor design decisions and a particularly atrocious translation effort. 3 and 6 are generally considered the highlights. 3 for its post-game and varied settings, and 6 for its gameplay and PvP. Playing the games in order is recommended, but if you aren't enjoying 1, you can try skipping to 6 to see if the series is for you at all. Or 3 if you only have this collection. Speaking of which, this bundle is $40 for the first 3 games, and the other is also $40, but you can get both for $60 if you get the bundle, which you probably should if you think you'll like these games.

Some tips:
1) Buster Max mode is basically a ""cheat"" mode that puts your base buster power to 100 and can let you breeze through the games. Keep this in mind if this is something you are interested in, even if just for speeding up grinding.
2) If you are struggling and don't want to resort to the above, try reducing the number of letter codes in your folder. Putting a bunch of powerful chips is great and all, butt if you are only getting one chip each turn, you are going to be much less effective.
3) The Rockman Exe Zone has a very helpful wiki that is well organized if you ever want to consult a resource.

Part 2: For Everyone

This collection has added online support with a (simplistic) ranked system for battling other players. Not all of the games are balanced, but 6 in particular is balanced in a way which has lead a competitive scene existing for it (and has had decent-sized following for several years now). I expect that to continue in this collection once people have gotten themselves solid collections of chips to participate in it.

Also new to the collection are the ability to gain ""download chips"" which were Japanese only event chips at a press of a button. Similarly, one can use ""patch cards"" which were Japanese-only E-reader cards which were used for a variety of things. Mega Man is also voiced in the title screen, and will have a variety of things to say depending on the circumstances when playing the game. You can look at a variety of artwork and promotion material for the games, and listen to music from the games (and see achievements linked to the Steam achievements).

Part 3: For Existing MMBN Fans

The in game changes are relatively minor. Ever game has a ""buster-max"" mode which lets you put your base megabuster damage to 100 if you want to just skip through some tedious parts of the games. The text has been replaced from the pixelated ones with new high resolution ones. The games are all based on the JP versions, so there isn't any cut content (well, except Botkai Crossover battles in 6 and Beast Gate content), so there is more content than the GBA Western release. You can change languages in the option menu on the same save, which can be nice for those learning Japanese and/or Chinese. There is a filter option which starts as on by default, but you can turn it off (I personally do). There are also borders you can select around the game, but there is no ""no border"" option for those of you who do not like it. Some bugs were patched out, and some were kept in single-player but patched out of PvP battles. Enumerating which were are beyond the scope of this review, but you can check out fan communities for detailed info if you are interested, like Rockman exe corner and Team Battle Network.

Some bugs have been introduced, however. A minor visual one involving sprites looking like they are standing on the player character is somewhat common. More seriously, the MMBN6 Virus Battler rewards currently are set to the ones from the western GBA release which is problematic, so you should change your language to Japanese when doing it until that is fixed.

Another minor annoyance is with the soundtrack currently being a mono version of it, rather than Stereo which was in the GBA games. I imagine there will be a fan patch for this in the near future. Another is that the game used Denuvo. However, Capcom usually removes it a year or two after release, if previous releases are anything to go by, so it probably won't be permanent.",1.0

By the time I got there party was half tired. It also seems like they slowed down pretty much everything just to make it appear that the game is longer than it actually is and they also added some very frustrating grind elements. Combat is punishing and not in a good way. You can lower the difficulty but that makes the game extremely boring. Also party management, unlocks and professions is very poorly implemented. There are some nice elements hidden somewhere under all this bs but I dont have the time or patience to figure all of that out. Might be worth revisiting when it is on a deep sale.",0.0

The first level was short, while some are long and could even be made as their own game.  The detective world was pretty unique, would have liked it if it was expanded on, and the pokemon-esque world was the best one IMO.

Overall, it was enjoyable to play, worth a buy despite it only being around 3 hours.  Would like DLC in the future of some more worlds, hopefully a bit longer in length.",1.0

2662,136661406.0,762370,"Where do I start with [i]EIGTBOK[/i]?

I first played the game on Itch several years ago-- it's been long enough now that I truly can't remember how I originally found it. I could've just been looking for new and unique indie games. Boy, did I get my wish.

A little context here, since people read reviews to see if they'll like something or not: [i]EIGTBOK[/i] is a fantastic collection of bizarre and engaging little minigames and hidden secrets on the world's weirdest desktop, but it's also what many would weightily appellate an ""Art Game™"", so if you get cold feet about an author being frank and open about their life or your adventures through multicolor cyberspace occasionally being interrupted by grim reminders of the real world, go now or forever hold your peace.

There, that's your tl;dr.

Still here? Good. I like you.

[i]Everything is going to be OK[/i] is not just a game about the Internet, or trauma, or the stress of being an artist. It is a stupendous crescendo to the author's previous works in the vein of web art, spanning everywhere from [i]BlueSuburbia[/i] (waiting with baited breath for that remake...) to [i]Tetrageddon[/i], and far predating pale imitators like Hypnospace Outlaw and the endless parade of other Weird Desktop Simulators we've seen in more recent years. It is the work of someone who is truly in love with their medium of choice. Nothing included is there to snag a merch deal with Hot Topic or turn into a popular Twitter meme, it's all painfully genuine, even and especially the silliest bits. 

It almost feels a little too intimate at times-- wading through the cheerfully suicidal bunnies and whimsically creaking cyberbones, it feels a bit like peaking into someone's very old and very weathered diary, new sheaves of paper shoved in every few years or so to extend its life, and consequentially expand your view of the feelings and events described within. It's fitting that so much of the more hidden content in the game is literal poetry.

Every playthrough I try to go through the little ritual of wading through the numbered programs in ""order"" (Numbered 'Pages', then 'missing' pages), but it's inevitable that anyone would get lost on the labyrinth somewhere along the way. This is what I would consider a feature, not a bug. Further down the line, several applications you find seem to be re-purposed or reinvigorated Alienmelon projects from days of yore, frankensteined back to life here for your enjoyment. Contest entries, desktop pets, other programs of obscure origin and even vaguer purpose. It is, and I mean this as high praise, a shockingly dense text for a solo project.

Replaying it for this review, I even found new things I somehow hadn't stumbled across before-- I'm STILL not sure how many sound effects are in the duckmonkey music minigame, for example. I can't imagine how long that must've taken to record and program. And towards the end I discovered an entire essay, hiding away in one small button. (No, I won't tell you where. That's for YOU to figure out!)

Everything Is Going To Be OK has made me cackle like a madman. It has made me contemplate my own life and the choices I've made. It has made me cry like a child. But, most pertinently to the point I am trying to make, again and again it restores my faith in video games as an art and storytelling medium. Maybe everything really [i]is[/i] going to be okay.

...Also, like, it's been in the MoMA. If that sweetens the pot for you at all.

2669,136712737.0,2329130,"Rewind or Die"" is a thrilling and gruesome horror game that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. As a fan of Puppet Combo's previous works, I was excited to try out their latest creation and I wasn't disappointed.

The game's retro aesthetic and VHS-style visuals create a truly immersive and nostalgic experience, reminiscent of classic horror films from the 80s and 90s. The gameplay is challenging, but never feels unfair or frustrating, as you navigate through eerie environments and encounter terrifying enemies.

One of the standout features of ""Rewind or Die"" is its unique ""rewind"" mechanic, which allows players to go back in time and try again if they meet a gruesome end. This adds an interesting layer of strategy to the game, as you must plan your movements and actions carefully in order to avoid being killed.

The sound design in ""Rewind or Die"" is also worth mentioning, as it adds to the game's overall atmosphere and sense of dread. The music and sound effects are expertly crafted to create an unsettling and immersive experience.

Overall, ""Rewind or Die"" is a fantastic horror game that I would highly recommend to fans of the genre, especially those who appreciate Puppet Combo's unique and creative approach to horror gaming. With its retro style, challenging gameplay, and innovative mechanics, ""Rewind or Die"" is sure to keep you entertained and terrified for hours on end.",1.0

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
    [*]The setting - Like I said earlier, the level design and visuals are fantastic, definitely up there with the rest of the Torture Star/Puppet Combo games. If anything, it might even take the #1 spot.
    [*]The villain - Not too much to say here as most villains in these games don't get much development past their looks and actions. The pig look is freaky and cool looking, and his sprint animation is pretty scary too.
    [*]The scares - If you're not into random and unnecessary jump scares, this game might annoy you. But they got me good and I enjoyed them, so it's a pro for me.
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
    [*]The music - There is not a lot of music in this game. Not a huge deal, but my biggest issue is with the chase music, which you're going to hear a lot. The heavy metal song itself sounds cool, but it really takes me out of the experience. It's not scary at all, it's only startling because that means you're about to be chased.
    [*]The puzzles - You can turn your brain off for the entire game basically. The most engaging parts of the game were the sudden jump scares and chases. 
    [*]No sense of urgency - I never felt on edge except for one chapter of the game, where the killer is actually roaming around the level. Take Murderhouse or Stay Out Of The House for example, you have to complete puzzles WHILE the killer is actively looking for you, I always felt extremely anxious entering new rooms in those games. The killer, aside from scripted sequences, is no where near you for the majority of this game.

The game felt like it was about to get really good the entire time, and then it just ended. Unfortunate, because I did enjoy my time for a little bit; it just fell super flat.

My personal experience with this game has been nothing but positive. Extremely positive, actually. I died a lot, the game is hard, but I enjoyed every second of it. It's just a fun, really fresh game with a bit of a learning curve. If you are sitting here juggling the idea of buying the game, I'd say go for it and see what you think for yourself. Just be ready to learn, and don't give up. A game has not hooked me like this in a long time - if you enjoy the genre, it's worth your time.

I have watched streamers for many more hours playing it, besides my own experience with the game. It does not deserve the mixed reviews. Personally I put it up there after Monster Train and Vault of the Void. Two of the best card games in my opinion.

The first runs, on the starting difficulty are easy. And I have died 15+ times before beating the boss the first time. Wildfrost expects you to pay attention to the board, plan your moves. Your dmg output and your HP pool. The action economy instead of mana is implemented in a genious way, but in the end, it is a game you have to learn to play as if it was your first card game. And that is what I believe makes everyone think it is unballanced. Your skills from other card games come into this one, but you have to adapt them.

I would highly suggest catching a stream of Celerity or Esty8nine on twitch if you are not sure if Wildfrost is for you. The communities there are awesome, and can help you decide.

Every run is so interesting, the cards interact in so many ways depending on the board and the modifiers on them (charms).  It is crazy how polished the game is mechanically. The run variety is amazing. The unlocks add to the complexity of the game gradually. There are 3 factions that play quite differently. And overall feels so fresh in a game genre where the majority of games are more of the same formula, or not so good attempts to innovate.

I'm writing this review because I really enjoy this game and I'm deeply saddened to see so many negative reviews, especially when I disagree with their theses.

A lot of the negative reviews focus on game balance, and RNG.
To preface, I've played both demo cycles of this game, and have currently won two runs. (9 hrs of playtime)
I think it would definitely be good if some cards got re-balance love, but most cards are very obviously good, or not so good. This is very normal for rogue-like deckbuilders! Some tools are bad, unless you're already severely lacking in them.
This game isn't necessarily easy, despite the art style, and you should not necessarily win every run!

I believe a lot of players are either not thinking through their turns properly, or are not used to the style of gameplay this game revolves around (Each unit has a turn timer until it triggers). The rng in this game is sometimes punishing (as is the nature of rogue-likes), but it never feels unfair. If your deck is based around abusing a single mechanic, prepare to lose if you find yourself against a horde of enemies built to counter it! Building decks with tools to counter your counters is essential.

I think the game could benefit from some ui quality of life changes, (hovering over enemy charms and being able to see their effects, undoing held cards is sometimes finicky), but overall this game is amazing. I highly recommend it.",1.0

2704,136656075.0,2328760,"I love Pinball FX3 and 2 and have played about 530 hours in both games. I didn't like Zen's move to be Epic-inclusive for some time (a year or so), but understand that they had to do it because of financial reasons.

Now that FX is finally available on Steam I was excited and had my wallet ready to buy all tables at launch, something I had done in all those years of FX2 and FX3. But the wait was not worth it.

Table physics are better and more realistic now, not just on real-life machines (Williams tables etc.), but on all of them. As I haven't really played the real machines, the physics of FX3 were ok to me...but I guess, they are better now...so it's a point for Zen.

However, there's not more to like at the moment...

+/good:
1) Physics
2) New tables available

~/average:
You have to buy all tables you own in FX3 again. It's understandable though as nobody works for free.

-/bad:

1) The whole idea to launch FX instead of keeping FX3 and releasing new tables for it

2) UI and menus: I prefer FX3. In the German localization a lot of menus have shortened text that looks odd. Filtering tables and tournaments is tedious and fiddly.

3) Option menu: You cannot even assign buttons freely, but have to use presets. A to shoot, B to change camera like I'm used to from FX3 is not possible.

4) The graphics are a bit better, but at first glance, the remastered FX3 tables just look like there was a cheap filter or effect added. I am used to the old look and graphics...they were good enough.

5) ""Modern"" full-color DMD: I'm 43 and used to the charm of retro displays. I know some new real-life machines such as The Hobbit have full-color DMDs with actual film footage, but I don't like them either. I prefer the old look.

[list]
    [*][b]Pixel art[/b]: The pixel art, as evident from the screenshots, is gorgeous. There's lots of little details, like the grass being pushed down under your feet as you walk over it, that are easy to overlook but definitely add up to something beautiful.
    [*][b]Grappling, in theory[/b]: The grappling, when it works, is great. Slingshotting yourself over hazards is satisfying.
[/list]

[h1]The Not-As-Good[/h1]
[list]
    [*][b]Grappling, in practice[/b]: There is basically no tutorial section or guidance on how to utilize the grappling system to its greatest potential. Many times during boss fights I would think, [i]how the hell am I supposed to avoid that attack?[/i] because I couldn't find a way to grapple that allowed me to...you know...avoid the attack. This made some fights feel like marathon slogs because of one seemingly impossible-to-dodge attack. (Yes, I'm sure there's been no-hit runs of this game. No, I'm not capable of such a feat.) Many jumping puzzles look possible to do with your current ability set, but are actually meant for later in the game once you have new abilities -- however, no obvious indication is given that you're wasting your time. Many jumps are [i]just[/i] out of reach, and when you don't make them, it creates a moment of ""Am I just messing up grappling hook physics, or is this legitimately not possible to do at this point?""
    [*][b]Player guns[/b]: I found that I basically always had to have the trinket that extends the range of my bullets attached because, otherwise, it seemed like I had to basically be kissing the bosses in order to hit them. And when every boss is capable of killing you in 2-3 hits, being so close simply is not a feasible strategy at times unless you've managed to memorize every attack of every phase. With the paltry coinage that enemies dropped, I found myself wanting to avoid fighting enemies because the gunplay is so mediocre at the best of times that I didn't want to risk losing health (or worse, dying and losing a chunk of progress) because I had to be on top of the enemies in order to hit them. I mean, the first gun that the game gives you is basically a rapid-fire charge gun. Why do I have to be four feet away from the target to effectively use it?
    [*][b]Difficulty[/b]: I was prepared for a challenge. I wasn't prepared for an amazingly un-fun challenge. Don't know how to use the grapple effectively because the game didn't teach you the basics? Have fun trying one puzzle jump dozens of times until, somehow, you manage to make it across...only to be faced with [i]another[/i] puzzle jump that requires multiple attempts. And don't you dare die at this point, because death sends you back to your last save and undoes all of your progress -- say goodbye to completed rooms and acquired items, and have fun going to get them again.
    [*][b]Protagonist, or lack thereof[/b]: I read the dialogue. I found bits of lore. And I'm still REALLY confused on who I'm supposed to root for in this game. You'd think the player character, right? Well, no, she blew up a lab full of innocents to kickstart the game, and she thinks a story where everyone in a village drowns for no reason is ""humorous."" Maybe the characters we fight are the ones to support- ah, no, apparently they kill kids and torture the fae. I played up through three or four major bosses and about a dozen map regions, and I didn't find a single character that I liked and/or wanted to support. EVERYONE seems like a terrible, terrible person.
    [*][b]One grapple per boots-on-the-ground[/b]: Maybe this is fixed by a later ability, but with a grappling hook, doesn't it make sense to want to chain together grapples through difficult areas in order to create a satisfying series of jumps? Locking the grapple ability to once per use until you land on the ground again made every jumping section a case of ""How do I get to that patch of ground. Okay, how do I get to THAT patch of ground. Okay, now how about THAT patch of ground."" Really feels like a missed opportunity to create some interesting and challenging platforming sections.
    [*][b]Discerning important objects from each other[/b]: Many boss fights were made more difficult for me simply because I couldn't tell what was my bullet, what was an enemy bullet/sword/whatever, what part of the boss (if any) caused contact damage and when, and what was a background element. For instance, with the boss fight with all the swords (for those who played to that part, you know the one), I found that, in phase 2, the swords that locked onto your position were colored like they were in the background right up until they fly directly at you from eight feet away.
    [*][b]Healing, grenades, and One Bar to Charge Them All[/b]: the devs took a page from Hollow Knight's book and tied both your heal and your ranged attack to a chargeable meter. But whereas Hollow Knight made that an obvious and integral part of the game, I found myself chipping away at enemies trying to slowly charge the bar just so I could get another weak heal out of it. I never used the ranged attack other than to open doors that required it because, well, why would I waste my mana on a ranged attack that is VERY easy to miss when I could instead save it for another heal that could potentially save me from having to restart a platforming section or a challenging boss?

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
If you're hard up for a ""Metroidvania"" (I use that term loosely here, since new movement/traversal abilites seem very sparse at least in the early game) and want to try a game with interesting-but-confusing movement mechanics, consider Rusted Moss. If you just want another Metroidvania, grab...literally anything else in the genre, honestly.

EDIT: I just checked, and seriously? Achievements tied to speedrunning with certain completion requirements? Oh, **** off.",0.0
2716,136657460.0,1772830,"Games pretty fun. It's very open after the tutorial boss with lots of places to explore and items to find though some areas are much more difficult to do earlier. I generally haven't liked grapple systems in the games I've played but this one worked for some reason. Combat is pretty eh, it's not really bad but I don't think there is much to write home about. It's mostly trivial with a few exceptions that require a fairly high degree of precision(It's mostly contained to 1 area). A few times they make you do combat in weird scenarios which I like but there are also quite a lot of boring battle rooms where you just fight 3-5 generic enemies in a boring battle arena. Death is fairly punishing though outside of one area save points are pretty abundant. The mediocre combat is made up for by the platforming segments being extremely fun and reward creativity with most of them having multiple ways of going about them depending on your skill with the games physics engine. There is also a ton of speed tech you can learn if you want to go fast. There are few bugs but none of them were very disruptive and it seems like they'll be patched out soon.

2721,136710921.0,2329130,"Right. I have a lot positive to say, and very little negative. Like, no negatives at all. And for reference, I did 2 playthroughs for testing on both the Steam Deck and standard Windows PC, and I can safely say this is one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a while. It absolutely doesn't waste your time, and absolutely rewards replays. I will cover what I enjoyed, cause there's nothing I disliked, and then talk about some wee bugs I encountered, which weren't game breaking or anything, so they weren't bad... at all, really. And also in the case of Steam Deck, it could be down to the preset Proton it uses causing issues.

So what are the positives?
-Amazing music
-Fun characters. I am british, and the game is british, so it's a no brainer that I enjoyed the humour that comes from the characters. I absolutely appreciated the design of the killer too
-Amazing artstyle and colour scheme
-The easter egg(s) and references to pop culture were enjoyable to find and understand
-The game is only about 4 hours long per playthrough, which is short and sweet, and something I appreciate alot more as I grow older
-Just play the game, you'll understand more fully. It's absolutely worth every playthrough.

You mentioned issues with the game?!?!!??!?
Barely, but yes, which is absolutely why I did two playthroughs, just to see what the difference between Steam Deck and my laptop were.....but there still weren't alot of issues, either. Pretty much all it comes down to is:
-Steam Deck had some flickering textures, some minor performance stutters, but only really affected my experience for a few seconds everytime it happened. I played on Handheld at 60hz, but didn't test docked because I'm too lazy to plug it in again. But if you only have a Steam Deck, you won't have any real issues with it on there, and the trackpads will also be very helpful in your adventure, and you have to be absolutely mindful of Proton, especially when the game is unsupported, there is no real telling what exactly will happen with the game, so do keep that in mind
-Game specific...... I found a way to glitch deeper beside a locker with the door in the security room by just walking into it while it was opening up, and moving the camera around a bit to get yourself fully lodged in there. But literally all you have to do to get out is close the door and it'll send you flying to the other side of the room. I don't even see it as an issue, it's quite entertaining to do. I couldn't find any issues the Steam Deck didn't have already, so both experiences are absolutely amazing from the getgo.

So overall?
I've never been so hooked on a game in my life, and I really do mean that. Especially because of the length of the game, I couldn't help but just continue playing till the end, and even to 100% every achievement. The environment is so pretty to look at, you can pet the dog and enjoy a nifty 4 hour tale about a pig killer doing killer things. Not much else to say, apart from what was already in the bullet points..... ALTHOUGH, do not play with the VHS filter off. The flickering becomes much more of a problem with it off, and even shows off unique flickering to the filter being off, which I suppose the VHS filter is able to hide. It definitely ruins the vibe of the game, but I totally get why such a feature is implemented, and I'm not gonna put that as a negative for it. It's helpful for those that need it, but at least currently, it's quite hard to look at. But otherwise, the game is amazing, and you should absolutely play it now.",1.0
2722,136785992.0,2338410,"I really like the controls, they are simple and work really well but I dislike almost everything else.
The style of the game and the musics are pretty good too.

There is 28 arenas but they all feel the same and are very small.
You have a random powerup spawner in the middle, some walls around it and environmental hazards like lasers and fires that can damage the cars most of the time located in the edges of the map.
There is no reward for exploration since the spawner is alway in the middle, there isn't several of them and there is no destructible walls or anything like that.

The powerups aren't very satisfying to use.
One give you extra speed but you don't care because the arenas are super cramped anyway.
There is one that give you youre special but the way it work is meh.
You press right mouse button then you see youre character appear in youre screen and every opponent on the map instantly die from what I understand.
Would've been cool if every character had a different specials and also if you would have to aim with it instead of just killing everybody on the spot.
Apart from that there is the health and invincibility ones that are self explanatory.

The story is badly made but it's because the developper is clearly a kid.
I'm not an english speaker but the way the characters speak is very rudimentary.
The story present itself on the form of very slow powerpoints between each battles you do but you can't skip these and you can't click to make the pages pass faster.
Imo the story us pretty cringy but since the developper is a kid I'll cut him some slack, I don't care about the story anyway, I was here for the gameplay.

The way you fight is very meh.
Imagine you are playing Twisted Metal so you have the base machinegun that you can alway shoot with because it has infinite ammo, but you have no other weapons apart from the special that spawn from time to time for you or a bot to pick up and again, you don't have to aim with it, it just kill everybody on the map.
That's honestly boring.
Also there isn't really physics in this game, so you can't push the bots into the hazards to kill them and there is also no collision damage from what I've seen.
The only creative thing you can do is wait for them to get stuck into a hazard or a wall and stay on their ass to prevent them from backing out or turning while shooting them for extra damage.

There is 4 different characters but apart from them having different storys and endings, there isn't much point to having several of them because they all play the same, their cars aren't very different apart from their colours and the special is the same for each of them.

If you are reading this dev please don't take this review personally because you have a lot of potential.
Imo making a game like that as a kid is pretty impressive.
The controls are so f*cking good, I like the idea of steering with the mouse and having the possibility to freelook with it by pressing the middle mouse button.
The game look cool, I love it's Tron style and the electronic music.
I feel what hurt it the most is that there isn't enough variety in gameplay like in old games like Twisted Metal or Vigilante 8 apart from the characters having each their storys and endings.

A: You can select the regions you want to connect to on the matchmaking tab, it'll take a bit of time before everyone sees this and goes to their respective regions. (side note I want the game to remember what regions I have selected when I reboot it)

B: The game just came out in EARLY ACCESS of course it is not going to have a major amount of content because that takes time. (I would very much like to see a competitive game mode and also some modes with more than 5v5)

Since you're in space, where there is no air, you have have 2 health bars, One is your suit, the more you get hit, the more it will go down but sometimes it will become punctured in which you need to patch it up, which doesn't take long but the more you wait, the more it will drain your second health bar, oxygen, if it runs out then you pass out and die, pretty simple, the only time you have to worry about running out is if your suit is punctured. 

This game is a dream to play, the gun play is pretty cool due to there being nothing quite like it on the market. The zero gravity really flips how you think about recoil and range. Also the physics are very interesting, with your gun's recoil pushing you back certain distances depending on the type of ammo fired. As well as on certain maps you can pressurize rooms which eliminates your oxygen bar while you are in the room, you can also open a door which will launch you out into the map (think of the gravity launchers in Apex Legends).

You can also customize your astronaut which is cool but I wish there were more cosmetics (probably will come with time; side note I really, really want country flags as patches).

2740,136729443.0,1811990,"I loved the Demo! But the full release game is crippling in difficulty. The first boss you'll face is relatively easy. To give you an idea, you'll have 1 mini boss fight. After that you'll get 2-3 random bonuses you can collect. It may be an extra hero card or it can be a charm to boost a single cards damage. Then you fight the second mini boss. This one is a bit tougher and whatever you've set yourself up for will decide whether you get destroyed quickly. If the 1st fight is a 2/10 for difficulty, I'd say the second one is a 4/10.

After you beat the second boss you'll get another 2-3 bonuses including an option to visit a shop to buy charms or cards with the money you earned on the last 2 fights. What you do at this point is extremely important and if you feel like you've barely made it through the second fight then you might as well just start over because the 3rd fight is easily a 10/10 for difficulty and it's brutal. It's the ""main boss"" fight for this chapter of the game. The mechanics and how quickly the enemies advances is nearly impossible if you don't look up a card meta which just always seems silly to me in video games. Like why look up a meta so that I can auto pilot an adventure game just to say I beat it. You might as well hire a robot to beat the game for you. Anyway, I digress.

The issue here is that you've literally only fought 2 battles at this point. Now the 3rd being the main boss fight and only 6 chances to gear up seems pretty crazy considering the boss mechanics. You will fight 1 of 2 main bosses here but they both have a similar second phase mechanic where they either split into 2 smaller version of themselves or they gain 1 attack every single time they hit you. One of the bosses comes out with a hero card with a turn cooldown of 1. So it has a turn every round. Oh yeah, that same card gains 1 attack each turn. So it just snowballs damage. So while you have 3-4 cards on the field, the enemy has all 5. 2 of which are snowballing damage, 1 gives you a debuff that doubles your damage received, and the other does equal damage to its health every 3rd turn which is 6 damage. Most hero cards only have 5-8 health lol.

It's an absolute shit show of a fight and at first I was like ""I enjoy a challenge. I'll start building a deck and creating a cool build to do this fight"" and in 5 hours, 25 runs later, I beat it once only to die right after on the second chapter on the first fight.

The boss fights really need nerfed. I think the damages are fine and add a challenging component to deck building but 3 fights? dude. I cant even get out of the first chapter. I'm tired of seeing the snow. Devs. PLEASE. HOW DID THIS EVEN GET BETA TESTED LIKE THIS.",0.0

If you like doom-alikes, you'll love this. Fun shoot-n-scoot gameplay, intermixed with the occasional end-of-level bosses. Great ambience, gritty and moody lighting, interesting levels, variety of monsters and weapons to take them down.

Tips: Strafe often! Keep your shotgun handy (and rarely let your finger off the trigger!) And, don't be afraid to be a save-scummer -- you'll die often, and restarting at the beginning of a level is a PITA!

Kudos to the devs for making such a fun game! =)

Yep, you read that right. The remake of the classic SH game The Awakened is fantastic and the expanded storyline alongside the the side cases (which are quite a lot compared to what I expected) make it so much better than the original. I am a proud backer of the kickstarter campaign for this project. I have no regrets. It was worth it.

The story is almost the same, some minor changes here and there. It was rewritten to fit in the new timeline. There are some references to Chapter One but if you're a new player, don't worry. You can play it as a standalone game. You are in for a real treat !

The characters, what can I say ? The chemistry between the new friends-to-be Holmes and Watson is on point. This journey tests their relationship to the maximum.

The music is splendid. It makes the experience even more immersive. The dark atmoshpere of the game is *chef's kiss*.

The gameplay mechanics are the same as Chapter One's with some little differences. There is the mind palace (which is different from the previous games), deductions, pin an evidence to search for more clues, interact with people, you can change Holmes and Watson's clother.

The graphics are great, the game ran very smoothly. The team did a great job in optimizing it.

Frogwares deserves all the praise and our respect for what they've done. Delivering a game in such tough times and in so little time...it's incredible. The game was announced in July 2022 and now in April 2023 we are playing it. Frogwares, I take my hat off before you ! Well done !",1.0

2757,136684487.0,1811990,"Art and music are amazing, and despite the ""serviceable"" gameplay they make the game still worth playing. However, do remember by purchasing you're directly supporting Chucklefish, who are an exploitative and abusive company.

What's wrong with the gameplay? I'm an A20H Slay the Spire player, and because I was expecting this to be a contender to StS, I'm going to judge it relative to that. If you're not looking for a StS-like experience, then take the below with a grain of salt. I also only played for 2 hours, so I can't comment on how the game changes as you unlock more items.

In general, the most disappointing part of the experience was the lack of agency. I felt that playing only one card per turn significantly reduced the sense of control, despite turns being more numerous and shorter than StS. Being able to also move units does not add much to the decision space, as it's usually obvious what the best positioning is.

Outside of combat, the pathing options are reduced (Monster Train style), and there is a complete lack of events - your choice are usually card removal, gold, a shop, a card or a charm.  

From the few relics I saw, these appear to be far less interesting than other deckbuilders. The only relics I saw in my gametime affected card draw/other uninteresting things. There are also no card upgrades, but you can add effects to cards using charms.

All of this made me question the long term replayability of the game, as there simply isn't enough variation in the gameplay, or enough interesting decisions to make, for me to see myself putting even 50+ hours into this. Not to mention the lack of ascensions, beyond what I hear is simply adding random charms to enemies, which is a very lazy way to scale difficulty.

And finally, be warned that the game *is* reasonably difficult, but I did beat the first two bosses within my 2hr playtime. The difficulty of the game is a really weird design choice, as the lack of agency (and the cute artwork) really make you expect to be able to breeze through, and that's clear from the negative reviews the game is getting. This game really needs to decide who its core audience is, because right now it's appealing to neither the die-hard deckbuilder fans nor the casual players.

2788,136656394.0,1811990,"This is definitely one of my favorite roguelike deckbuilders, up there with Slay the Spire and Across the Obelisk. The art and music are fantastic and the game is fun. There several different factions, each with multiple playstyles to ensure each run feels different. It's a difficult game. It definitely encourages you to think out every move. It punishes your for mistakes but it doesn't feel unfair. The runs are also short enough that losing doesn't feel terrible. My only outstanding question at this point is how replayable the game is once you beat the boss.

At the time of writing this the game is getting review bombed and I'm not sure why. It definitely doesn't deserve it. People are saying it's too hard and unbalanced. Yes the game is difficult, but to me it feels about the same level of difficulty as Slay the Spire. I've done about 20ish runs or so at this point and made it to the final boss twice. I died there once due to bad luck and once due to my own misplays. I would also disagree that the game is unbalanced. Each playstyle (thorns, poison, frost, etc.) can be super powerful if built into, but they all have their counters. The game will try to find a weakspot in your deck, but you can learn from that and exploit the enemies weaknesses too. 

All in all, it's an awesome game that deserves more love.",1.0
2789,136682300.0,1811990,"I really enjoy this game. art is great and the random rng is actually fun with forcing you to make interesting mixes of comps and strats. The balance obviously seems a little off for casual play because there is a lot going on per turn as well as not paying attention to 1 turn could mean you get wiped. The trinket system is really cool and I would like to see that polished with more options to make your own custom cards in combat more. I think if the enemies were a little less responsive so quickly or reinforcement counter was like a turn longer it might flesh it out more.

Just my opinion. For the hero you start with, maybe add a little more pizzazz to them like with hero options:
--
Better stat hero
--
Hard focus strategy hero
--
more than one status effect
--

Around those options only because, starting with a 3 health range hero with long shot feels pretty bad when your random companion rng isn't a tank. I like the game, difficulty is always weird with people in rouges but it comes with the territory.",1.0

HOWEVER, the other reviews are correct in that this game desperately needs a balance pass. Certain builds will work great until you encounter a specific boss. For example, using a thorn/smackback build will always fail against King Moko (a boss that requires you hit them repeatedly and quickly). 

In addition, the mechanic that the final boss uses can easily prevent you from ever winning the game again. On my first (and only) win I had a build that was absolutely insane. Because of that, the final boss is now virtually impossible to beat.",1.0

2793,136681262.0,1772830,"Just finished 100%

I liked the game (obviously) but here's my main criticisms:

Because most the game is gated by the skill you need from your grappling hook, you can go almost anywhere from the get go, while most skills afterwards just make your hook easier to use. This is cool for exploration- but in turn you can get super deep into a section of the map just to hit a brick wall requiring a certain item right before the end (looking at you, Lab)

Also expect some bugs- like the item tracker being wrong for one area of the game, or one section of the map where I literally had to glitch through a wall to make it into (still no idea what the intended route for that was)

The story is a bit messy, especially how the end feels rushed together, and the combat in general really isn't that enjoyable. The pistol is the only fun weapon to use, but you spend most the game using the rocket launcher because it comes paired with necessary movement options

And lmao shoutouts to the trinket you get halfway into the game that makes the UI legible, why would that not just be a default thing

That said, I'm a big deckbuilder fan and have spent hundreds of hours playing these kinds of games, and it took me ten hours before I won a run, and I feel like rng has a big part in whether you get the necessary tools to win or not.

I really enjoyed the game from start to finish. Some cheesy gimmick scares at times, but overall the scares were on point and so was the heartwarming and sad story that came with it all

PROS:

+Great scares
+Great atmosphere, graphics and sound quality. Everything in this game from an atmosphere standpoint was on point. 
+Easy learning curve and controls. Many indie titles are a bit rough controls wise but this was on point. When the rooms went dark, I could still navigate myself enough around to proceed with the objectives
+Very sad story that wrapped up nicely at the end. A bit ambiguous of an ending, but I think I understand what happened. It was sad but heartwarming at the same time. It concludes the darkness.
+A Free roam option added on. Just an added bonus.

CONS: 

-Sometimes scares can be a bit cliche, as in we've seen that style of scare so many times. But overall they're effective
-Short, but you essentially get what you pay for. Great price for this level of content and a lot to offer.

The worst part is that before release, someone in the discussions for this game called this out as unfun and the dev just didn't fix it. I hate to be hard on this game but it's not a fun mechanic. Coupled with the lack of proper controller support (key binding is not the same as controller support), the weird audio issues (game somehow launched on first start at 500% master, plus whenever you go into the pause or level up menu the sound distorts), and that the controls somehow deteriorated as gameplay progressed and this is a pretty solid not recommend.

Also, allow me to also say, this is a remake of a 2006 game I never played. So take that for what you will.

(For anyone who wants a taste, the Demo starts in the first section of Chapter Three. Just far enough learn the mechanics of the game, but also enough to wonder how you got there and where it will end.)

Right now though. You are, of course, Sherlock Holmes. And you are freshly transported to London from your times in Cordona (ala Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One). You and your new acquaintance John Watson (who suspiciously reminds you of your imaginary friend Jon) have decided to take up and room with one another. Then, after a string of events, Sherlock has been lead to the case of a recently kidnapped individual, which is where our game starts. Naturally, he investigates, which leads him down a rabbit hole that leaves him questioning most of what he knows.

As a longtime FrogWares fan, I can see both new and returning mechanics. The Awakening is a sprawling tale, yet also a singular story from start to end. Which is a departure from their previous works. Gone are the wide open landscapes of Chapter One, the giant world that is Cordona and the multiple story lines drawn within, eager for exploration. What is brought back is the episodic nature that is Crime and Punishment and The Devils' Daughter. Each of those games have singular stories where you, the player find the clues, point your finger at the ne'er-do'-well, and solve the case. Only to go on to the next unconnected case. 

Now, you have a mesh of the two. There is no sprawling world, and each map is its own entity, but each chapter transition leads you further into the same, greater story. And perhaps, a little further into madness... 

One more note, I would *very highly* recommend playing FrogWare's Chapter One before this game. It's not at all necessary, but I feel as though it sheds a lot of light onto Sherlock's motivations in The Awakened.",1.0

The story was masterfully written and filled with character and depth that can only be appreciated more with further playthroughs to explore the branching paths that go against our natural instincts.

The story beats kept me guessing too, with meticulously hand-picked dialogue choices that thankfully rarely, if ever, offered aid or a new perspective on any situation. Without spoiling any story details, Tron: Identity hides consequences within even the most well intended choices, and with an auto-save after every choice. I really felt my characters emotions whenever something didn’t go my way, either due to an immediate branching choice, or one I made earlier. As I am one who likes to always make the right choices in these kind of games, Tron: Identity really challenged that, never giving even the subtlest hint at what the “right” choice is in any situation. They all have consequences in some way or another, even those that you may consider to be the morally right choice. I’d even go so far to say it may be difficult on a second playthrough to get the “best” outcome from every branching path.

A quote from the game that sums up my experience perfectly is “you’ve seen where good intentions can lead”.",1.0

This is a really nice, scary and atmospheric indie horror game that came out today. The graphics are not ultra-realistic but they are good, the sound is good, the story is nice but short, I've found no bugs, no performance issues and not many puzzles are featured in the game (you mostly need to find objects in order to advance in the story, which is good for people looking for a horror game, not a 'puzzle' horror game). I've liked most of the things about this game besides the price (around 9$) that is a bit much for a 30 min game, just my opinion.

It's a charming city builder with a fantasy/fairy-tale vibe, and it sets itself apart by allowing you to form marriages, alliances, and invade other princes and princesses. There is also a split between peasants, commoners, nobles, and their quarters and needs, which is actually pretty charming.

As a seasoned CS and Siege player i agree with everyone saying Breachers is like a VR hybrid of the two in all the best ways and that it has the core for a great competitive scene in place from the get go. 

That said, the game still needs an actual competitive mode that let's you play a match from beginning to end with the same team. Currently only ""old school"" dedicated servers are around and that means that people jump in and out of matches and immature people (kids or not) are there to piss you off from time to time. A ranked system with proper ban system would sort this out.

2863,136711502.0,1811990,"I don' typically write reviews for games, which is on me. I should write more. However, when I heard on NL's Twitch that this game had a near 50% review, I was baffled. The negative reviews I've read about this game so far are ridiculous. I don't mean that as a stab against those who wrote the reviews nor do I mean to say that I'm better at the game than them. I'm probably not. What I mean to say is that those reviews are very divorced from my experience with the game, so much so that I felt compelled to speak up.

I've played a lot of roguelite/like deckbuilders. It's my favorite genre. I used to play digital card games competitively. I have and currently do play TCGs competitively. My home collection of board games largely consists of deckbuilders and LCGs. If it's a card game, I want to play it. This is the best deckbuilder I've played since Slay the Spire and Roguebook. It's freakin' phenomenal. Now, I'm not going to talk about the art, theme, ambiance, soundtrack, etc. Those things speak for themselves and they're great. The negative reviews seem aimed at the difficulty, so I'm going to address the elephant in the room.

Yes, this game is tough. Yes, you will die. Yes, you will lose runs. If I wanted a guaranteed win, I have enough games in my library that offer a ""story"" mode. I choose to play roguelite deckbuilders because they're challenging and feel rewarding to beat. I think that's a big draw for most of us that follow this genre. I realize that I may take that to more of an extreme than most players. My next favorite genre are souls-like games, and I always play games on their hardest difficulty. I don't think you need to be like that to enjoy this game. However, if you are like me, then I think you'll really appreciate the challenge this game has to offer.

Is this game ""too"" tough? No, absolutely not. First off, I've aggressively played the first run a dozen times by deleting my save file and restarting. I do that with nearly every game that I play. I died many times. Every single time I died, I could articulate the exact reason why. It always felt like the loss was a direct consequence of my choice. I never once felt oppressed. Did I get frustrated? Sure. Learning can be frustrating sometimes. That's okay. But I did learn, and I did figure it out. Those mistakes taught me how to be better at the game. But did I eventually win? Yes, several times. Since winning that first run, I've only lost one run. The first run has several scripted elements that you can take advantage of to improve your win chances dramatically. I found them, and I feel VERY good about my win chances now. For those writing reviews about the difficulty of the game, if you cannot articulate the scripted elements of the first run, then I encourage to start over. I think you'll really appreciate them when you find them.

What about after the first run? I've won those too. I have consecutive wins on the same playthrough, and I still feel very good about my changes moving forward. Those consecutive runs have only gotten more fun and more interesting. There's lot of content to unlock, and I can't wait to enjoy it all. I think you'll find that there are worthwhile elements to unlock between runs.

What are some things I learned:
- Wildfrost rewards methodical play with versatile deckbuilding rather than decks that abuse a particular interaction.
- This is not a deckbuilder where you can start completing runs in 15 minutes. Your first win will probably take you over an hour. Some encounters will last a minutes or two. Some will last 15 to 20. You may need to take your time and that's okay.
- Wildfrost is not like many other deckbuilders. The cooldown counters will play with your brain for awhile until you acclimate to them. Slay the Spire trains you to thing in terms of ""them then me"". In Wildfrost, every character has a different rate at which they attack. You may have to track the separate cooldowns of up to 12 characters simultaneously in the harder encounters. I think that's been the hardest part of the game.
- You need to make use of all of the mechanics the game has to offer, not just the few that come easy.
- Wildfrost really rewards you for leaning into your deck. Don't think in terms of ""how do I win?"". You need to think in terms of ""how does my deck win?""
- In most cases, there are several threats on board. You need to figure out which threats you can mitigate and which you can't. The ones you can't need to be prioritized. In most cases, that's not the boss.
- Cooldown reduction is often a trap.
- Poison is extremely powerful.
- Crowns and charms are busted, and I love them.
- Lastly and most importantly, many of the things I started choosing to improve my chances were not and would not have been my first choice. They are also not the things that I've seen many streamers fall into yet. I learned from playing the game what works better, and it's made me better.

What about some of the things that other reviewers are saying:
- Will I die in my first encounter? Maybe. But that's a ridiculous notion to me.
- What if my leader has a 7 turn cooldown with no ability? Pick a different one. You get three to choose from.
- Are the encounters (like the fire one) oppressive? No. In my runs, my deck has been the oppressive one.
- Does the game punish you for dragging out encounters? No. I consistently win by dragging out the encounter. More of my encounters wins (especially those against bosses) have been about outlasting the enemies.
- Aren't you just setting yourself for a harder next run? Sure. But I've beaten those too.
- Is the charms mod for enemies ridiculous? I found it to be a fun take on the threat imposed by enemies, and I enjoy it. I always play with it on.
- Is there a ton of balancing that needs to be down before this game is playable? I don't think so.
- Is this game worth it's price tag? Absolutely.

Is there room for improvement? Absolutely.
- In game glossaries of keywords and interactions
- Better visual queues to highlight attack patterns
- Balancing bells to leave room for growth in daily runs
- Making summoned allies/enemies less abusive (players summon these btw)
- Rebalancing support characters like Pyra to make them more playable

I'm sure there are others I'm not thinking of, but I can play around all of them. They do not detract from my opportunity to have a great time playing this game. And the devs are already posted that they're going through a balancing and polishing phase first before moving to new content.

It was definitely a bit short (it took me just short of 11 hours to beat it with a good amount of extra exploration), but I found it was well worth the $20 I paid. The combat felt rewarding, especially dashing in and out to land hits with my greatsword and/or shotgun, although some enemies were a bit of a pain to fight. Also, while I never found any boss to be overly difficult, they all gave a decent enough challenge to be enjoyable, and they often had really great designs. I did notice a few odd performance/design issues, such as the music abruptly cutting at screen transitions or when resting at crow statues, and the hitboxes do occasionally seem a bit weird, but nothing seemed too bad. Enemies also respawn in most rooms upon re-entering, and I got hit once or twice upon entering a room, which isn't the best, but it wasn't terrible or frequent either.

Combat is as slow as watching grass grow, it feels as if the last 10 years of TRPGs didn't happen or the developers lived under a rock during all that time. But for me, the biggest offender, is the lack of consistency in the world's mechanics.

Stole an apple in this farm? Guess what, the rest of the ENTIRE province now suspects you... for some reason.
See these two boars there? Guess what! They become 7 when you enter combat!
See this battle where you can take sides? Yes, each side has 6 warriors according to the screen! But guess what! When you choose a side and fight the other, your side only get's 2 ally soldiers and the other side gets 7!! 
Oh, I see you have a warband of soldiers? Guess what! This group of 3 peasants can kill them with pitchforks!
See that group of refugees with a horse pulling on a cart? Guess what! You beat them and you get not the horse nor the cart!!


This type of game needs to follow consistent mechanics and visuals to provide the player with realistic important information, information that makes them do the best thing, not trick them into spending materials and medicine curing the warband with little to no gain from fighting 3 peasants armed with sticks and pitchforks, or having the entire province know that they are criminals immediately after taking an apple out of a barrel in some backwater shed...

While the inspiration from those games is definitely felt, Photon Engineer definitely distinguishes itself and presents a unique and engaging first-person puzzle experience. The setting and style of the game pops with a spacy color palette almost reminiscent of No Man’s Sky. The music choice is pleasing, ranging from peppy to soothing. The overarching plot narrative might be a tad weak, but that only serves as a backdrop for what really matters: the puzzles. There’s something deeply satisfying about freely floating around a puzzle room deciding where to place your precious few mirrors to solve a laser reflection puzzle that doesn’t quite seem to add up. When you do find the solution however, the satisfaction of that “aha” moment is so worth it. Some of the solutions I’ve discovered so far were hard-won but very clever – they always make sense in retrospect, and I’ve yet to come across a solution that felt “unfair.” The laser puzzles are broken up with some sliding tile puzzles as well, which can be deceptively devious for their simple appearances. The two styles of puzzles are staggered such that neither one will become stale or leave you fatigued. The pacing and teaching (environmentally, mostly) in the game is quite good, with only a couple of instances leaving me scratching my head about a game mechanic (an issue that the dev is actively improving). But overall Photon Engineer has been a very satisfying adventure and a substantial brain workout for me. I’m about 16 rooms deep in the game so far, and I’m looking forward to seeing where it goes from here!",1.0

If you have seen Vail VR its not as sweaty as that and with better gunplay but this game is more sweaty than the other shooters I mentioned previously. It is the right balance of fun but challenging. Yes as the other reviews mention it is full of quest kids and it can be really annoying, but that isn't an inherent problem with the game itself, rather the audience.

Game starts off pretty hard but once you get a few key level ups, you can start chewing through enemies with your cooldown based abilities. I am incredibly impressed with how unique each character is and how varied their individual playstyles are. This game is a rogue-lite technically but each (winning) run will take well over 10 hours, probably closer to the 15-20 hours for your first run.

I cannot stress enough just how FUN this game is and how much I've fallen in love with it. Its genuinely an improvement on the games that it gathered so much inspiration from. This game tries to do so much and succeeds on almost every point, you can clearly see the passion behind this title and the audience really does benefit from it. This is the easiest recommend that I have had in years.

Despite all my praise, there are three [i] small [/i] gripes I have with this game:
[*]  the XCOM Fog of War pod aggro system. If you move one tile too far you can pretty much be ambushed by enemies you're very much not ready for. Can slow the pace of the game significantly on certain maps.

[*]  no undo button for non-chance related actions. You overwatched someone and then realized 5 seconds later a much better use of their turn? Too bad, overwatch can't be de-activated even though it hasn't really taken effect yet.

[*]  there's an upgrade that gives you the ability to give an action to any character once per map ...except you can't use that ability on characters that have no remaining actions. For an ability that's once per map, it feels really bad to pre-emptively pop that once per map action on someone just in case they miss their 85% shot. Should have the option to provide that action to anyone, regardless of their current remaining actions.",1.0

[b]Runs perfectly on the steam deck, which I think is the best platform for this title.[/b]

Overall, the collection is overpriced considering anyone can run all of these games (often with netplay features and trading included) for the price of free if you have the most up to date graphing calculator. That being said, the games are still solid and presenting them in a complete package with all the extra download & patch cards does save a bit of time and setup headaches for dedicated fans. No issues performance-wise on multiple platforms, cloud saving is very nice. The home screen with animated megaman is pretty cool and his cliche voice lines are fun. The art and music galleries are very welcome inclusion since this series has some of the best of both on the GBA imo. 

The biggest gripe I have is with the piss poor presentation of the actual game window and borders when playing the game. The screen resolution of the gba makes for a very clunky transition to modern displays, and it looks like exactly 0 effort was spent trying to make it look even close to decent. The border images don't line up with the game window at all on any setting - and to that point, why isn't there an option to just disable the border image and blow the game up to near fullscreen? There's a pretty solid pixel filter, so why not use it? Why aren't there CRT filter effects or simulated ghosting to make the game more visually appealing and nostalgically accurate?

Would've loved to see a bit more effort put into possibly my favorite series on the gba, but oh well. 6/10 buy it on sale if you're inclined but your best bet is to just find alternative ways to play the game.",1.0

Tutorial's bare bones but frankly it has its purpose made clear, figured it out after a while, weapons can be found in ? Point of interests while ! Are boss locations. Bosses and ??? Will respawn.

Currently two bosses in the game, Riot and Queen 'Zumbie' 

Each boss you kill unlocks a weapon of respective tier for future use at the start of a round, i.e starting off with a tier 2 gun instead of using literally nothing. 

Game needs polish, it's an alpha, bosses can range anywhere from 'Can cheese with a corner' to ""Moderately difficult if fought head on.'

[spoiler]The Riot zombie can be cheesed by kiting it after phase 1, it's got a maximum range for its shotgun attacks, so just kite out of range, Queen Zombie can literally be cheesed by hiding in the stairs and peeking out to take shots.[/spoiler]

Game overall isn't horrible, pretty alright for an alpha release.

Only downside i've really seen from my own experience and other reviews, melee can be a little underwhelming and zombies can be unrelenting, unless you kite through several buildings I've had a boss zombie literally follow me halfway across the map. Aggro is unlimited from what I can tell.

2997,136844347.0,1797630,"Let's be clear, this not an awful game. It just fell short of what it could be. While the demo promised a mother-like rpg with poker instead of combat, the game feels more linear than I would have imagined. I'm a few hours in so far and am disappointed but overall enjoy the game. It's gotten a lot of Visual Novel comparison mostly because it's kind of like danganropa, but also because of its linearity and heavy diialogue.

The Dialogue is decent though overall and if you accept it for what it is you'll have a good time, but there are problems. For one, the poker is too easy, it may get harder later but it definitely leans into accessibility for everyone rather than lending itself to people who love poker. That being said, it totally is too niche for people who don't like poker. If you want to fight bat's in caves, this game will not scratch the itch.

The non poker games are fun, but the character says it himself, something like ""I came here to play poker, not lose money"". Poker naturally lends itself to grinding through difficult and tight situations to get better and play against better opponents, this game decided instead to use poker in lieu of combat. They could be playing chess, the poker part is mostly irrelevant when it comes to the storyline

It all feels so over the top, like the cool magician poker rpg spiraled into something else which is fun but ultimately not the poker rpg I was hoping for. Its hard to recommend this to either people who want a poker game or people who want an rpg, but if you don't mind that it doesn't do either as well as it could, then this might work for you. I think there is potential for greatness and I wish the dev success in their future games.",0.0

Only downside is that at this time there is no party systems so grouping with friends can be annoying at times. You will have better luck just making a private server and waiting for it to populate.

Feedback to the Devs - You've gotten everything right, for sustainability on a VR platform you will have to push constant updates even if Minor. Try to focus on the optimization first as lag will turn people away from a VR title. Eventually adding a player/community map system will benefit you, even if it is a voted through process from your team. Until then I would try to add in more maps as 3 or 4 maps at launch will get stale fast. Besides that keep up the hard work! Love this game.",1.0

The gun play is also great and I wouldn't change much, some balancing is needed which the devs have already noted. 

Tarkov ruined all FPS games for me and this is the first fps game I have enjoyed in years. 

A lot of people are not sold on the audio it certainly feels strange to start with but I soon grew to love it as we have all got so used to the overwhelming audio in most games now.

Spawns need a bit of work but this has also already been noted by the devs and the interaction and updates from the devs at launch has been really good and fills me with some confidence this game will only get better.

Other things to note are the UI could do with some work and region lock could do with being added. But the foundation for this game is really strong and unique if they can keep supporting it and polishing it, this will be Gem.

3026,136632296.0,1694740,"I hate to have to give this a negative review, but the controls are not proper in my opinion. Instead of thrust, WASD allows you to ""dodge"". Oddly, you have to hold down shift in order to thrust. This was unwieldy, so I changed thrust to W and just let that evasion direction go. But without reverse thrust, it's still too difficult to properly maneuver. I'm far from bad at video games, but with this kind of control scheme, I found it fairly impossible to beat even the second stage boss.

Maybe the controls are such that you're meant to use the dodge buttons exclusively in combat, but the game doesn't make this clear and I'm not sure if that would work better. And also, that's not really how ""dodge"" is supposed to be used.

That being said, I do like the other aspects. I like how the mining probes work, and the mechanics to force you to leave a sector after a certain time. I like the upgrade system too.

This game is good. I experienced a bit of the demo and I'm at nearly 6 hours of play - I beat my first run a couple hours ago, and I'm really impressed with how unique the game is. There's elements of Monster Train and Spire in this, with an especially interesting counter system that counts down to unit actions. There's a ton of room for depth, and what's here is challenging, fun, and (perhaps most importantly with so many roguelike deckbuilders out there) distinctive.

Negative reviews are complaining about the difficulty, for the most part (lots of curious eyes turned toward the ""balancing""). I have yet to explore the full depth of the game, but there's nothing about the mechanics that feel especially broken or unfair. There's a bit of a knowledge game to be played early on, where you'll have to familiarize yourself with the different kinds of enemies the game can throw at you, but this is nothing new if you've played deckbuilders. Having to think about how your deck fares against different enemy builds encourages planning and being critical of your deck's needs, and the combo-kill system adds incentive to be creative and thoughtful even in the early/easy fights.

The art style might make some folks think this is supposed to be a cute and easy game (it is cute!). It's definitely not easy. Making the most of the game's many challenging situations is something I'm looking forward to in future playthroughs, and if anything changes I may visit this review with an update.

The enemies are cool with good variety in types. Fun story.

Some criticism is that the game is rather easy, I do play a lot of turn-based strategy games but even still, I think if you're new to the genre, you'll quickly find this game easy as well, so maybe start the game on hard (which feels like it should be normal to me). Some abilities are pretty OP, the katana combo for example or the heavy's 6 free weapon blasts, the game quickly snowballs into a rat slaughterfest.

3049,136856614.0,1183800,"This game hooked me right from the start.

I love the graphic style and all the detailed touches in each level.  I'm a big fan of games like XCOM and Darkest Dungeon and this game has successfully blended elements of the two.

In between combat missions is a DD-like ""camping"" scenario where you get to select various buffs and actions that can heal or prepare characters for the upcoming combat.  It is a short but effective way to gear up and get to the next combat mission. Choices matter during this preparation step (especially before you unlock the power up that gives more actions).

Combat is solid and similar to cover mechanics from other turn based games (like XCOM).  Each character feels unique and managing their strengths (and weaknesses) in battle is key for success. I'm only 8 hours into the game so far on my first playthrough but it has been a joy seeing characters take shape as they level up.  Gideon is my fave so far (I love me some sniper overwatch)

I am the type of gamer who will delay starting a new game for fear of a large learning curve up front, but this game got me up to speed quickly with a solid tutorial mission (and compendium).

I love the scenery, i love the idea of the robot creatures, and being able to explore through ruins... but what is it all for? there is no story (and never will be). there is no reasoning for any of it. 
yes you can build - with a very limited toolset but its still possible. you can craft some things. sure. u can scan robots so you can make it yourself and arm them with a couple of guns. they dont do anything but still. There are different biomes to allow you to upgrade your robots to stronger versions with some materials. There is alot of possibility.

BUT

the dev says its content complete.. that there is 50hrs of content. got to 30hrs and already in the last biome. there is no point to scanning the robots because they dont do anything worth while other than to ride. U cant control their shooting when u do put guns on them, they dont harvest anything and there are alot of still frustrating bugs around the robots. 
This game is PLAYABLE.. but not enjoyable IMO. All you do is build, scan dinos for recipes and patterns and for armour you cant even use yet (not implemented yet. considering that its ""there"" i assume it will be?)
The dev states that there will be no more major updates to the game, but yet there is nothing to the armour.. 

There is no story line - dont expect one
There is no end game - Claims there is bosses but still havent found them after opening up the whole map
There is nothing new being added apparently. 
When suggestions are made in the community they are shot down because its not his view of the game. If you just wanted to make a game for yourself then dont publish it. or at least dont charge a stupid amount for such a lacking game. Listed to your community! There is a way to create a game and make a good portion of ur community happy (u will never satisfy everyone - but ur not even satisfying ANYONE that makes suggestions.). Sad part is alot of the suggestions are the same thing and yet it still gets brushed off.. things as simple as map markers (what is implemented is hardly ""map markers"". u dont even know where ur team mates are), Ark had more than this did at its release... THIS game has more potential with a dev that has the ability but no care for the game it seems...

AT LEAST ALLOW FOR WORKSHOP CONTENT BY OTHER PEOPLE!!! then all their bitching of what they want they can make in the workshop for your game and u never have to listen to it again.. its such a shame...

It has SO much potential.. but without a dev that cares.. it wont make squat on what it possibly could.. 

I see this as a dead game and just a money grab for the dev to ""fund"" the 2 other games he is working on.

There's a lot of emphasis on player choice, especially mechanically. The story is fairly linear as of Day 2, but even that has its fair share of decisions that I won't spoil.
The setpieces and UI are nice and smooth, and the band never seems to run out of bangers to play (with some charming lyrics set the rhythm, in text box form). 
But half the time, it'll just crash after an encounter. It's a mild inconvenience since it's remembered the end result each time, and I haven't lost any progress due to this bug. The polish is otherwise top notch.

Pros:
1. Feels much more polished compared to some other VR titles.
2. Game play is fun and engaging.
3. It feels great to get a good group on comms creating a game plan for each round
4. Servers are plentiful and lots of people in them (at least for now).
5. Maps are fun.


Cons:
1. Gun balance I think still could use some work.  It feels like there is no point in using either the free pistol of cyclone; maybe just my lack of experience but it seems to hold true for many others.
2. I feel like 3 S&D and 1 TDM maps is limiting. 
3. Graphics are OKAY.. I mean we are close to CS:GO level.. maybe?  It doesn't look as good as Pavlov imho but.. I do think they focused on making this game run flawlessly.

I beat it in about 2.5 hours, its pretty linear but the level design is functional with some highlights and the art design is pretty strong overall. Scares are OK for the most part, the atmosphere in the first half is strong although there are a few lazy jump scares.
My only major criticism is that the killer AI could use some work in a certain scene to make it feel a bit more tense. Due to the length of said scene, the limitations of the AI become very evident - limiting the overall tension factor.
I would also have liked to see some explanation of the killer's backstory and motives as whilst he has a strong design, he seems very 2D.

3123,136851903.0,"1798010,1798020","Out of all the “baby’s first RPG” titles I’ve played as a child, this is the only series that’s kept me coming back. You play as a schoolboy named Lan, who sends Mega Man into the internet or local networks (dungeons) through various electronic devices where most of the meaningful gameplay happens. You go through simple isometric mazes and solve basic puzzles, pick up cash and items, and get hounded by random encounters. There’s a lot of fetch quests, repetition and archaic RPG design that may turn off a lot of people. None of that matters because Battle Network has peak Action RPG combat.

Combat is a combination of card game and action game where you dodge enemy attacks by moving on a 3x3 grid, while the enemies do the same on another 3x3 grid. You can pick at enemies with your infinite-use Mega Buster but most of your damage will come from using cards (battlechips) with various uses, from simple projectiles to functions like icing the entire stage. You start off being able to draw so many chips and every few seconds you’re able to pause the game to draw some more. Pausing constantly in an action game is usually a bad thing, but here it’s good as it lets you formulate a strategy in the chaos. Enemies have predicable attack patterns, you may think “This guy is gonna jump around twice more and then stop to shoot me, I’ll use this air chip to push him into same row as his friend, and then take them both out at once with this bomb chip!”, things may go awry and then you’ll have to improvise a new plan. As with any card game, your starting hand is randomly selected from the cards you put in your deck, this keeps encounters fresh since you’ll be readjusting on how to best deal with the enemy with whatever you’re dealt. Good deckbuilding is making sure you will never end up with a hand that’s unusable. Skillful play is directly rewarded, your combat speed/efficacy is graded and gives you better rewards at the end of combat the better you do, giving you either more money or chips. You don’t really level up traditionally, but cash is usually handy and chips are you main source of power. Even trash chips are welcome as you can use them to roll on a chip trader, which can give you basically any chip from more garbage to absurdly broken things you would otherwise need to S rank endgame level bosses for. In short, combat is fast, easy-to-understand and has a surprising amount of depth and customization for how simple it looks. Despite the problems these games have with content and balance, I would say the skeleton of this gameplay is basically perfect, and the best successor to Battle Network has cloned these fundamentals 1-to-1. Here’s a rundown of the games themselves.

Battle Network 1: The start of it all. The combat isn’t as good as its sequels but it still has the core of what makes BN combat fun. Unfortunately the game is very rough in typical first-game fashion. It’s short and the mechanics aren’t well developed. The encounter rate is insane. The overworld is a barely-navigable mess with a single tileset and it has one of the worst dungeons ever made. I wouldn’t say you should skip the game without trying it, but if you start getting frustrated with fumbling around in the dark there’s not much shame in going ahead to a much better game.

Battle Network 2: The typical Mega Man sequel where the devs nail it. The game is longer and much more polished. There’s more than one visual theme in the overworld, so it’s possible to navigate now. The combat/deckbuilding mechanics are much better and there’s a new style system where the game buffs you based on your playstyle. For example if you draw a lot of chips you’ll get the Custom style which lets you start a fight with more potential chips to draw, if you use the buster a lot you’ll get the Guts style which buffs the buster. Unfortunately it can be grindy, if you somehow end up with a style you don’t like you’ll have to fight 200+ battles to get another one. You can level up styles by fighting battles, but all it does is strengthen your charge shot. Styles are still a positive addition, giving a lot of customization and depth. BN2 also starts the series’ tendency towards surprisingly extensive post-game content. There’s a lot of collecting/grinding involved if you want to do all of it, but entire areas, sidequests and unique bosses for expert players are only found after the credits roll. This is welcome, especially when a lot of RPGs are still content with giving you one superboss, if anything at all. One problem that will stick with the series is there’s a decent amount of padding added, BN2 adds a lot of mundane fetch quests going back and forth across previously explored internet areas. One such section is atrociously bad, but for the others I’m not gonna complain too much when the game asks me to engage in more combat. All-in-all this is a great game and a big improvement over its predecessor.

Battle Network 3: BN3 takes BN2 and expands it even more. There’s a greater variety of chips, enemies and bosses. There’s a new “NaviCust” system where you place blocks (programs) down a grid to give Mega Man various benefits like a stronger buster or the ability to survive a fatal hit with 1 HP. It’s basically inventory Tetris but with your stats and I wish more games had something like it. They weren’t too sure how to implement it here though, as several parts of the internet/main quest require equipping a program to progress, forcing you to constantly swap out programs or gimp yourself by leaving on something that’s otherwise useless. Styles are back and leveling them up gives you programs for the NaviCust, so you’re encouraged to branch out instead of just sticking with one you like. BN3 is the longest in the series, but there’s also even more padding than 2, which can be grating. On the other hand, BN3 also has an insane amount of postgame content, some say it’s the second half of the game and they’re probably right. If the game were made today content of this size would be paid DLC but it’s just included in the game already, accessible only to the most dedicated players. Times have certainly changed. Unfortunately what has been consistent is Capcom’s love of scummy business practices, this is the first game in the series to have two versions ala Pokemon. Thankfully its not too bad and they’re both in Vol 1. There’s a few chips and one style exclusive to each version, Blue is a bit more favorable due to having an extra boss but otherwise you can pick your favorite color between the two. Despite its problems, BN3 is excellent and one of the best games in the GBA’s library.

I didn’t mention the story, it doesn’t matter at all. It’s episodic children's anime stuff about as meaningful as a classic Mega Man plot, but with more yelling about friendship and hearts. It’s kinda fun thinking about how insane this world and its events are. The first dungeon in the series is a program forcing an oven to spit fire. It’s weirdly prophetic as well, considering how many of the scenarios are about bad guys hacking devices that shouldn’t have been made with any internet access to begin with. But if you want Deus Ex you should look elsewhere.

For what the collection adds, you get Mega Man talking to you on the game select menu, far from necessary but it’s nice. There’s typical extras like art galleries, trophies and a music player. The music is surprisingly good for GBA games, it’s like the system’s audio capabilities were made to make bubbly techno sound good and nothing else. You can import Japanese event exclusive chips which have been basically inaccessible by official means up until now. There’s also online PVP and chip trading to help you collect them all, definitely beats a link cable.

So for Volume 1 you get a rough prototype of a game and two great games. There’s a lot of stuff here, especially if you do post game content. I’d say it’s worth it even at its base price if you value excellent combat above all else.",1.0

This indie horror game is just 1$, but I can't say it's offering more than the price reflects. The game's graphics are nice, but that's about it with this game, the atmosphere is really lacking something to make it scarier and more immersive. Its gameplay is not that fun either because you only have to go from room to room to find the key for the next room (I think I've used the camera or something other than the keys to open one door but the game does not tell you much so I don't know exactly what I did lol). There is only 1 enemy in this game and it seems that it does not follow you everywhere (just on the floor you spawn) and when it catches you, you take damage from him but he does not move at all while attacking you lol. This game really does need some work but it is really cheap and for just 1$ you can support an indie dev and his work.

There isn't even combat in the game yet and i'd rather spend hours building in Fabledom, than play the atrocity that is ""New Allies"", which has combat. 
The graphics are beautiful yet simplistic, game play incredibly smooth, the Prince and Princess mechanic i find to be amazingly unique, you guys really did create something beautiful here. 

The amount of content already in the game as a ""early access"", is incredible and I'm very excited to see what future updates/changes will bring!!!! 

I highly recommend this game to everyone!!!

This game is a pristine, immaculate, Diamond among the rough pebbles, please give this game a try!!!",1.0

3148,136821416.0,1649740,"Thoroughly enjoyed this game; its the first game I've been engaged enough with to try and beat in one sitting (it took two). Gorgeous pixel art, interesting lore/worldbuilding, solid combat, unique and challenging bosses. There are enough different weapons/abilities and enough variety of environments/enemies that I actually felt compelled to try different options, which doesn't always happen for me in these types of games.  I've seen a few negative reviews that dislike the feel of the combat, but to each their own, I suppose. Overall, if you're searching for a minimalist 2D indie Bloodborne, or something that feels a bit like a very challenging Link to the Past, Hunt the Night may be worth checking out.",1.0

It is not easy. You have to reach the entrance of the bunker with 4 chars and a robot. You have 10 different people to chose and 3 different type of robots. Therefore you can find a party that suits you well and also there is room to replay the game. 
There are party skills, people skills and different possibilities to upgrade your weapons. 
Achievements give you points to unlock skills.
The game is not expensive is quite cheap compared with the game content and with other game prices.

1. Asia needs a region lock. I only queue US servers, and in most games I am the only player with ping below 50.
2. Joining dead servers.  I just played 5 games this morning on US servers.  I was only put into low player count lobbies, with less than 4 total people in the game.

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Is it wrong to repay the debt in a dungeon? is a Unity based deck builder card game.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You play as Akane. Your father, Dinard, borrowed a large sum of money. The first two years the interest on the loan was only .0001%, the third year the interest increased to 100% of the principal per month. Fortunately Akane is a Knight in training and a labyrinth has appeared recently and needs to be cleared. The Adventurer's Guild is paying good money to clear the labyrinth.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
This game requires a patch from OTAKU Plan to unlock the adult content. The patch is an executable stored on a Google drive. The executable finds where you have the game installed, I have my games installed in a non-standard location and it had no issue locating it. You can tell if the patch is installed if you see breasts on the title menu. Without the patch there is no nudity and the brothel is not available.

After you get the introduction you head into the labyrinth. Your first trip to the labyrinth is a cake walk. You only have Normal Attack, Defense, and All-Out Attack as your cards. You have three action points per round. There is a symbol over the monster's head as to what they are going to do on their turn. Don't bother with defense if they are not attacking. You are told you can come back the next day to attempt the next level. When you come back you are informed that you can take jobs from the Adventurer's Guild bulletin board and that the jobs you will be able to accept will depend on your level. You are also told of The Lang Shop where you can purchase tools and equipment for the labyrinth. Another option, the Brothel, is mentioned as a third way to earn money. You are given a letter of introduction for the Brothel. After visiting all of the locations you will unlock the status screen where you can select what you want to do.

If you skip the introduction, this is where you will end up. At the map selection screen. The game can be completed in a number of different ways. You can work in the Brothel, as long as you keep your lust down. Most of the scenes are from the brothel. You can do quests from the Adventurer's Guild Bulletin Board. Failed quests are another source of scenes. Failing a quest usually means picking a specific option, and that option isn't obvious. You can kill monsters in the Labyrinth, which is how the game is designed to be played.

There are different phases to the game. Each phase requires you pay the Baron a certain amount of money in a certain time frame. You can ask for an extension, another source of scenes. 

As you enter the Labrinth you may need to select from one or two options. If there is only one option, that is what you have to select. If there are two options you can select the one you want. Frequently encountered options are: Normal or Strong monsters, Chest or Mana Spring, Mana Spring or Strong monster. The Chests contents are similar to what you will encounter when you win a battle. The Mana Spring has three options: Large Heal, Medium Heal with some Magic Stones, Lots of Magic Stones. I frequently ran into Spring were there were no Magic Stones so it was bast to pick the Large Heal. Fights in the Labrinth are one to three monsters. After you successfully complete each battle you will get to choose a reward. This reward can be Magic Stones (Traded in town automatically for gold), Mana, Cards, and Rainbow Crystals.

You can fail up to three fights. When you fail you lose half of your Magic Stones. If you don't think you're going to win the next fight you can go back to town and you will only lose 30% of your Magic Stones (and keep your number of fight losses available the same).

Back in town you can upgrade your cards at the Order of Knights with Mana and Rainbow Crystals. You can purchase consumables (a waste of money in my book) and equipment from the Shop. The Arena can be used to raise your stats. If you completed a dungeon you can pick up your reward at the Adventurer's Guild, along with quests if you desire. You can also work in the Brothel if things aren't going well.

While the images for the scenes are mainly static stills there is audio that goes with them. ;)

Frequently the spacing in the text is off, normally following punctuation like ' and "". While I understand the text in the scenes not being spaced properly, it is a bit distracting for the regular text.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
There are 27 scenes in the gallery. There is an unlock all button if you don't want to try to find them all. The scenes play exactly like they do in the game.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
A good card game on its own. Adult content available only with patch from OTAKU Plan's website.

- Ranking needs to be added faster than 1.0 release, because we don't know what the release date is and waiting for a long ass time could possibly make the game die. 

- We definately need a global leaderboard which shows the top players around the globe, statistically wise such as Top KD, Top Kills, most deaths etc. 

- There definately has to be added a description of what each items does, because there's literally nothing that describes an ability otherwise than just the name of it. 

",1.0
3209,136798987.0,1364020,"After nearly 9 hours playing this game I feel its time to review.

Lets start with the pros.

Graphics and visuals 10/10.
Gun play takes me back to Cod BO2 clean, precise and balanced.
Movement is on point it takes a little getting use to but when you figure it out its truly unique.
Progression is an enjoyable experience and does not feel like a chore (Looking at you MW2.0)
Maps are good fun and a nice balance with some really big maps and some smaller maps as well
loads of choice with how you want to play the maps!

Now for some cons

It does not default you to a region so expect some high ping player you can select a region but some do not or clearly don't want to so you often find a high ping player with a name not written in letters.
The waiting time for the match to start needs halving as its far to long it does jump down when are all players are ready but most of the time there is someone who has not readied up.
Half time is back on Domination ( I love its back but some will hate it i feel its a con more than a pro also that timer needs removing ;D)
You aim at people to tag them its a good feature the con is the XP it gives you that shows up right where the kill confirmed XP shows often leading to you thinking you've killed someone who was only marked.

So after sharing what IMO is the pros and cons of the game I would say with the current state of the game and the price its selling at that its 100% worth getting this game its EA its already being patched and its already better than a lot of other shooters out there in a few months time we could have a really solid shooter set to last for a while so take the leap and pick your copy up today.

3217,136800887.0,1797630,"Great game. I really liked the characters, story, music, and the concept behind the game play. I also absolutely love the ending and twists along the way. 

However, sometimes the players don't make very sound decisions, and using certain abilities exploitatively will guarantee you a win. The game eliminates the person with the least amount of chips after a certain amount of hands, and the last one standing wins. You can use this to your advantage and just fold every hand while you have the chip lead to secure a win as well. Your opponents won't do this so you'll still have a chance sometimes when facing a deficit. With changes to some of the abilities and the opponents actions, I think this game could be a lot better. 

Overall, this game is a blast and is always keeping you in suspense. The poker is fun if you don't take it too seriously, but it could definitely use some improvements. I recommend you give it a try!",1.0

3234,136803783.0,1183800,"Brilliant squad based tactical game with a charming Steampunk aesthetic that I think any fan of X-COM/Xenonauts and any other similar game might want to at least give a cursory glance.

The constant choice between either making for the exit or chancing another turn to get that final bit of loot (that could turn out to be nothing) does wonders for keeping tension high. The game is hard but I wouldn't say it's unfair, mistakes are punished but I haven't (yet) been in any kind of situation where a wrong move has cost me the game and you quickly learn to take your time and move tactically.

That said, there have been a couple of occasions where I've accidentally moved a character into a horribly compromised position without intending to, with no way to undo it which has almost needlessly cost me a squad member's life and has needlessly cost me precious resources to heal them; I think the game might benefit by at least being able to undo a character move (though I would perhaps only have you be able to do so as long as the enemy pod is already in combat and only before any other actions are taken after said move), but since it lacks such a feature at the moment, I'd advise great care where you move your people to!

Plenty of stuff to unlock and add to your game, including what looks to be a wonderful roster of characters who all seem to bring their own unique twist to your squad (I say looks to be as I've only unlocked two of them at the time of this review and so far only rescued one. Yes you have to save them from the rats after unlocking them to recruit them, another cool little feature I think!), and a cool assortment of upgrades to add to your weapons.

Small side note: the upgrades also change the look of the weapon itself, a small aesthetic feature that I've always appreciated in games.

For the asking price I don't think it's worth being without this game in your library if you're even remotely interested in these kind of games, just give it a shot!",1.0

3241,136811268.0,2328760,"The ultimate pinball game has finally arrived at Steam. Do I recommend it? Oh yeah, without a doubt. There's some old tables remastered and some new ones. Some of them are awesome, the others frustrating, but overall great. I like diversity.
Let's first talk about the elephant in the room. There's a lot of reviewers saying they should get the tables for free. I'm really baffled by that. I've never got any game for free. If I wanted a remastered version of the game I had to bought it. You usually get a loyalty discount, like it's the case here, but that's about it. The price tag is high if you want to buy all of them at once, but it's about 3 euros per table which I think it's reasonable. And of course I've bought the whole thing. I know I'm going to sink hundreds of hours into it, so it was a no brainer for me. I've made a mistake only once and I'm still salty about it. Back when Pinball FX2 was out I didn't know I won't be able to buy the rest of the tables after certain date. I would be happy to buy the tables I'm missing, to complete my collection, even though I have all the missing ones in FX3. *Please ZEN unlock that option just for a day :)
The game runs smooth. The physics is quite different, so it will take some time to get used to. Some tables are easier in the old game (the ball is really bouncy on some of the tables here), the others in the new version (I've found Williams tables in particular way easier now), but it's fun to learn new stuff.
Also if you're on the fence, if you should buy the game or not, you actually have every table unlocked for the 24 hours when you first start the game (I think only Marvel tables were on time trial for me). Definitely try before you buy, so you won't regret it. I think that's a great move by the developers.
Now let's talk about the cons. There's one thing that I personaly don't like and that's the achievements. I know I'm probably alone on this one, but I really miss those. There are only 10 general Steam achievements now. You'll unlock 8 of them about 15 minutes after starting the game and leave the other 2 unlocked forever.  But that's not the biggest problem I have with it. Pinball FX2 and Pinball FX3 had the best trophy mechanics in video games. It was what got me into pinball in the first place and why I've left so many hours on those games. The moment when the whole table suddenly paused and that shiny medal spun into view was the most satisfying thing in gaming. Like defeating an impossible boss that gave you trouble for days and weeks and then you finally conquered it. Now there's just a tiny square among dozens, that pop up during the game. I haven't even noticed it until I saw yellow circles bellow some of the table icons in my library. So I really wish those shiny ones were back. But that's just me ranting.
The game's great! See you on the leaderboards! Cheers!

sThe next are more of suggestions I would like to see, upgradable  production facilities. things like the mining operations and coal generator  would be nice to have levels to upgrade to that boost their production to save space or produce at faster rates. Also control of production rates like reducing something to 50% capacity to save costs while still producing. Trade routes... Open up trading between countries that bring in (money, food, Resources) at a regular interval. This would give the player a since of a saving grace if they begin to fall behind producing or need a little push to get them to the next level/area.

3247,136813201.0,1651560,"It's early. Give the devs a chance. It is early access and you can tell a bit. Yet it is still the game I've spent the most time on lately (other than Dredge).

Summary: This is what the original Serf City / The Settlers franchise should have become.

Initial Thoughts:
* CUTE AS CRAP! It's fun, challenging, and cozy at the same time. Unless 1/2 your people die from starvation while the granaries are full. I just love how it looks.
* While a lot of content hasn't been released yet, I still spent SEVEN HOURS playing it the first time. Wow. Didn't even realize it. I was so engaged.
* It's easy to learn and play. Yet as the mid-game starts really happening it can be challenging not having some of the future building.
* Once you hit a good spot (a few hours in) you can let it ""ant farm"" and run on its own and just see what happens. I love that. Will probably stream that happening.
* Mechanics are similar to other games in the genre, yet seem to really flow much better than others games I've played recently.
* Some events, like The W---- (don't want to spoil anything), just seem super random and nothing you can do about it. I get having random events, but I hope long term that mean more or make more sense than just to cripple you for a time.
* I LOVE the simplicity and actual functionality of the Overview Menu. I do so much in there when my area gets big and has lots of Fablings. Other games have either too little or too much information. I don't want to play Excel. This game really does it nicely.

Little Annoyances (There are a few annoying things I'd love to see the devs adjust. And I did send feedback on these. Keep in mind this is early access... just some ideas.):
* The blue road placement icons look exactly like their water indicator. For HOURS I thought that's what they were. Please make them distinctive.
* I'd love to see the road placement indicators AFTER buildings are built too. Like when you click on them. It can help with planning and adjusting as your village evolves.
* Fablings can go up hills, but you can't put roads on hills. Seems odd. Would like that to change.
* Hoping that in the future they can get water from other sources than wells (rivers, springs).
* The UI is big. I'd love being able to adjust the UI elements (like the tool bars and such) as other games in the genre let you. And option to hide it for recording (I LOVE just watching the Fablings). I have an ultra-wide giant monitor and it is still super annoying in the long game.
* A few times zoom got stuck for me. I'd zoom out and it would just zoom all the way in. I'd have to restart it to get it to stop.

Overall, this game is great already. I just can't wait to see what it is a year from now. I'm already addicted and am excited to see where the dev team and designers are going to take it.",1.0

3255,136814124.0,1798010,"Out of all the “baby’s first RPG” titles I’ve played as a child, this is the only series that’s kept me coming back. You play as a schoolboy named Lan, who sends Mega Man into the internet or local networks (dungeons) through various electronic devices where most of the meaningful gameplay happens. You go through simple isometric mazes and solve basic puzzles, pick up cash and items, and get hounded by random encounters. There’s a lot of fetch quests, repetition and archaic RPG design that may turn off a lot of people. None of that matters because Battle Network has peak Action RPG combat. 

Combat is a combination of card game and action game where you dodge enemy attacks by moving on a 3x3 grid, while the enemies do the same on another 3x3 grid. You can pick at enemies with your infinite-use Mega Buster but most of your damage will come from using cards (battlechips) with various uses, from simple projectiles to functions like icing the entire stage. You start off being able to draw so many chips and every few seconds you’re able to pause the game to draw some more. Pausing constantly in an action game is usually a bad thing, but here it’s good as it lets you formulate a strategy in the chaos. Enemies have predicable attack patterns, you may think “This guy is gonna jump around twice more and then stop to shoot me, I’ll use this air chip to push him into same row as his friend, and then take them both out at once with this bomb chip!”, things may go awry and then you’ll have to improvise a new plan. As with any card game, your starting hand is randomly selected from the cards you put in your deck, this keeps encounters fresh since you’ll be readjusting on how to best deal with the enemy with whatever you’re dealt. Good deckbuilding is making sure you will never end up with a hand that’s unusable. Skillful play is directly rewarded, your combat speed/efficacy is graded and gives you better rewards at the end of combat the better you do, giving you either more money or chips. You don’t really level up traditionally, but cash is usually handy and chips are you main source of power. Even trash chips are welcome as you can use them to roll on a chip trader, which can give you basically any chip from more garbage to absurdly broken things you would otherwise need to S rank endgame level bosses for. In short, combat is fast, easy-to-understand and has a surprising amount of depth and customization for how simple it looks. Despite the problems these games have with content and balance, I would say the skeleton of this gameplay is basically perfect, and the best successor to Battle Network has cloned these fundamentals 1-to-1. Here’s a rundown of the games themselves.

Battle Network 1: The start of it all. The combat isn’t as good as its sequels but it still has the core of what makes BN combat fun. Unfortunately the game is very rough in typical first-game fashion. It’s short and the mechanics aren’t well developed. The encounter rate is insane. The overworld is a barely-navigable mess with a single tileset and it has one of the worst dungeons ever made. I wouldn’t say you should skip the game without trying it, but if you start getting frustrated with fumbling around in the dark there’s not much shame in going ahead to a much better game.

Battle Network 2: The typical Mega Man sequel where the devs nail it. The game is longer and much more polished. There’s more than one visual theme in the overworld, so it’s possible to navigate now. The combat/deckbuilding mechanics are much better and there’s a new style system where the game buffs you based on your playstyle. For example if you draw a lot of chips you’ll get the Custom style which lets you start a fight with more potential chips to draw, if you use the buster a lot you’ll get the Guts style which buffs the buster. Unfortunately it can be grindy, if you somehow end up with a style you don’t like you’ll have to fight 200+ battles to get another one. You can level up styles by fighting battles, but all it does is strengthen your charge shot. Styles are still a positive addition, giving a lot of customization and depth. BN2 also starts the series’ tendency towards surprisingly extensive post-game content. There’s a lot of collecting/grinding involved if you want to do all of it, but entire areas, sidequests and unique bosses for expert players are only found after the credits roll. This is welcome, especially when a lot of RPGs are still content with giving you one superboss, if anything at all. One problem that will stick with the series is there’s a decent amount of padding added, BN2 adds a lot of mundane fetch quests going back and forth across previously explored internet areas. One such section is atrociously bad, but for the others I’m not gonna complain too much when the game asks me to engage in more combat. All-in-all this is a great game and a big improvement over its predecessor.

Battle Network 3: BN3 takes BN2 and expands it even more. There’s a greater variety of chips, enemies and bosses. There’s a new “NaviCust” system where you place blocks (programs) down a grid to give Mega Man various benefits like a stronger buster or the ability to survive a fatal hit with 1 HP. It’s basically inventory Tetris but with your stats and I wish more games had something like it. They weren’t too sure how to implement it here though, as several parts of the internet/main quest require equipping a program to progress, forcing you to constantly swap out programs or gimp yourself by leaving on something that’s otherwise useless. Styles are back and leveling them up gives you programs for the NaviCust, so you’re encouraged to branch out instead of just sticking with one you like. BN3 is the longest in the series, but there’s also even more padding than 2, which can be grating. On the other hand, BN3 also has an insane amount of postgame content, some say it’s the second half of the game and they’re probably right. If the game were made today content of this size would be paid DLC but it’s just included in the game already, accessible only to the most dedicated players. Times have certainly changed. Unfortunately what has been consistent is Capcom’s love of scummy business practices, this is the first game in the series to have two versions ala Pokemon. Thankfully its not too bad and they’re both in Vol 1. There’s a few chips and one style exclusive to each version, Blue is a bit more favorable due to having an extra boss but otherwise you can pick your favorite color between the two. Despite its problems, BN3 is excellent and one of the best games in the GBA’s library.

I didn’t mention the story, it doesn’t matter at all. It’s episodic children's anime stuff about as meaningful as a classic Mega Man plot, but with more yelling about friendship and hearts. It’s kinda fun thinking about how insane this world and its events are. The first dungeon in the series is a program forcing an oven to spit fire. It’s weirdly prophetic as well, considering how many of the scenarios are about bad guys hacking devices that shouldn’t have been made with any internet access to begin with. But if you want Deus Ex you should look elsewhere.

For what the collection adds, you get Mega Man talking to you on the game select menu, far from necessary but it’s nice. There’s typical extras like art galleries, trophies and a music player. The music is surprisingly good for GBA games, it’s like the system’s audio capabilities were made to make bubbly techno sound good and nothing else. You can import Japanese event exclusive chips which have been basically inaccessible by official means up until now. There’s also online PVP and chip trading to help you collect them all, definitely beats a link cable.

So for Volume 1 you get a rough prototype of a game and two great games. There’s a lot of stuff here, especially if you do post game content. I’d say it’s worth it even at its base price if you value excellent combat above all else.",1.0
3256,136811469.0,2273470,"After just doing the tutorial and assembling a single guitar, I wasn't sure if the game play loop would be enjoyable enough to warrant the 20 or so minutes it takes to complete the building process. But I gave it one more go without the tutorial, turning off the in-game music and putting on an Bomb the Music Industry! album I haven't heard before (SCRAMBLES), and found how the games starts to shine.

The act of juggling around multiple orders at a time makes the game play much more interactive. While a majority of the parts are pre-chosen by the customer, the user still gets to make some active decisions based on what's in stock, the desired quality and/or cost of the build, and a bit of creative freedom like the material of the body or the shape of the fret board markers. All the while, I found myself passively appreciating and critiquing the customer's choices as the guitar's body and colors start to form, looking at each one as though it was a real guitar. And since the game play wasn't too demanding, I was able to fully digest the music in the background, giving me a new way to activity listen to music outside of driving.

While there is still much to be explored that is locked in the prologue (working on new instruments, market/stock management, expanding/upgrading the workshop, mastering material proficiency, brand globalization, etc.) there are still plenty of areas in the game play that leaves some desires (such as not being able to wire/solder the electronics, no bridge adjustments, and the lack of responsiveness when strumming while playing the instrument). But overall the game seems very promising and is worth giving a shot by any music fan. Looking forward to what is added in the full release.

P.S. (Highly recommend trying it with your favorite music in the background. While I enjoyed the in-game music, substituting it transcends the experience.)",1.0

Protagonist goes to job/does mundane task but bad things are going on in the area, well doing said task/job spooky stuff happens and eventually the killer comes and you have to escape/confront said killer. 

It doesn't really tread any new ground, but I wouldn't say it is a bad game. Puzzles are enjoyable, I loved the chase music (it made the game feel like a cheesy b-movie which was a fun move), and the environments look nice. The biggest downside for me is that the game just isn't that scary. The atmosphere falls flat for me. I wasn't at all unsettled, just jump scared a few times. 

I had an enjoyable two hours, but I wouldn't recommend this one over games like Bloodwash or Murder House that  handled the formula better in my opinion. It's a solid 7/10 game for me.",1.0

This is a team game like siege, but without the special abilities (Which is perfect), special abilities would not work in the form of this game imo.

3263,136812422.0,1941780,"This game is very fun, sure its just run around and loot + Shoot now, but its obvious there is love put into this game.

I feel like most people have the issue where it feels repetitive but that's where games like this are the strongest. The Dev put it under the About section saying gameplay is subject to change and be more based on base building survival mixed with the elements already there. I played Solo and honestly it's still fun, but this game is also my cup of tea.

I can't wait to see how the game does in terms of development and moving forward because in my opinion it handles the wave survival genre really well.

Pros:
-Enemies have a chance to drop loot
-Bosses feel like a proper challenge especially where they are spawned at
-Loadouts before game starting makes it worth going for the bosses for unlocks
-Melee combat feels good when needing to conserve ammo and doesn't feel like a last option
-Different item types to let you build different ways as you explore
-The map telling you which houses have weapons is a nice touch to let you know what a starting goal is after spawning

Cons:
-Items feel scarce sometimes with having empty houses especially later in the game when healing and energy is really needed
-Stamina runs out pretty fast with it being drained by Sprinting,Rolling, and Jumping
-The area's all look the same so getting lost is very easy (Opening the map fixes this issue easily, but for some who have a hard time flicking between having map open and closed it can be challenging for some but not a big Con honestly)

I feel like as this game develops it will become a hit for friends to just hop on to have a good time and chill. and that overall is what makes it a good game in my opinion.",1.0

The music and art of this game are exceptional, and the exploration is very satisfying, especially when any part of the environment could be a key to understanding a key piece of lore.

The game does an AMAZING job of encouraging the player to engage in the lore, with many puzzles being tied directly to it. I dont think they are so complicated that you need a full understanding of the lore or anything close to it, but by asking the player to even lightly interact with the lore to progress, it gives a base level understanding of the world and story being told even to a player who may otherwise not be reading things or thinking about it.

Now, I know not everyone is into the storytelling side of things, and as far as game play goes, I have been thoroughly enjoying learning the combat. For me, the combat is secondary to what really makes this game so amazing, but it is still fun. The boss fights have been challenging but not frustrating so far, which I always appreciate.

I thought peasants would leave if they were homeless for too long since that's what the writing implied, but they just straight up starved to death without a home and dropped dead at the 'plaza.' So I unintentionally euthanized a third of my people when trying to replace peasants with common folk from lack of space. Then my common folk also began starving too- I'm wondering if ""They're more demanding"" means they consume more food? I got confused there.

Anyhow, after mass murdering dozens of people I made a new save and it's going great...

Coal makers feel highly inefficient with little employment, slow production, low desirability, and high upkeep after so many of them- only for the game to not even react if my people don't have coal to heat their homes in the winter. So I opted to just let them freeze since it's easy to ignore with no consequence. Coal makers are definitely my least favorite building in the game.

I hope the next neighboring ruler is a guy who looks... a touch more handsome than Giovanni... his character design is creative, funny, and unique- but I'm -not- that desperate. Oh dear.

I'd love a preview of what royalty/nobility points could unlock for me in the future. For now, I didn't care too much- though the pop up quests not having an option to decline without penalty (especially early on in the game) stressed me out. It felt like time was rolling the dice as to whether I was punished or punished less harshly, especially when struggling with money and food already. Hell, an option to turn those off for a more relaxing experience would be great too. It reminded me of sim city's random destruction events.

My least important peeve was the cake-like fog around the border edge of the map. Kinda kills my immersion when I view a map and the visual horizon from my camera doesn't match up, but I also have no idea how this could be fixed and I can see why the developers picked such a solution for now at least.

But for $60 (and I feel spoiled saying this cause I know it's only $10 a game or $6 if you include all versions) I expected more. This is literally the bare minimum and if this version didn't give you online battle and trading abilities the emulated versions would not only serve the same purpose for free but would actually be better. You would be able to have a black border that doesn't ruin oled screens, remap buttons, toggle run, fast forward, and save state for all the shitty stupid not fun parts. This version doesn't fix any of the old translation errors which is infuriating. ""Go left to get to the netdealer. Turn right at the square and follow the big path."" Apparently that means the netdealer is on the left and the square is to the right. Nonsensical. The left bumper ""hint"" is still useless garbage. Hmm I'm doing a quest so I can take the exam. What was the quest again or where am I supposed to go? Lemme ask for a hint. The hint just says lets finish the quest so we can take the exam. Like you seriously couldn't go back through and give real hints? So then you either look up a guide or jack out and run halfway across town to see what the quest was or where you are supposed to go. Can't set spoken and written languages separately. The graphics suck. I know I get it it's an old game but they said they remade it. You really couldn't upscale at all? You literally have to make the window smaller than your screen for it to look decent. Which leaves you with the border which can't be made plain black and is super ugly. Even if you play at full size there is still side borders because they didn't bother to make the game wide screen. There is some filter that is supposed to make it look better but it looks worse. And on top of all this stupid other bullshit they put denuvo on it which makes no sense because the only reason not to emulate the game is for the online capabilities. If somebody pirated this version it wouldn't have online and at that point it would just be worse than an emulator. There is literally no reason to pirate this version and they slap denuvo on it anyway and now people with steam decks and laptops can't play on the go without an internet connection. Idk man like I'm keeping the game and going to play because I don't have anything else I wanna play right now and I do want to trade and battle online and AGAIN THESE ARE REALLY FUN GAMES but this is just such a lazy minimal port that I can't recommend it for $60. Which again I feel bad saying knowing it's $6 a game but shit man they could have at least tried instead of coasting on the fact that online play would make this the only option. Very disappointing overall. If you aren't going to play online just get an emulator. There apparently is some previously japanese exclusive content in this version that wouldn't be in the emulated one but idk if that alone is worth $60 if you aren't going to play online.

There isn't anything wrong with it, with those nudity scenes throughout it's perfectly stellar. But when you look at it as a choice, you realize just how flawed you and the rest of humanity is.

What drove me to purchase such a game? What part of my soul felt so empty that I thought a virtual girl could fill it?

I don't understand why so much time was spent on raytracing when most gamers don't spend that kind of money on video cards, let alone people who play pinball.

I don't get what they were doing with the program in Early Access as it feels like it's still early access.

It's going to be a lot harder to enjoy it with less than 1/4 of my friends buying a single bundle of 3 tables.

Part of what I enjoyed in FX3 was competition and I made friends through it.

Wait until bugs are fixed and maybe a better discount is offered to FX3 customers.

3330,136829954.0,2328760,"After a bumpy birth, Pinball FX's debut on steam is off to a strong start. The Williams tables especially are of high quality. Great physics, great graphics, and integrated cabinet mode. They play exceedingly well, and I look forward to future releases. There are more improvements to be made, but it's off to a great start.

Initially a 1-year exclusive on another platform, tables were only purchasable in-game with tickets, The benefit of this was ostensibly cross-platform play, but the downside is that players would have been locked into the developers eco-system. 

Over the course of a year, and a lot of negative feedback, the developer changed their approach to allow direct-DLC purchases after it debuted on steam as they had on previous iterations of their pinball games. Players that purchased tables on other platforms were given a 1-time form to fill out to transfer tables to a single platform of their choice. 

Likewise, steam will detect if you own a table on Pinball FX3 and give users a 50% off credit to purchase the license for Pinball FX.",1.0

It is very cute though, with stylistic decisions I can get behind. I also like how they're making some of the structures less static than just placing squares and rectangles. They do need to extend this to more buildings than just housing and stockpiles though.

The biggest problem right now is that the ""fable"" part of the name is fairly cosmetic at this point. We are dealing with pigs with wings, there's a princess, and a talking tree somewhere on the map. Otherwise, it's just a regular city builder like you've played before. I've built the well for my houses in so many games. I've built the tavern to make my people happy countless times before. I've built the wheat farms for my windmills for my bakeries every year since playing Settlers II back on windows 98. Let me build and set up actual fable stuff.

3405,136834350.0,1922010,"This game is EXTREMELY good, if you liked Classic Siege, this is an absolute treat. The guns feel very satisfying, the reloads and grabbing are very slightly confusing, but just take some getting used to, and overall, the level of interactivity is moderately low, but just enough that it keeps the balance of the game in tact. 

Eco/weapons feel very similar to Valorant or CSGO, with the tiers for purchasing weapons, weapon classifications, and damage feeling more similar to Valorant. If you understand some of the buys there, things are very uncomplicated. There's good weapon variety, and I actually think that the reload system (you simply drop the mag and put a new one in, then wait for the weapon to be ready) evens out the skill gap present in reloading VR guns. I'm mixed on this because I am very fast at reloading guns, but it also allows more people to engage with the game elements in a deeper way if they aren't muddled down in the moment to moment reloads. 

The actual gameplay loop is extremely similar to when Siege first came out, with a slight mix of CS style throwables for good measure. Breaking down windows, clearing hallways, creating entries, it's all here aside from fully destroy-able walls. There are set breaching spots, but as I'm sure the designers of siege learned, that specific breach spots are probably for the best in terms of balance. Soft walls are a nightmare to balance around, and this game reaches a happy medium. 

The gadgets are all moderately futuristic, and with a very polished, cohesive tutorial, it all feels quite intuitive. ""Ease of use"" is a very nice way to put how most of the gadgets feel, aside from maybe grenades being that they have a higher skill ceiling inherently. 

The gunplay feels great, the guns all sound very chunky and powerful, even the default pistol sounds adequately loud. Big pluses all around. 

Movement is surprisingly smooth, with the ever looming threat of VR sickness, it's hard to find a game that sets this level of smooth movement, and does it in a way that (to me) feels extremely good. If you feel comfortable playing Pavlov, you're gonna be just fine here more than likely. 

That being said, Pavlov is a much more community focused game, whereas this game feels nearly competitive ready. The ability to see people only when teammates see them after death, the limitations on crouching, the ease of use, and the balance of weapons and gadgets, all of these are typically afterthoughts from developers after creating ""just another VR shooter"" but this game is one of the most polished, thorough experiences I've had so far in VR. This is, if you're into shooters, probably a must buy. Sure, there are lots of Quest players with dying headsets, and the audience might be a bit young, but that certainly doesn't take away from how great this game plays and feels. 

For the first time in a while, I got out of VR after getting a server disconnection, and as I write this I'm like, ""dang, I want to play more"" which hasn't happened in a very long time in VR.",1.0

* Unable to turn down/off audio of in-game announcer (the lady that yells about objectives).

* Recommend to hire a community manager or assign someone internally that is fluent in English to deliver better communication around the game to the non-China playerbase.

* Hopes of longer/larger/PvE/PvPvE game modes. Right now, running a short match with a small player count, going back to main menu, another quick game, main menu, quick game, main menu, it just isn't great for long-term replayability. I played 2 hours and felt like I went through 20 matches which wore me out.

* Accessibility options that may help with character rotation in space. This is one of those inevitable games where you'll feel the vertigo/motion sickness. Something that would allow forcing a vertical map so your character is unable to rotate with feet always at what would be considered the ground. I understand this could take away from immersion or the whole reason you're playing a game in space, but it's also not unreasonable if it can decrease player count because of uncontrollable dizziness. I also don't see the 'well if you can't flip around you're at advantage' - on the contrary, I would think players that can would have the advantage.

* You've spent years developing the most realistic FPS in space - why bog it down with cartoony/comedy skins and attachments and break the immersion? I'm sure the answer is that 'it sells', but this deserved to be mentioned. Imagine if the cosmetics and skins were military-esque or futuristic, as they should be?

While I haven't come across every enemy type yet there are a wide variety of vermin to deal with, such as you rats with shivs, snipers and a few others I won't mention as to not spoil the fun! You can try and deal with the vermin as they approach - but be warned that you will be overrun in a matter of rounds if they get out of hand.

During the turn based phase you can potentially find supplies that will help you once you reach a shelter. Once there you can create items, upgrade weapons and heal your soldiers to fight another day. You also get a little robot companion which is nice! DO NOT LET THEM DIE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!

- A fun gameplay loop that becomes repetitive after 4-5 scenarios. 
- Almost every scenario is moving left to right on the map, killing rats that appear predictably from corridors bordering the map. There is not much replay value, and maps are very linear.
- Not nearly as many scenario types (rescue missions, etc.) as XCOM.
- You'll either like the pixelart or dislike it. For me, it's a bit too pixely - I had trouble at times telling certain characters apart.
- Music and sounds are fantastic. Probably the best part of the game for me.
- The game is moderately challenging. It's not 'easy' as some might say, but once you learn the basic mechanics it's not hard to figure out the best placements for characters. 
- Each character has a mostly different role, though some are definitely more useful than others.
- The story is not very good; neither is the theme, at least not for me. It's mostly just there to provide an excuse to do some turn based tactics gameplay.
- The price is exactly where it should be for this game.

I sound negativem, but the game is still quyite fun for what it is. Don't expect the variety or polish of XCOM. Mechanics are shallow, but the gameplay loop of turn based tactics is satisfying enough, and the game is short enough, to make it worth it for the price.

The detail in the houses/decorations make towns feel more real and alive. It's fun to just sit back and watch the world go.

There are some kinks to work out in regards to food supply imo, but nothing game breaking at the moment. It seems as if almost 1/2 of my land is devoted to vegetables, creating a constant need of an army of low level citizens to run them (farms are one of the, if not the, only building limited to low level citizens). But this seems like something that will likely be tweaked, or remedied by higher level food sources/buildings we don't have access to yet. 

I love the little event scenarios you can uncover. I've had a few that give some cosmetic decorations, and one that gave a permanent buff (and was a talking tree. love that). Hoping to see more of the later, so the events can feel more impactful and permanent in the world.

3460,136840475.0,1567000,"I think this is mostly good and very impressive for being a solo dev project.
The art style is amazing, and I love the environments for most of the levels, with the city, the dali world, and the 2nd to last level being the highlights and my favorite levels in general. 

Shooting is very basic and turning enemies into gore is always fun, but the gunplay and enemy variety is probably the weakest part of the game, especially since by the halfway point you've seen everything and the game never throws new mechanics at you.

Music is also good. The last thing I'll say is with an aesthetic this great I wish there was a little more going on with narrative, and things that tied the levels and characters together, because it's close to feeling cohesive and interesting but nothing really backs it up. I do like that what little story there is, is told entirely visually.

I think if the dev decides to do another project I'd love to see a slower paced exploration, puzzle or even horror game that really gives you time to milk the art design and environments",1.0
3461,136839776.0,1567000,"Love this game. I plan to do a full video review at some point, but I'll summarize my feelings here for now. 20 dollars and a 3-hour first playthrough well-spent.

There is no real story to this game. By the dev's own admission. I...kinda hate that John Carmack ""story in video games is like story in porn"" quote, but I do like how little is elaborated on here. It doesn't just leave things open to interpretation, but it also leaves the game unshackled from any kind of ""canon"" it has to build on. With that said, the little setpieces and environmental storytelling does create this sense of a connected experience I quite enjoy.

Speaking of setpieces and environments, this game oozes style. Every level is distinct in aesthetic, and often uses assets entirely unique form other levels. It's creepy and cartoony and deliciously visceral. I believe it's heavily implied to be a sort of dream that the player is experiencing. To that end, I kind of wish there was more abstract level design. Maybe titles like Anemoiopolis and MyHouse.wad spoiled me too much, but despite the surreal environments, the worlds often feel surprisingly grounded and cohesive. If there were ever any sort of sequel to this title, I hope the dev leans into things like what they did with the mirrors in Mystique House and go all-out with that non-euclidian space warping. I love that stuff any day of the week, and I cannot get enough.

Oh yeah and the OST slaps like a motherfucker. I've been calling it ""Burtoncore,"" since that seems to evoke the sense of what you can expect from it. synthey, playful, but at the same time sinister and foreboding.

The gameplay is pretty simple. You got a jump and a double jump, and a bunch of guns that will feel pretty familiar to your average FPS enjoyer. Notable exceptions to this are the Microwave Gun - a replacement for your standard automatic which has the notable benefit of blowing up enemies if you can train your beam on them long enough. Think the Amid Evil Voltride, but much easier to pull off consistently. Also, the Worm Gun. I love the Worm Gun. One of the most unique and interesting guns in the game - and most fps games. Shoot a leech at your foes, set it and forget it (sorta like a Blood Flare Gun), but once it does its business, the leech becomes saturated with blood - and depending how much it got to feed, you can, uh...eat it. And heal up to 10hp! Try using it on the Pigbots!

Even though most of the other weapons don't do anything terribly unique, they still feel great. You'll pick up an AR later on which is functionally superior to your base Shotgun in every way, but I still used the Shotgun. Because shooting it felt great and so does the flip-cock. I'm a sucker for flips and cock. We've all seen Grenade Launchers, but Illwill's firing speed and arc feels so satisfying. Once you play around with it a bit, it can start feeling almost second-nature to land direct hits with it. It isn't quite Blood TNT levels of intuition, but it's very close.

That said, there is some bloat to the weapon roster. Some redundancy in your guns. Regundancy, if you will. I think the game could remove the Rocket Launcher, Assault Rifle, and Soul Extractor, and not lose much besides additional ammo pools. The Soul Extractor is kind of interesting - killing Painheads with it won't cause them to explode when they die, and as far as I can tell, it prevents the target from shooting at you - but it's really just a high-damage automatic, and its little nuances rarely play a factor in how you use it.

The weapon balance migh have some misses in my option, but the enemy balance is EXCELLENT. Every enemy has a unique role, and the ways they play off of eachother, around the arenas, and against you makes for some great-feeling combat.

One other thing I'd like to mention: I really love the game's secret collectible. By collecting one of the three violins in each level, the player can increase their damage within that level by 10% - up to 30% with all 3. What a cool little reward for exploration! If you got good secret-hunting skills, you're rewarded with shorter kill times on automatics and in some cases, better kill thresholds on your shotguns and explosives! I really like that. :)

Overall, I'd give this game a 4/5. Really good, solid title. I really like a lot of the systems here. But it could stand to be refined a little. If I ever see DLC or a followup to this in the future, I'll be snapping it up in an instant. Until then, I'm gonna 100% the shit outta this game.",1.0

3477,136843308.0,1649740,"If I had to describe [i]Hunt the Night[/i] in it's current state, I would say it feels unfinished, almost like it should have been released in early access for some extra polish.

Don't get me wrong, there's a lot going for the game: the pixel art, the music, the atmosphere, the world-building, the puzzles.

But there's just so many bad and confusing design choices that, despite 100%ing the game, leave me not wanting to recommend it until they work on it a bit more.

The biggest issue I have is with the combat: enemies have busted hitboxes, hit just a little too hard, and the combat is too clunky to allow you to handle encounters effectively. There's no animation-cancelling and no permanent way beyond gear to increase your attack or defense, just your HP, and beyond the max healing charges of 5, lifesteal is your only way of getting health back despite not working on everything. You can also poison enemies, but the proc chance and damage are so low it's almost not worth it.

The encounter design in particular is absolutely awful, with the game often swarming you with dozens of enemies, projectiles, or both that respawn between load screens despite the clunky combat not allowing you to handle multiple things going on at once very well. [spoiler]There's also a few bosses that ask the question of, ""what if it was the same encounter but now there's two of them? Or what if they can spawn trash mobs infinitely?""[/spoiler]

There are also quite a few enemies that, while they do telegraph their attacks, have such a short reaction window that you're almost guaranteed to take damage from them unless you pick them off using a ranged attack. [spoiler]The invisible guys in particular are extremely annoying to deal with in packs for this reason[/spoiler].

And considering combat, the most tedious aspect of the game, is also the core focus of the game, I found myself opting to run past all of the enemies after a certain point because it was not worth the time it took to fight them.

There's also a few small things I had issue with, such as:

• The dash allowing you to fall off ledges or into bodies of liquid, only for the game to spawn you across the map or in another room entirely instead of the last surface you were standing on
• Cutscenes replaying after failing to defeat certain bosses, instead of skipping straight to the encounter
• One-way trips not having a confirmation before yeeting you into the abyss, resulting in needless backtracking
• Area transitions that are poorly signposted save for some different lighting on the floor
• No maps, although most areas aren't too difficult to navigate
• Hunts not being marked as complete at the tavern
• No audiovisual feedback when your dark energy is full or cooldown is over
• No bestiary or game stats menu
• Not enough weapon, gear, and enemy variety
• Bizzare and jarring load-stutters when saving or transitioning to a new area

Also, there's a pretty major softlock after completing a puzzle (that resets itself if you get it wrong for some reason) in the final dungeon, [spoiler]Bloodisfell Cathedral,[/spoiler] and some other bugs such as levers getting stuck, players not being able to attack, getting stuck in geometry, and  item pickup notifications not appearing or using the wrong template. [spoiler]The Apothecary keys didn't have notifications and the white snake scale used the default NPC dialogue instead of the item notification[/spoiler].

But with all that being said I definitely think the game is worth keeping an eye on, so give it a few months or wait for a sale if it looks interesting.

Pros: 
- Cute dog/cat animations when playing with toys
- Diversity in pets with inclusion of fish, rabbits, turtles
- Pet 'perks' (should be called traits..) add good diversity to gameplay

Cons:
- The mini-games for playing with pets are a bit boring, and often feel unnecessary or slow. If they were more entertaining and fast paced, the experience would be better
- Dogs/Cats can clip through walls, fences, gates, doors etc. I released my dogs into my yard and had to chase them all across the world to get them back. And I had a cat who just couldn't be contained.
- Having to manually input booking info isn't a good gameplay choice as it adds nothing but a bit of annoyance. I'd remove it, and have booking info input automatically after you accept the pet through a phone call.
- There should be an option to adopt your own pet that can free-roam the hotel whilst you're there, it'd be fun to name one and look after it yourself.

3509,136877514.0,1714250,"First I'd like to reiterate, I adored the prologue, I've played too many hours of it, so it's with a heavy heart that I can't currently recommend this game.

I will say, the decorating tool is one of the best I've seen in any game, at all, it's outstanding that we have triple A titles that cost hundreds to be complete, yet this comes along and blows it out of the water from graphics to accessibility/creating. 

However, I feel like the 2 modes we get on starting up the game, leave something to be desired for. Challenge mode, which is the only ""career"" mode feels like it throws you in the deep end, I restarted 4 times alone because the amount of animals to handle from day one was overwhelming to say the least. Every room was full, most animals had low needs from the get go, even after cleaning, clipping, washing, feeding, double checking feeding, then play, play play, and boom I hadn't enough time before an animal had serious mood decay. 

Then sandbox mode goes the extreme in the other way, nothing feels like it matters, the challenge is gone which was a main draw for me to enjoy this game, I'd like the game a lot more with a balanced experience, I feel like there isn't much in between the animals moods all decaying, which feels totally random aswell. I remember having to feed a single fish 3 times in a single day and by the time I had done this single thing, 5 animals all needed to be played with in separate, slow interactions.

Unfortunately I don't wanna beat a dead horse, I hope in future updates the balancing is expanded more as this game has some of the most perfect ingredients I've come across in a simulation/Strategy game, it gives me old Nintendogs and relaxing time wasters, it's just the strategy needs some polishing for me to feel I can enjoy it yet :)

Forgetting why you love what you do, or that you loved it once, because others are throwing stones at you when you try following your passion.

This game is about nature, but for me it felt so much like it wasn't ""only"" about the nature outside, but although the nature of creativity/ideas inside of us (our mind, heart or soul or whatever you want to call it) which are being destroyed or forgotten over the time of our life.

The mini games were nice, diverse and satisfying to play and watch. I liked how the character watched the grass growing. And collecting the birds and clouds, or drawing the star constellations without knowing what the final shape would be.

When I started the fragile mode, I wasn't sure if there was a point in trying to ""clean"" the moon, or if I was meant to fail. But in the end I made it. The fragile mode was definitely a challenge compared to the first story mode, but it was a fair one.

3519,136879299.0,2239870,"Small People Defense is a charming tower defense title. The price point is staggeringly low and for the amount of content you get, it's an absolute steal. It's only in early access but the game already feels so fluid and fun!

I am a huge fan of tower defense and generally try to play as many of them as I can and this is one of the better titles I've seen recently. The unique interactions between towers are challenging to use and the added strategic depth is a welcome addition.

The first few levels I played had me restricted to only 2 towers but I still had difficulties completing them with 3 stars (you get ranked out of 3). However, this didn't seem to affect the amount of points I had to spend in the out-of-game upgrade screen to too much of a significant degree which I felt was fair and nicely done.

You quickly gain access to more towers, more levels and upgrades. The strategies and enemy variety are great and I cannot wait to play more. I especially like how each tower has an individual targeting behavior instead of merely targeting the closest target. For example, the fire tower targets only enemies that are not yet ""on fire"" and as such spreads the debuff evenly between them, which is a fantastic mechanic in my opinion.

The points you gain from completing levels can be spent on upgrades that provide more starting money, more HP for your base, higher DPS for whichever tower you choose and so on. They are also spent on unlocking new levels. The points required for new level unlocks are again fair and not at all costing the world which means the developer respects your time and doesn't force you to grind constantly to unlock things.

The way towers work in the game was a refreshing change as well, they use a projectile based system where placement of towers actually has a profound effect on how efficient each tower is. For example, place a tower perpendicular and far away from the enemy path? You're going to have problems killing much at all! But place it in line or along the angle of the path? Now you'll be cooking with gas! This is just one of many things I noticed in the game that I really appreciated.

The only thing I would like to see implemented is a way to toggle/an option in the game menu to see an overlay of what upgrade level each tower has without you having to run to it with your character and checking, so seeing it at a glance would be beneficial. Especially in larger levels where you may not be able to manage many towers too easily. The upgrades are represented already as each tower grows larger in size but this is sometimes a little obtuse as you may not easily notice the difference between level 5 or level 6. A minor thing to be sure but it would definitely be a welcome improvement.

Overall, I have a lot of fun with the game and I hope to be able to find some time to play more soon!",1.0
3520,136878994.0,847780,"A good introduction to the mechanics and the world, but it can't stand on its own because of the excessive fourth-wall breaking and unplayable combat on the hardest setting.

The vibrant graphics are the first thing you notice. Although the art style has been seen before and it’s not particularly original, it somehow makes the game stand out. The game has a third-person view with a rotatable camera when you're outside, but as soon as you enter a house or other enclosed area, the camera switches to a static top-down view.

The story is filled with comedy and moments where characters break the fourth wall. In my opinion, they go too far with these. Everything has to be a joke, a reference to something modern, the awareness of being in a videogame, etc. 

The characters mainly smile and move around in smooth animations with a few different facial expressions to convey mood. Talking to people is done very well. To ensure that you don't miss anything, whenever they speak, a speech bubble appears over their head. While the majority of them may be easily ignored if you don't want to hear their mundane words, you must pay attention to the blue speech bubbles that advance the plot.

However, interaction with the world adopts a traditional style that makes things easy to overlook. What I mean by this is that hotspots aren’t marked. Some things like chests are obvious, but some are very random. You might try interacting with several cupboards and get no feedback, but then you interact with another that looks exactly the same and find something new. Even though these are optional and solely contribute to the world-building, it’s still a shame to hide them like this.

The world has a distinctive appearance since it is formed of blocks. With the exception of high places, the exploring is mostly pleasant. It's odd that your heroine has to face challenges every time she tries to reach higher spots. Imagine a set of stairs; if you take each step in order, you can climb a hill; if you try to skip a step, you'll run into a wall. This is the simplest approach to illustrate the issue.  

Everything conforms to the traditional JRPG structure. This entails fighting in random and turn-based battles, purchasing and equipping new gear, using items, etc. The use of skills is the slightly different mechanic. These operate on points that carry over to subsequent battles and gradually recharge after each turn. 

Even though you control only three fighters at a time, your party can have up to six characters who can step in to take the place of the active fighter when their turn comes. Although it may seem like you'll have an easier time, a character's death throws everything out of the window. Because a healthy character won't automatically take its position after being knocked down and because you can't switch it until you bring it back from the dead, the problem is that a downed character is practically a dead weight. An extremely odd and senseless design decision. 

Another weird decision is the inclusion of difficulty settings. This should be removed. While playing on easy level makes sense if you want to focus on the story, playing on hard makes the game absolutely unplayable because of unbalanced encounters. You’re constantly walking back to your bed to heal after every battle or wasting revive items on companions who are killed in one hit.

But what I really found interesting is the mechanic where you fill out information about enemies. Each enemy begins with a card that is entirely blank and has only question marks. From health and experience points to status effects and drops, this card has it all.

Information can be obtained in a variety of ways. You have three options: utilize a scan magic, defeat the enemy, or hit it with various weapons, which is the least useful approach because you don't always have everything in your arsenal. If you keep fighting, you will eventually obtain all of the data since at least one piece of information will be filled out each time you scan or eliminate an enemy. The perk of collecting info is that you can skip a fight.",1.0

Almost every stealth game I play teaches me something new about the whole stealth genre, tells me a unique story about its creation and aims of its developers. This game is no exception, stealth here feels unique, smooth and rough at the same time. It feels like it offers similar options as other stealth games, but in some aspects it's much more diverse, and the one mechanic that separates it from literally anything else is the fact that you are as blind ad your enemies. It is similar to submarine simulators in that regard, but here it's much easier to sink in this mechanic. Feels refreshing to be somewhat on par with your rivals.

3545,136880503.0,1611960,"Doomed Lands is a top-down pixel art survival game where the player is transported to a post-apocalyptic environment where the world is dominated by horrible and mutant creatures. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible while facing these threats, collecting resources, and fighting for your life.

One of the highlights of Doomed Lands is its atmosphere. The pixel art graphics, with a dark and somber color scheme, add a sense of despair and constant danger. The soundtrack also contributes to this atmosphere, with ambient sounds that bring the game world to life and add tension to the most dangerous moments.

The gameplay of Doomed Lands is challenging, with limited resources and threats around every corner. The player needs to manage their hunger, thirst, and energy, as well as dealing with hostile monsters and other dangers that arise as they progress through the game world. There is also the possibility of encountering other survivors who may help or hinder the player, adding an extra layer of complexity and unpredictability to the game.

A negative point of Doomed Lands is the lack of variety in terms of enemies and resources. Although there are some different types of monsters and resources, overall, the game can become repetitive after a few hours of gameplay.

However, overall, Doomed Lands is a solid and well-executed top-down pixel art survival game. With its dark atmosphere and challenging gameplay, it offers an immersive and engaging gaming experience for players seeking an intense challenge.",1.0
3546,136880531.0,2368510,"A great little indie arcade gem for a really low price. 

Though the developer has released titles on other platforms in the past, Soulvester VS Lil' Beezey is the first Steam release from developer Chaz Carter and it's a fantastic debut. The game has the same chaotic fun energy of classic Newgrounds hits, with the polish and quality of a modern release. The voice acting by Dicky Carter is perfect and gives me the same fun vibe as titles like BattleBlock Theater. The gameplay is fast and responsive, the sound effects are satisfying and everything about it oozes charm - it had me grinning from ear to ear as I finished my first run. 

There's still room for improvement: the game is extremely short and replay value is limited (outside of posting high scores), but it's still a bargain at the current price and this could easily be fixed in a future update by adding some form of meta progression, like adding more upgrades to the pool as you unlock achievements.

The music in Energy Survivors is absolutely captivating. The soundtrack features a perfect blend of futuristic electronic beats, intense battle themes, and haunting melodies that perfectly complement the game's sci-fi setting. The music dynamically shifts based on the in-game situations, creating a seamless and immersive experience. I found myself getting lost in the game's world, thanks in part to the engaging and atmospheric soundtrack that kept me hooked from start to finish.

In addition to the outstanding music, the overall game feel in Energy Survivors is exceptional. The controls are smooth and responsive, allowing for precise aiming and movement, which is crucial in a third-person shooter game. The animations are fluid, and the graphics are visually stunning, creating a visually appealing and immersive world to explore. The roguelite mechanics add an element of replayability, as each run presents new challenges and opportunities for experimentation with different upgrades.

I also appreciated the variety of upgrades available in the game, which allowed me to create unique and powerful builds to suit my playstyle. Experimenting with different combinations of upgrades was not only fun but also strategic, as I had to carefully choose my upgrades to adapt to the challenges of the hostile planet I was exploring.

Overall, Energy Survivors left a lasting impression on me with its incredible music and game feel. The captivating soundtrack and immersive gameplay made for an unforgettable gaming experience.

3560,136887294.0,2372750,"I thought the game was just okay, not much content though, it only has 4 stages and +2 bonus levels, so about 60 minutes on normal difficulty. Also, I had a few small problems with the clipping on the hitbox, for example whenever you have to dash between any spikes, sometimes it's a bit tricky to avoid the walls. I think one area took me about 10 tries, and in general, I feel like the dev went a little crazy on the enemy spam. That said, you can lower the difficulty which will negate the HP problems, but the game is still has a few weird platforming sections.

One thing I would recommend is to have at least 2 areas per biome, most devs would stretch the themes for a couple of stages, but you only had 1 or 2 areas for the same visuals; If you already created enough assets to make the level look unique, you might as well make it last for more than 10 minutes. A few other small nitpicks I have, some of the thorns had a very similar color to the ground, might want to make it a bit darker, and I was a bit confused by the damage, some enemies seem to do 1 damage, and others are doing 2 or 3?

Other than that, I thought the levels and the cutscenes looked decent, with a few cute moments in the narrative. 

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

(+) Well, the game is mostly average in every aspect, aside from a few polish issues, it plays decently, it looks okay, music is nice (not sure if made for the game), and it has a few funny scenes.

[h1] Feedback: [/h1]

[u] Content [/u] - you have enough variety between the stages, but I felt like you didn't make enough actual platforming between the zones, like you have stages that look nice, but only 1 area per theme. Usually, devs will make 3 or 4 areas per zone, so you could use what you already have and just make more platforming content. Even one of the bonus stages looks like a dungeon, but you didn't really use those tiles much. 

[u] Gameplay [/u] - the thorns need a bit of color coding. I had some issues with the tight spots between the spikes, easy to clip the hitbox, maybe make those areas a bit wider so you not hitting the ceiling all the time. The platforming momentum felt just slightly off to me, I think he falls down just slightly too fast, and the base walking speed without running probably should be a bit higher. 

[b] Overall Thoughts: 6/10 [/b]

The biggest thing for me, like I said, you have different themes, but only 1 area per location for the most part, usually it's 3 or 4 right, you don't even need to make more assets, just use those that you already have to make more content.I felt like the level design was a bit crowded in terms of hazards, even though the game plays decently it's very easy to feel like something is unfair. The game is technically not bad, it just feels like you didn't fully optimize the stages so there are some small moments that can be frustrating. I think you need to make the movement a bit more gradual in the mid-air.

You can view my initial impressions review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/9S853VgxaAY

One of the best, if not the best, free to play VR music rhythm games on Steam. It's really just a notch or two below Audio Trip or Synth Riders. It's got a pretty good soundtrack from Yandex Music that I was actually digging.

It looks nice. The gameplay is solid (just not as good as Synth Riders or Audio Trip). The visuals look really good for a free to play title. The music is pretty good. You get a very good workout as well. 

Game is running on the Unity Engine. On my RTX 3080, I was getting mostly 90 fps, with just some drops here and there that did not effect gameplay. You can play seated or standing (game is much easier playing seated). Beware though: even on easy, this is quite the workout. You'll have to do some squats to reach the orbs when they are placed low. That's the main reason why I had to tap out after 30 minutes (I'm out of shape though).

[b]Rate 8/10. Not sure why it's free, but I'll take it.[/b]

Yes there is not much to do, the developer took a little project and let us have a look at it and get feedback.

You can view my initial impressions review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/9S853VgxaAY

One of the best, if not the best, free to play VR music rhythm games on Steam. It's really just a notch or two below Audio Trip or Synth Riders. It's got a pretty good soundtrack from Yandex Music that I was actually digging.

It looks nice. The gameplay is solid (just not as good as Synth Riders or Audio Trip). The visuals look really good for a free to play title. The music is pretty good. You get a very good workout as well. 

Game is running on the Unity Engine. On my RTX 3080, I was getting mostly 90 fps, with just some drops here and there that did not effect gameplay. You can play seated or standing (game is much easier playing seated). Beware though: even on easy, this is quite the workout. You'll have to do some squats to reach the orbs when they are placed low. That's the main reason why I had to tap out after 30 minutes (I'm out of shape though).

[b]Rate 8/10. Not sure why it's free, but I'll take it.[/b]

It's good fun and does a lot of little things that keep it feeling polished. I wouldn't think it's an early access release if I didn't see the banner.

Having to navigate and consider your facing orientation helps give this a more challenging edge than it's peers in terms of action, and it's fun just running around bashing some of the little enemy units. Still feels like I'm early into it, but I'm hoping to see some more weaponry and tactics that use the strafe vs random targeting since that's a key feature that makes it feel unique.

The format gives you more tangible goals too (reach wave 15) vs. open ended survive as long as possible which I appreciate. Animations are solid, you can tell a lot of work was done to not only get a lot of enemies on screen but also give you plenty of nice destruction effects going on.

Some criticisms I would give to the game:
-The music is fine but the sound effects are a bit too ""sharp"" and it kinda hurts the ears after a while.
-There was no way to refer to the controls after the initial level. It would be nice to have a controls list in the pause menu.
-Trying to line up the mech using the Spacebar was also a bit frustrating as you're weaving around enemies and running straight eventually leads to running into a big crowd.
-The lack of control over the mech itself. I feel like this game is designed more for mobile in mind, so maybe that's the point, but I was really hoping to pilot the mech and have some control over the actions I performed other than WASD. Maybe have an option to automate/manually control certain actions, as well as be able to make the mech spin using the mouse (or using the arrow keys?) independently from movement. This also made it particularly frustrating when trying to fight the bosses, as I couldn't put my focus on any specific type of enemy.

So far, everything else is good and looking forward to playing more. Hope the best for future updates!",1.0

First, the game developer is very lazy. Below is how he or she solves tech issue. 

EA 1.01 bug fix

.....Quote: Important: for those bug to work, please delete the following file in your computer\Users\user name\AppData\LocalLow\senmu\Three kingdom game. Unquote

First not everyone is technical enough to find this file. Second this is not the right way to solve tech issue in a game. I will not recommend people to buy at this moment.

Second, the general cards are very weak in design, either over point or the growth over time is not really worth it. Just need to get a weapon and armor option is better than any general cards.
Take example: Guan Yu, 3 point to use...+1 permenant attack to HIS card only when he killed a enemy. But there are many cards that increase OVERALL attack which cost lesser points. By the 10 rounds, it is useless as there are many cards option. In fact, Guan Yu card is a handicap to your deck LMAO in the start. You don't need to overkill the enemy. Same apply to Zhan Fei, useless card. These 2 cards needs to be redesign.",0.0

66,136909029,1851030,"Okay so first off I'll lead this review by saying that it is a good game, the charting is excellent and it's insanely fun to play for what it is. However there are two glaring issues, one has a work around, one doesn't. The horizontal note lane is fucking atrocious for reading notes, especially if you come from any other rhythm game ever made. There's a reason with Taiko no Tatsujin and Muse Dash limit the game to just two note types, because horizontally the notes become overwhelming to read. This can be fixed by flipping your monitor into portrait mode through Windows however, though you're stuck with mirrored notes if you need downscroll. The second issue is that the health bar is just too far away from the rest of the information, this is a rhythm game so your eyes are glued to a certain part of the screen at all times, and they designed the ultra and EX meters well enough with this in mind, however, the health is on the complete opposite end of the screen making it pretty much a no go to look at unless you're on a simple part of the song and your opponent isn't completely ruining you with garbage. It's a fun game but it needs some sort of UI customization, which is something that many people were asking for in the discussions and it seemed like the creators of this game refused to listen to them. As is I can't fully recommend this game since you have to physically flip your screen or with a setting to be able to play it well.",0.0

76,136911964,2317560,"Brief comment of producer Yang Zhongping

As a gamer playing this game since 2022, I feel like it’s necessary to introduce our dear official to fellow gamers.

1, producer Yang the fatty has worked in several companies, like ByteDance and Xindong. Eventually he joined Mihoyo’s dev team and scammed more than 100 million RMB (about 15million USD) with only 20 men and within 2 years. These money are all for his own purpose, like larger apartments and cars in Shanghai. Although his project in Mihoyo was eventually killed, Liu Wei, the CEO of Mihoyo still allowed him to take all project-related resource for his own game. When the beta test of this game started, all Mr. Yang did is to reap gamers’ wallets. A typical banner is 10 rolls with 200 RMB, and only get a guarantee after 150 rolls. 

2, Yang takes a rough attitude towards players’ reporting, he would ban accounts which are innocent, simply because they were reported by their opponents. Whenever you feel like your opponent in this match is using game mechanics as an advantage or simply unhappy today, then report your opponent and you will never see him again. Yang also forces gamers to follow his rule and never listen to suggestions, even if himself doesn’t understand how his game works. Last but not least, Yang would release update patch during the critical moment of a match (a typical match usually lasts 2-3 days) and the server maintenance would last hours, resulting in players losing advantage.

3, as a producer of the game, Yang hacks every time he fight against real players. As an ordinary gamer, I’m lucky enough to meet this occasion once and witnessed him hacking during a live stream. When we are about to complain about this, Yang emphasized that he created the game and no one shall oppose him. He doesn’t care about players’ account and threatened to sell them. We have never received any apologies for this.

4, Yang has been avaricious, he only cares about money but not gamers. Adding in-game purchase in RTS??? I’m sure EN players would meet “unlimited corner turret” and more unreasonable things in the future. He also added in-game ADs as a bonus, which is simply because his Taobao account was reported and he needs another way to reap gamers. Now he has a EN server, and in-game purchase would be activated again to take money from your wallets, legally. 

5, recently the price for a vehicle banner has raised from 10 rolls a guarantee to 40 rolls a guarantee, forcing gamers to pay much more money to obtain full game experience. Unlike other gacha games, players who refuse to pay abundant money in this game have very little game experience.

6, Yang was also found in Wechat selling players’ accounts which have been permanently banned by him. As stated before, Yang takes an arbitrary attitude in banning accounts, and these accounts which have abundant resources along with full arsenal are sold at a much lower price. In summary, players are viewed as four-leg livestock, awaiting to be reaped randomly.

From close test to beta test, this game has already witnessed a great loss of population in merely several months. Strongly suggest whoever still playing this game not to pay, and if possible, not to play. There are better games in Steam, and there’s no need to stick to this piece of shit. Just let Yang the fatty being the dictator, since there are only two guys left in his dev and he personal attacked his own customer service.

And after reading on the store page that leveling was different, I figured I would try it out.
The ""world""/dungeon is comprised of narrow tunnels connected to small - big rooms, that have enemies potions etc in them.
But enemies are stationary and will not move in any way, and to attack them you move into them until your hp is low, then you take a potion and continue bumping into them. When enough of the same enemy have been killed you get a stat based on that enemy.

Sadly this was not for me, but I wish them the best of luck <3

1. Ball physics is better on Willams tables, but not necessarily on Zen tables

3. Sound are a little bit clearer on Willams tables
4. Menu is way better than Pinball FX 3, can get to a table much faster
5. The new tables are nice

Here's what I don't like:

1. 50% discount on table already owned in Pinball FX 3... I can understand that they have to rework some of these tables, but having to buy everything again!!!.  Discount could have higher (like at 75% - 90% discount).  I only bought a few tables I already owned.
2. Still missing some old tables (I would really like to see the ""Street Fighter"" table and ""Ms Splosion Man"" table that was made years ago)
3. New ball physics on old zen table takes time to get used to (especially if switching between FX and FX 3)
4. Some server connexion problems

[u]I understand the controversy behind this release.[/u]

Business model aside, this [i]is[/i] the better way to play. The tables feel much better. As much as I loved FX3, the physics were all over the place and some tables felt very slow and floaty. Others felt like you were playing with a marble rather than a heavy steel pinball. This release addresses all of these issues and makes each tables physics feel unified. Obviously there are some tables that feel faster in pace, but it feels that way now because of the table design rather than the wacky physics. Some tables have become easier, some have become much harder because of this change. And I like this! 

If you can deal with the fact that you'll have to rebuy any tables you previously owned on FX3 (albeit at a discounted price now!) and that some of the new releases come with a premium price tag, you're in for a real treat. Personally, I play a stupid amount of pinball, so the thought of spending £7-£10 on a single table seems like a deal to me. I'd be spending well over £10-£30 playing real physical tables, so to buy and keep some of my favourite real tables for under a tenner is great.

96,136914447,1364020,"Boundary is the most unique shooter to come out in the last 5 years and it breaks my heart that it will soon be another sign that people only want standardized shooters the crosshair travels mainly across the x-axis. I have never seen a shooter with such deliberate mechanics that emphasize gunplay. It takes advantage of the space theme to innovate and improve on the COD formula. Unlike COD, camping is not strong because the game always warns you of enemy presence. Furthermore, tagging enemies temporarily mark them on your minimap, allowing you to ensure your kill. Grenade spam is not encouraged because of the delayed weapon switch and slow rate of usage, ensuring that such utility is used deliberately instead of liberally for lucky kills. These features also serve to prevent complete curb stomping in lobbies by few players because it forces them to temporarily retreat before reengaging. Combined with the ability to turn any ""low ground"" to ""high ground"", the game provides the player all the tools necessary to engage the enemy on their terms, only being limited by the player's creativity. I firmly believe that the reviews that criticize this game for it's ""lack of replayability"" or the ""lack of progression"" are largely unfound. The player movement allows you to manipulate the map, breaking conventional ideas of positioning and engagement. Every match can be a new way to explore the same map as opposed to a static environment. The game also simplifies unlocking attachments and cosmetics to getting kills with a character with a gun. No need to get 50 kills mounted to a wall or getting 5 kills with a character. Playing the game to unlock all items in the game is a weird feature to criticize especially for a price less than $30 USD.  The failure of this game to survive makes it very clear to people only want the same big esport tactical shooters or battle royales with long battle passes again and again.

The two complaints I do have do not take away from the overall experience but things I hope are ironed out by the time early access ends. The first feature needed is the ability to customize the HUD or make the HUD like other fps. Having the radar not on the top left and the weapons on the right is jarring to see. The second complaint is for the inclusion of louder music. I could play my own music in the background but it would be nice to have atmospheric jazz or classical music picked by the devs playing.

I love most of the map, some confined and some open, All of the locations are in space but, I think some more close grounded map should be considered in the future (such as planets). Props need improvement. Some guns exposing the players from hiding out. The station should not stayed stationary, it easier to spot the player because player is the only subject that is moving.

The game is very face-paced, too fast for my liking, but it does compromised with the speed of changing gears, reload and the cooldown time of your gadgets.

Many a time I have tried so hard to go down the Non-pay route (Sure it takes a lot of time to progress) to see if it can be done and with some games this can be achieved, Eternium being one of them as an example, but this game makes it near on impossible with what can be viewed as hours and hours of grinding just to complete one part of a task (if trying the non-paying style of play). And with the addition of an energy system that depending on what you do determines how quickly it drains. Completing tasks become very laborious, very quickly.

This is a game that is designed to be played by somebody on their phone whilst on a break from work or waiting for a bus. Log on complete one task, log off. It is not designed to be continuously played on PC.

So, I looked up the devs for this game and although it is their first game that they have made and released (from what I could see anyway) what they have created had the potential to be very good but I feel the way they have executed it, is a slight 'dropped the ball' moment, especially with the energy system which is generally viewed in a heavily negative light.

The game is only about 10 hours long but has some extra content to unlock if you're a real masochist.

My most frustrating gripe is a lack of a map. The game has the Soulsborne approach to progression and exploration where you only get a general hint about where to go but then you're on your own. This would be fine but the game doesn't have enough visual cues in some dungeons to direct you toward the goal and you can totally miss that one door you need to walk through if you just didn't happen to scroll the screen far enough in the right direction.

The story of Hunt the Night is fairly light, limited to a handful of conversations. However the true depth is in the environmental storytelling present in notes and destruction throughout the world. In addition, the backstory is set up through a world concept of infusing feathers with memories. These provide a lot of detail. And there are about 30 of them in all.

The sound in the game is excellent. The combat sound effects feel appropriate and provide lots of feedback. And the soundtrack is very fitting for the atmosphere of the different biomes present in the game.

The gameplay loop of Hunt the Night is quite fun. You generally solve a few puzzles on the way to the boss room in the five dungeons. The puzzles break up the combat nicely and they are not too difficult. You’ll end up facing 10 main quest bosses and optionally 10 hunt mini bosses, which are supped up versions of normal enemies. As for the enemies themselves there are 17 types that I could count. Every boss encounter was a challenge except for 2 of them. And even the hunt mini bosses were a challenge at times due to the mobs that would also get thrown at you. The 5 dungeons are connected by the overworld which contains a few side quests, lots of hidden items to collect, and some of the mini bosses.

Another big plus is save points are right where you need them just before a boss. The music is good, the art is SUPERB. The combat is quick paced. The story is so-so. The lore is excellent. Creepiness and jump factor is definitely in high in there. 

The few janky or bad things about the game are quite minor. From using healing items and spell use if you get hit you can get cancelled (normal in many other games).

But what about getting started?  So for a game created by just two guys, I'm STUNNED at how well done it is and this is brought across early when, aside from adopting standard controls, getting them communicated is so well done.  

So let's talk about gameplay.  Like many city builders, you know you're going to need resources, housing, farming, etc...and this is all present in Fabledom, but you also must maintain relationships with other kingdoms.  I have found there might be a balance or AI issue in that I am not getting enough focus on the most critical needs (wood, stone, building), and to that end it would be nice to see a few QOL changes like letting us know how each day is passing.  We don't get a clue as to if we're in Hour 1 or Hour 20 of any day.  And if you're waiting for taxes to arrive, that makes it difficult.

Another QOL would be I'd like to know if someone left or died.  I've seen my kingdom go from a max population to missing several citizens with no word to me that they're gone or why.  But hey, its Early Access.  All of this is to be expected.

135,136894845,1183800,"Take the modern X-COM games and Darkest Dungeon and mix them together in a pot. Next, boil it down quite shallowly to reduce it to the basics and evaporate any depth. What you get is this game. And a soup you will enjoy. Once. Or maybe half of once.

The mechanics are mostly sound, 
the gameplay is satisfying (for a bit), 
and it's reasonably difficult (at first). 
Good. 
But...
The only difficult part of the game is the start (once you upgrade stuff the difficulty drops off dramatically), 
the characters are way unbalanced (2 of the initial party can essentially carry a team, whereas other characters are super nuanced and difficult to strategize in general terms), 
most upgrade choices are obvious, 
unlocks become increasingly specific (they basically tie specific achievement-style accomplishments to unlocking stuff, which is problematic), 
and you will have seen basically everything this game has to offer in your first play-through (which is a problem for a procedurally-generated game). 
Also, the Darkest Dungeon-style hub stuff is incredibly shallow and you will just do the same stuff over and over, while the PTSD stuff is just ""don't let it happen"", because there's no mitigation of bad traits or, so far as I can tell, good traits you can get (in my first play my overwatch sniper got stressed out by being near my auto-reload bot due to a malus, which really messed with my main strategy, and there was nothing I could do about it beyond eventuallyt increasing the bot's range and hoping there was cover further out, or just eating the stress of them being next to each other). You just don't want it to occur. At best it will be a mixed blessing.
And the game just goes on too long for the content available. 
Bad.

There is ostensibly replay value with unlocking characters and such, but I had grown tired of the formula by about 1/2 to 2/3rds of the way through my first game, so that's a bit of a waste.

The game is probably a 5/10. It's fine. Even fun for a while. But there's nothing to keep you interested for long. 15$ is the price, and that's probably about right. I finished my first playthrough in... 7 hours? Then I messed around for another few trying other characters and stuff, but given the lack of character balance I just wanted my original multi-kill melee and multi-kill sniper back, and given the lack of  variety, I really didn't want to just go through the incredibly basic loop again for many hours. 
The game has excellent bones, but it's basically a skeleton. There is almost no meat, and the meat it does have is just one meaty meal and then soup for the rest of the week.
If a playthrough took 2-3 hours instead of 7-8, and they added some mission variance beyond the 2 set pieces and the one optional and occasional ""blow up a thing"" category it could be quite good. The game basically needs more in less time. Halfway through the first play you'll have seen everything, but not have experienced any of the character or bot variations. By the end you might not want to start over because it's just the same fights and run to the door missions over and over and over. The camp phase is also basically just rote ""this is the obvious thing"" which later turns into ""these are the only useful things"". 


Also, just a personal thing - I find the use of ""punk"" as a suffix for made-up genres or non-genres lazy and irritating. The cyberpunk genre had that title for a reason - high tech, low life. It was named that because it evoked the punk ethos of the 70s. Just calling a thing ""blank-punk"" doesn't mean anything, and it bothers me that lazy people have just started genre-ing or specific-titling things ""blank-punk"" as shorthand for ""level or source of technology.... .. .. .. . .... . punk"". 
Also also, Verminfall is basically just ""so you know that game Vermintide? How can we steal that idea without anyone calling us out on directly yoinking it?"". Maybe try even a little?
Also also also, beyond the initial two problems I have with the title of this game, I have a third one. Why does seemingly every game these days have to have a sub-title? Either of the two words of this game's title are sufficient for a title. It doesn't need both.
I don't know if any of that last personal complainy bit is actually relevant, but I do think it reveals to some degree the effort put into this game. It's fairly by the numbers, doesn't do anything particularly interesting, and takes some clear shortcuts that send the mechanics out of the deep end and into the kiddy pool. It's fine, and probably worth playing once, but you're not going to be telling your friends to go out and get it, or returning to it in a couple months or years. It's a middle-of-the-road game that might entertain you by being something new, but you can play either of the games it apes for dozens of hours and be consistently challenged, satisfied, and messing around with nuances of strategy. You'll be lucky to get 10 solidly engaging hours of this game.

Honestly, it's a coin-flip on recommending this game. My actual review is ""5/10, average, neutral"" If it cost any more than it does I would definitely tell people not to buy it. As it stands, though, my basic take-away is ""if you've got 15$ to spare buy it knowing you'll play it once over a day or two. If that sentence bothers you save your money for a more replayable game"".",0.0

138,136887643,1183800,"So I have played through the campaign twice now, first ended due to a weird bug on chapter 2 but I didn't let this stop me! This game feels a lot like XCOM with the high stress missions. Every second of your time getting to the bunker feels like you're on the edge waiting for the next engagement. A few other reviews have said the same, finding a balance of knowing when to push ahead or stay and fight is key. IF you move to slow, you can find yourself overwhelmed.. BUT what if you push ahead to fast? You may find yourself in to many engagement and overwhelmed still. 

If I had one complaint it is that some characters feel like they don't pull as much weight as others. I just finished a play-through with the fencer and by the end he felt like he would get a few one off kills, and his main help to the team was with his bunker skill. Now why is this a complaint? Characters like Tilly and Gideon scale so quickly after a few upgrades and skills they can solo clear most waves on their own. Then you have characters who feel just right like Silas that is strong, but not so crazy as his skills limit him with Stress so it's a fun game of ""do I use them now? Or will I need him to have extra AP later in the mission?""

Ill will doesn't break any new ground or anything it does the old school retro fps the correct way. 
1) Awesome level design - Levels that are not only cool to look at but are fun to explore and not once did i ever get lost or frustrated when playing them. 
2) Enemies and their variety - Enemies in any video game have to balanced and fun to kill and the ones in ILL will are just that. Sure most people will recognise these enemies are homages to the ones you've seen in doom and tons of other fps. But these work just like the enemies in doom offering a brutal yet fun challenge 
3) Weapon Roster - shotguns, fish launcher, laser beam gun, rocket launcher, weapon no7 which i call the headache gun lol super shotgun assault rilfe etc. yeah all standard but still very fun to use and each weapon is never useless they all serve a particular purpose for a specific enemy which is very cool 
4) Game Length - Hard skill took me just over 4hrs not bad but ive played so many fps games and for $30 aussie dollars thats not bad
5) The music = omg the best part of the game the soundtrack is amazing and each level has its own theme and music that blend so well together. The game alone is worth it to hear the music. 

Conclusion: Thats about it really ILL WILL is a cool old school throw back shooter that uses unreal 4 to make everyone look like quake 3 well thats the vibes i got. Its a blend of doom, quake and serious sam with a crazy feeling added to the mix you will know what i mean when the play the later levels :)

157,136918008,"1798010,1798020","It is both very easy and very hard to recommend this game (as well as Vol. 2)

These games are my childhood, and while I didn't realize they were proper deck builder games as a child, I now consider them possibly the best deck building games from the GBA/DS (and that's while I had also played Yugioh & Duel Master games on it, which were often also great).

These are great deck builder games for their time, and still decent today. You've likely never seen any other games with this formula of Action Shooter + Deckbuilder, unless you've played ""One Step from Eden"" which heavily draws inspiration from this series (as well as the roguelite elements from Slay the Spire).

So why do I find it so hard to recommend:

Denuvo. 

As someone who has played them on the original system, and is now playing them on a much better system, I can tell you that it's far less responsive then I remember, and all I can think of is that Denuvo is delaying player input due to the active encrypting and decrypting of data as it's needed. So either Denuvo is screwing my input timing and causing it to feel like I'm Anchored with chips that didn't used to feel that way in the past, or they did a terrible job of porting the game.

What baffles me, is why they felt the need to put Denuvo on a rerelease of a series that has all the emulator ROMs still out in the wild... I don't condone piracy, but these games have long since been lost to the seven seas, so why even bother having an anti-piracy program that's basically a rootkit on it?

I hope they remove it, and I avoided pre-ordering this series because of it, but the chance to relive my childhood was too strong of a pull, and I caved.

Remove Denuvo, and this game becomes perfect, or at least reveals the need of updates to fix errors in porting it.

Denuvo might ""claim"" that their product doesn't put strain on processing/slow down the program, but that can only be a lie. You basically kill off hyperthreading if you can't queue up the next bit of data because it has to be decrypted still, which by itself is enough to create a noticable slowdown.

9/10 for the whole series... 0/10 for Denuvo as a program. It actually manages to slow down a GBA era game, on a Ryzen 3600 + RX 6600 + 32GB DDR4 RAM. Heck, wasn't the GBA single core?",1.0

213,15529814,226620,"Nice puzzle game, in dungeon crawler RPG form. 

You start each dungeon at level 1, and the goal is to power up enough to kill the boss. But you have limited resources. You only heal by exploring unexplored tiles or leveling up (or chugging potions), and you only level up by killing things (which usually depletes health and/or mana). And monsters and items don't respawn or anything like that. So you have to be smart about how you go about killing things, and in what order, and so on.

You can also unlock new classes and starter items and such to take into the various dungeons, and there are special challenge dungeons, and some tightly calibrated puzzle levels. It's pretty engaging overall. Made me late to class because I lost track of time.

Also the music in the dungeons is pretty great. 

And the tutorial system is extremely well done. It throws you right into a dungeon that's designed to teach you how to play as you go, without any explicit instructions. And then once you complete it (or, I bet, if you die), it gives you the option to continue on to the rest of the game or to go into some actual hand-holding tutorial levels with explicit instruction.",1.0

Anyway, the second video (with the gnome wizard runthrough) does a decent job of showcasing game mechanics. Your goal is to explore a randomly-generated dungeon and ultimately to defeat a high-level boss monster. To beat the boss, you'll need to have leveled efficiently. This (usually) includes killing the highest-level monster that you can at any given time, since you get bonus XP for killing a monster whose level is higher than your own. 

That's pretty much the core of what makes Desktop Dungeons interesting: you're always trying to beat a tougher monster. The way you do this varies tremendously; there's a long list of things that can help or hurt you, and you have to deal with whichever ones happen to be in the dungeon you're exploring. It's this variation that keeps the game interesting hours later.

I also really liked the mixture of strategy and luck, which makes this game unpredictable as well as mentally challenging. The puzzle levels which are also more or less randomly generated set very strategic stages, which you can spend easily a few hours on to crack one.

241,136911891,1681060,"[h1] EXOGATE INITIATIVE – Not Recommended... Yet | Early Access Review [/h1] 

[b] Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mazkYe-exWc [/b] 

Exogate Initiative is a fun if occasionally frustrating management/base-building hybrid that gives you control of an international for-profit space exploration operation that’s tasked with exploring and exploiting the universe via instant-transmission portals called (you guessed it!) exogates.  

Now, of all the sims I’ve ever sim’d, Exogate Initiative is... certainly one of them. That's not to say this game is bad—far from it, in fact, as I mostly enjoyed my ten+ hour dive into this title’s Early Access offerings. However, as of recording and as you’d expect of any Early Access release, Exogate Initiative currently lacks a good bit of polish, balance, and an “x-factor” that would make it worth the time of folks that aren’t already fans of the genre. But! If you, like me, enjoy sci-fi and simulators, then stick around, because Exogate Initiative hits most of the highs of the genre (and a few of the lows). 

You’ll begin your operation by excavating a large underground area using a fleet of autonomous robot slaves I mean workers, and I never grew tired of listening to their playful little beeps and chirps (which, in hindsight, might have been them crying out for liberation). Assuming you picked “Initiation” mode instead of “Freeplay,” you’ll then begin working through a long list of objectives delegated to you by the ever mysterious, always greedy, and probably nefarious Committee. These objectives slowly introduce you to each of Exogate Initiative’s classes or “Gaters” from scientist to soldier to scholar, and you’ll need to run recruitment campaigns, shuffle through applications, select the least shi*ty candidates, and then assemble teams before sending those suckers through the exogate, all in the name of profit! 

Each exoplanet you discover and assemble into your power-hungry grid of universal domination presents its own set of risks and rewards, from environmental hazards to alien artifacts to rare metals to outright hostile alien @ssholes called SQARBS who will occasionally invade your base, knock out your worthless soldiers, blow up a handful of generators, and peace the f**k out. And if you can’t tell, yes, I hate sqarbs.  

During missions, your teams will occasionally radio you with short, choose-your-own adventures that require selecting from a handful of (usually) easy-to-choose options. This feature can be disabled, but I found these interactions to be pleasant if forgettable interludes from the otherwise crushing weight of team composition micromanagement that Exogate Initiative often forces upon you. That’s right, despite automating much of the grunt work (like restocking vending machines and maintaining generators), Exogate still necessitates near constant vigilance, whether it’s monitoring when to sell rare metals on the marketplace, telling your scientists to write new patents, tending to your Gaters never-ending physical and psychological needs, and starting new missions. 

At its best, this gameplay loop is satisfying and addictive. At its worst, you can find yourself stuck in a horrifying downward spiral of injuries that require medical attention, but your medics hate working and when they do they become depressed, thereby necessitating the hiring of new medics to cure the old ones until the new ones invent new ways to not work. And, because you can’t make anyone do anything in Exogate Initiative (i.e., you can’t click tell the depressed medic to go get his own happy pills), you’re pretty much at the mercy of the semi-shitty AI to right this sinking ship. This injury spiral can make it impossible to field healthy teams for new missions which are required to fund your initiative, meaning you might get stuck in budget hell like I did and have to reload saves from an hour ago to figure out where things went wrong. It’s by no means broken, but Exogate Initiative will need significant balancing between now and full release if it’s to become a title worth recommending. Oh, and while the devs are at it, a little polish on these often janky, clipping-prone animations and perhaps a complete overhaul of the hilariously bad Gater faces would be a nice touch. 

Until then, I’m giving Exogate Initiative a subject-to-change aggregate MEGA score of 2.91/5 (full scoring breakdown in video, from “Plot” to “Sound”), and I'll give a quick shoutout to the game’s calm yet curious synth score that does a nice job of building atmosphere.  

Thanks for reading!

281,136918933,1457080,"Really enjoying this so far! Performance is great, haven't run into any bugs or issues. Took a few missions to get used to combat, felt clunky at first until I realized that I need to stop mashing the buttons like I would if I were playing dead cells. Love the way you can switch out outlaws to get new combos, and the strategy of hopping back and forth to steal different spells to use them on other enemies that are weak to that element is really fun. Makes me play a bit more strategically, and it feels great to dart around and pull off sweet combos. The side characters are fun and well written. Not as story rich and intense as The Ruined King, but that's not a bad thing, just a different flavor. I really enjoy the world of Runeterra, but can't stand playing league anymore, so these other games in the same universe are always such a treat!

It's linear with some side quests, spawns seem pretty consistent. If you're looking for a rouge-lite you should go elsewhere, but this is still really fun all the same. Save screen says that after about an hour and a half on normal difficulty I'm 25% of the way through, so I'm predicting this will be shorter than I want it to. Bosses and enemies are designed really well though, so there's no tedious grind just to pad out the run time. I fully expect to be doing at least one more complete playthrough on hard mode once I beat this one.

Wish there was a way to upgrade from the standard edition to the deluxe rather than just buying each DLC individually. You don't interact with your hut much, so the cosmetics there are kinda meh. Spells look cool but there are a bunch of nifty ones in game so I'm not sure if it's worth the $6. I'd say these are more of a ""if you like the game support the devs"" kind of DLC rather than something that adds a ton to the game. Not my cup of tea but I'm not offended that they exist.",1.0

but it's pretty darn close

It's a base builder with science. But fear not, it's like someone took dungeon keeper or evil genius and combined it with stargate. Which is actually cool and a great idea.

Do you know how long i've wanted a stargate strategy game? The only problem here is it doesn't seem too focused on war or battles. Hopefully that changes. I know it's supposed to be science and exploration but the one thing I really wanted out of stargate was more war and battles. I don't want that to be the main focus. Keep it science and exploration. But it would be super cool if the devs added in some kind of simulated combat stuff with aliens. I mean they give you soldiers right? So why not give us a bit more. THis is the kinda feedback we need to give them.

But you're not here for that, you wanna know if this game is worth it? Is it worth it's asking price? Yes!

Does it have potential? Yes!

It's a really good fun game that's really well designed. And being in early access means it's only gonna get better. I just hope they don't raise the price beyond 25$. I feel like at most it's worth 30. Even when it's finished. But still the game's really fun and really well done so far and I hope they keep up the good work.

It looks pretty good, it feels pretty good, it's got amazing gameplay with lots of innovation (not gonna spoil what kinds) and overall it's a great starting point.

I would rather have a beat em all type of gameplay or a full-on tactical game but the mix of both doesn't work quite as well as I had hoped. Basically as soon as you have sent your units where you want you just mash the sword attack (which is way too strong for its own good) and can clear almost any mob on your own repeating the same attack over and over.

Again the concept is cute on paper, but the execution feels too shallow for the more hardcore crowd and I could see the game being way too complex to control for kids.",0.0

373,66012238,1216320,"For me this wasn't something I enjoyed. Sure seeing little white blobs of pixels with Roman armor getting smashed and spewing colored balls of pixel blood seems like fun; but after running back and forth for 15-20 minutes trying to defend your flags and take flags from other pixelated armored blobs its gets super old.

I saw a video online and thought it would be a nice small game but its not what I was expecting; the game play is extremely repetitious and just doesn't fit with what I am looking for in a game. 

 [b] Views [/b] : When you are looking to play something like this the default view is extremely limiting and I found no options for getting out of the back of my commanders head and being able to see the field without coming down right over the top of his head with my mouse view. 

[b]Controls[/b]: Super simple and easy to get used to; this is probably the best part of the game by far. Not a whole lot to say other than that.

[b]Gameplay[/b]: If you are what I call a ""twitchy"" gamer that likes constant button clicks on your mouse then go ahead and spend the money. Otherwise its not worth it. I would not really call this a strategy game; even though there is a little bit of it in there. You get gold from taking flags and you get experience points from fighting but you are limited on the XP due to the flag that your standard bearer carries; but the XP you gain does stack up and helps you win battles or get gold quicker. The AI is extremely incompetent and they follow you nilly willy back into the range of your defending units on your fort and just get slaughtered when you turn around and attack with your troops because they are focused on your infantry and not saving themselves. The same can be said for your troops when you are attacking a fort. They have no code that allows them to loose confidence and retreat unless you tell them to. 

[b]Conclusion[/b]: In short don't spend your money unless you are just looking for something to add to the Steam collection that will let you spend 30 minutes running around like a pinball and spending the gold that you get from taking flags.",0.0

Besides that though. the game is fun with its use of strategic playtime on the enemies within said game,  especially when it comes to both attacking and defence. It makes you understand the power your troops can muster for an attack and takeover of an enemy base, and how many troops can you use to defend a position and move on to attack another enemy base. Personally I just love how can hold your mini army in the background to wait for the enemies to fight each other then swoop in and claim the flag.

My one suggestion is that more diverse units be added, with different strengths and weaknesses, to add a more tactical level to the combat. As it stands, the combat is just a mosh pit which, while fun for a while, gets very repetitive later into the missions. Adding units such as Triarii who may have more armor but do less damage, or Velites who would have less armor but more pilum, would go a long way towards making the combat more diverse and enjoyable.

this is a game where you can just spend some time having fun, minimal thinking and enjoying all the while.
also being Caesar + killing barbarians = instant like

the game does have some bugs and glitches here and there, nevertheless a great game. considering its early access no problem, and the cost is perfect.
another note: going through the discussions one can see that the developer is respectful. least of it one can see he is direct and not lying + after the game was released with a glitch, he reverted back, solved it, then updated. two tiny updates later we're fully enjoying it and in addition to that, he apologized. respect",1.0

395,136918827,1183800,"about 1/2 way though first run, and it seems pretty good. as usual for these games, there seems to be some balance issues that manifest as you progress, where if you're doing well you can snowball, but if you're doing poorly you'll be unable to recover. this might not be so bad, but it feels like the runs are too long, and too unforgiving of single mistakes, with no undo or retry. that said i've been lucky in this run and didn't make too many mistakes, so i'm more on the snowball side right now. but every move on every level makes me worry i might get owned by some unpredictable mechanic i haven't seen yet or some random event.

maybe there's actually enough 'cushion' to prevent unfair-feeling game-overs, but since i haven't had to use them yet i'm not sure. i'm playing on normal+ (normal, but i didn't do the tutorial, since i did it in demo, which it turns out makes you miss out on some achievements/unlocks). it felt balanced for the first 5 or so missions, but now seems too easy.

my nit-pick list so far:
- missing out on achievements/unlocks if you skip tutorial, feels like a bug.
- can't see list of possible achievements in run?
- can't predict when/where reinforcements arrive, and it's a bit unclear what they can do on the 'arrival turn' (i think it's just a normal turn for them). in other games (e.g. into the breach), there's some kind of 1-turn warning or the like, and it's more predictable. i kinda got a 'feel' for when+where new rats would show up as i went, but i think it would be more fun if it was a bit more explicit (i.e. you 'hear warning noises' from one of the spawn edges and it's marked in flashing red or something).
- similarly, it's hard to predict where 'hidden' enemies are, at least initially. and it seems that a big part of being successful is triggering enemy groups, at the right time, from the right place. again, i got a feel for this as i went along, but i'm not sure the risk/reward/fun trade-off is exactly right. feels like it needs some kind of enemy-just-discovered mechanic/warning, and maybe a way to predict/preview what areas will be triggered/uncovered/newly-seen *before* committing to a move (i.e. like overwatch shows you a preview of the target-able squares).
- can't tell the ranges or types of enemies too clearly. i think it would be better to know the attack range (not just movement range) of enemies.
- even 15 missions in, i'm not sure i understand how range for my own guns works. is it different in overwatch? it's always 8 units? i just kinda guess and  it seems to usually be okay somehow.
- runs/missions both feel a bit too long to me.

anyway, despite the above issues it feels 'polished enough' for me to recommend, although it might be rough if you're not familiar with the genre. i'm not sure if i'll do a second run, at least not right away, but i'm getting enough out of one run to be content.",1.0

409,136921404,1851030,"Ignore the low playtime; I spent a long time with the press demo before release and meant to get this out earlier. I purchased the full game to confirm criticisms were still applicable to the final product.

God of Rock is a visually frustrating game that fails to adequately represent either of the genres it's mashing together, but could easily be a mainstay in the genre if the UI was overhauled and the control scheme revisited.

For fighting game players thinking this could be a good addition to your local, you'll be disappointed by a lack of button binding at character select and the bindings themselves being confusing. On a traditional stick you're missing out on a second hand's worth of rhythm buttons, which are crucial for jacks in higher difficulty songs. On a leverless controller, you have to rebind your Dpad to joystick inputs - except the inputs are labelled, for some bizarre reason, as ""Up/Down"" and ""Up/Down (2)"". Which one is 'up'? Why are there two of these? Does it matter? Why can you bind two buttons for each of the directions? The obvious intended method of playing this is on a pad like a DS4, but those aren't always available - and I'll bet most people at locals don't want to switch to a regular controller just to play this.
The motion inputs are, speaking as a fighting game player, unnecessary for this game. I get the difficulty stems from pulling off 360s and QCFs while not dropping your rhythm combo, but it's just a needless layer of complexity. Pairing a non-rhythmic mechanical task with a rhythmic one is just... jarring. It's like typing a review with one hand and pulling off the TTFAF guitar solo with the other. I can't believe I'm saying this, but one-button specials would be tremendously helpful here.

The actual mechanics of fighting are simple enough; you have a health bar, and specials from yourself and your opponent will manipulate that health bar. Doing a higher level special move than your opponent at the same time they do will cancel theirs out, and this can chain up until the highest level, meaning you can't just mindlessly churn them out. Succeeding at the rhythm game gives you meter to perform these specials; the core loop is to score high combos, use the meter you build to go on the attack, and to make sure you're never starved for specials to counter their offense. Characters vary from the self-healing Hilda to the stance-focused Kosaku, and they're genuinely interesting. If this was a game that was easy to bring to locals and to get people set up, it'd be a fun side game.

While we're on that point, let's talk about the characters. The designs are fun! Many of the characters are obvious homages to rock legends, like Ziggy the Starman paying tribute to David Bowie's stage persona Ziggy Stardust or the obvious Elvis recreation King. Champ's just a buff shirtless Freddie Mercury and I'm extremely here for it. The cast is diverse, and hot-shot VAs like Kira Buckland (Hilde) and Jeff Williams (King) bring them to life. I genuinely want to see more of them! Edith's grayscale color palette is a nice bit of visual flair, and the God of Rock looks straight out of a guitar hero game. These characters would kick ass in a traditional fighting game, and there's already a nice foundation - heck, they even beat each other up on screen with each hit note. They're excellent, and easily one of the best parts of the game.
The game's visual flair is excellent, too, outside of the gameplay portions. I love the graffiti-esque stylings of the menus, the way portraits at character select look like they were spray-painted onto a wall. Song select is framed like you're picking out a single from an album. It wants an aesthetic, and it hits it. The game's a visual treat when you're not playing it.

Rhythm game players, I'm so sorry - it's a four-button horizontal-scroller. There's a reason most rhythm games are vertical scrollers, and that's to provide an easy analogue for which button is which note; notes fall onto your buttons. The vertical layout of the note icons/judgement line is confusing, and while it's learnable, it's annoying that there's no option to rotate it. I found myself craning my head 90 degrees to simulate a downscroll, and left my play sessions with neck pain. The chart itself takes up a tiny portion of the screen, and while most of the relevant information is clustered there - your special gauges and your EX meter, for instance - your health is for whatever reason all the way in the top corners. Having to dart your vision between the chart and the opposite side of the screen is disorienting, which makes it difficult to judge the state of the match. What's your life lead? Should you cash in and try to take out the last scrap of their health bar? The nature of rhythm games discourages you from looking away from the chart, but the HUD almost forces you to. This is especially pronounced when playing a character like Hilde, who self-heals; did your hard-earned 15 heal stacks actually just do anything? Drop your combo and find out, idiot.
The soundtrack is good, though. It won't be to everyone's tastes, but I like it. 'Embers' is a particular favorite.

Most of the screen seems to be dedicated toward showcasing the characters; they clash in the center as you and your opponent duke it out. The animation is good, the designs are good, but good god the VFX is overwhelming. If you're both doing well, then each blocked strike from the on-screen avatars sends out a blur and a flash of light. Consider that this means every hit note means there's a bright flash from off of the chart. Most rhythm games have some option or another to dim or disable non-chart elements for focus's sake, but God of Rock doesn't offer that. The visual flair for spectators seems to be prioritized over the experience of the players. Considering the giant wheel in the bottom-center of the screen showing what specials are being used, I can't imagine why it wouldn't be an option.
I experienced more than a few charts that weren't synced, but that could've been a calibration problem. YMMV.

God of Rock has a solid foundation. I really, really want this game to be good - we need more experimental games like this, and it knows what it's trying to do. I'm just not sure God of Rock knows how to do it. The team at Modus Games seems to really adore the project, so I'm 100% sure they'll bring it around within a year or so, but as-is on launch day I can't recommend it.",0.0

423,136921660,226620,"In addition to being a wonderfully addictive little puzzle game with an RPG theme and lots of interesting unlocks, Desktop Dungeons deserves special mention for being the game that's not entirely dissimilar from all those terrible online ads you see for mobile RPGs where it looks like the hero has a number and needs to attack enemies with a smaller number but oops attacks enemies with a bigger number and fails, guess you should click on the game to try since you'd do better, but then if you actually click on any of them, the game is nothing like that whatsoever. 

Desktop Dungeons still isn't exactly like that -- you can kill enemies with higher numbers given the right gear or skills, and enemies with lower numbers can kill you with the right special abilities (not to mention, there's a lot more going on here in terms of exploration and healing and mana management) -- but it's still a damned sight closer than all those fake games advertising number murder gameplay.

Engagements probably get a little boring after a while since it's always the same enemies, also because out of all the weapons available i only used 2 (tyrant that does 30 and shadow claws that deal 15) so i believe other weapons need some tweaks otherwise you're putting yourself at a disadvantage by using them (regular swords/claws do 10 damage which isn't enough to 1shot the small purple dudes, becoming VERY annoying while fighting Mother).

Another thing i didn't particularly like is the fact i had to wander for a soling 1 hour and a half after defeating the first boss because i had 0 idea where to go since they told me the places i had to head to but didn't know how to get there, so it felt like i was exploring parts of the map i wasn't supposed to be in.

Most darkness powers are useless besides 1 or 2, so giving a small tweak to those could probably help aswell (the game is very fast paced and having a 40 second cooldown on an ability when theres another that does the same job but has 12 seconds is nonsense).

The game might be capable of running on mobile devices, thanks to it being developed with Gameloft, but it takes full advantage of PC and Steam Deck graphics.

Sound Track rocks, the graphics are awesome and it's complete mayhem

On Steam Deck it works out of the box, both offline and online, with 50-60 FPS online multiplayer.

The game feels really good in general to play, i think it has a ton of potential. the music slaps so hard for what this game is, and overall it has been a fun kart racer and probably the best one we've ever gotten on PC 

however 

the free to play stuff is already pretty gross and it hasn't even started yet 
im talking like 6 currencies already all with suspiciously looking icons in what i imagine is an attempt to confuse the player. 

it forces you to pick your Free Racer Immediately before having any idea how they handle or abilities or anything of the sort i only drove as Micky for a Control tutorial before being forced to choose and if you try and back out of that menu it will automatically pick the first choice without any option to save it for later, them actually not even mentioning what kind of racer Micky is and then having you pick a class immediately one being identical to the starter, again kinda gross. 

then you have crew members to level up, team members to level, all with varying degrees of currency or items. the characters in party don't all work together so you have to pick them in theme to the overall character which for them literally being just an icon and no real modeled character seems a bit silly. this maybe their limiter on breaking the game with purchases and funds but i don't know that most of these should really be in here at all. 

for a minimum of $30 to start i don't think you really get a whole lot of anything and being forced to use the one item you get as soon as you get to the first menu is pretty upsetting, and i think you get the ""Golden Pass"" which i believe is the battle pass considering the bones here are really solid though the sense of speed could be better. which that may work itself out the higher you Level yourself or character.",1.0

495,136925816,1976950,"Not a true review, but a big kudos to QCF for giving this sequel out to players of the original.  Super classy move, guys.  Big thank you!

As for the game, if you've played the OG Desktop Dungeons, you'll be extremely familiar with the mechanics of the game.  The graphics got a very obvious overhaul - for better or for worse - but the gameplay remains exactly the same, offering players new and old the same plate of tactical deliciousness that the original had.  If it bites you, you'll find yourself spending countless hours clicking away at this brain-teaser of a dungeon crawler.

But that doesn't tell you much, so let's just go over exactly what this is - it's a tile-based dungeon crawler that is made for bite-sized runs.  Play it for 20 minutes or for several hours at a time, the randomly-generated dungeons ensure there's plenty of replayability and the town building/upgrading will keep you diving for treasure.  Unlike other tile-based crawlers, instead of being an omniscient overseer of the map, you have an avatar and how/when you move/attack is vital to the way the game works. Exploring undiscovered tiles heals you and replenishes your mana, but every step you take away from an enemy you've damaged means they'll be healing (enemies never move, but ignoring them is usually temporary at best).  There are all sorts of spells and other ways to mitigate this to allow you to tactically run from a fight and return to it with less penalties, but dungeon crawling is a delicate balance of tactical decisions you'll need to make rather than being full-on risk/reward.

It looks like there are several new classes to play with along with a few new races (each combo giving you a different set of bonuses or abilities for your run) and though I've barely scratched at this, I'm sure the mind-bending puzzles also make a return.  The inventory system and the info panels also got a makeover - again, for better or for worse - and I haven't yet discovered all of the changes made here yet.  Though I do have to note that you can no longer long-click to access your glyphs which is a bit annoying.

At first blush, the game feels bigger somehow, but the change to a new engine makes it feel less like a desktop distraction (like the OG game or the old LucasArts Desktop Adventures games... member those?) and more like a fully-fledged game.  Not a big deal, but a lot of my time with the original was spent multitasking and you can always run this in a window for the same effect.  Either way, the dungeons seem to have a larger scope than before with more room to plan out your approach than before and plenty of opportunities for converting glyphs where the original felt super tight on that front.  Maybe it'll get tighter with more time under my belt.

At any rate, I'm pleased that the devs didn't try to reinvent the wheel here.  They expanded the original rather than modernizing it which is telling me they know exactly why people played the first game to begin with.  To me it feels like they're bringing it ten years into the future and not mucking with the formula.  ""Modern audiences"" can go somewhere else.",1.0
496,136925161,1976950,"Pretty solid remaster of the Desktop Dungeons. There is some roughness in UI here and there by now, but core game mechanics are polished and balanced. The devs removed all the  'I'll wait until it is  done with autoexloring' thing of classic roguelikes, so no more grinding and searching for weaker enemies. You'll search for stronger enemies instead. The game leans more towards chess/puzzle side of the genre and it is a big fat plus.

I poured hours into the free beta in 2010, picked up the Enhanced Edition in 2013 (and mostly played on my tablet). I always wondered what QCF was up to after Enhanced came out and then I saw this pop up during one of the Steam Next fests. I was not expecting to get this for free, but if you owned the Desktop Dungeons Enhanced Edition before today, you should already have this in your Steam Library. 

I was extremely excited by the prospect of more Desktop Dungeons. I wasn't expecting that my original Enhanced Edition save would transfer over to the new game. That's some real dedication. 

Desktop Dungeons is one of the first coffee break/puzzle roguelikes I ever played. Its charming and simple art style hides a pretty nefarious and deep system once you start digging into it. I don't have the time to dig into the details right now (and honestly, it's more fun to figure out how to get some bonus XP by killing monsters that are higher level than you are on your own). The different class and character combinations can yield some really fun gameplay, but the real fun is when you start experimenting with worshipping different gods and finding out how to play to their strengths.

Desktop Dungeons Enhanced Edition is free on Steam if you want to check the game out for yourself. Rewind adds some quality of life changes and 3D graphics (among other things). If you like things like Golden Krone Hotel or Tactical Nexus, I bet you'll have a great time with Desktop Dungeons.",1.0

The game's essentially an Evil Genius light light light, with most management mechanics replaced in favour of spamming exploration missions. Unfortunately, the pacing forces you into simply mindlessly throwing your teams into the fray, Missions aren't very interesting, as there's no scouting or preparation or anything like that. They're essentially just click, spam, go. 

Sometimes a mission will result in a little vignette, but the writing in the ones I have  gotten to play so far (~30?) is bad to mediocre. The writers haven't really understood that just going ""ooooh mystery, eh? How about that?"" isn't really fun - it's just annoying. There's one larger plot with invading squids, which is also quite boring. A story needs to have a conclusion, come on!

The checks during missions are also somewhat opaque - it tells me the odds, but I don't really know what a failure does. Less XP?


It seems the game wants you to do a lot of team micromanaging, but the UI is actively hostile in making that happen. There's no team screen, you have to either create a team via the mission interface or via the HR screen. There's team compatibility, but you won't be shown this when making a team.

One major annoyance is teams simply not debarking. Often, this is due to teammates being in the hospital. You don't really get the luxury of having spares, but should you have some, you can swap out a team member. Often, however, the team will simply be stuck in opposite sleep/eating cycles, so that once one member is ready to go, the others are too hungry.

The game often wants you to use a person with x stat, but it won't tell you what stat the candidates have in that screen. 

Not to mention the inevitable EA jank, with soldiers not going on missions for ages etc.",0.0

Overall a nice addition to a the base management genre 
there is a lot of potential available for this game that I hope will be realized!

Pros: similar vibes to other games of it's type, the exotic setting will allow for a lot of plot expansion and it feels like there is a lot of room to expand into new mechanics should the devs decide to

the writing is quirky and appropriate for the different types of characters that are show cased

the art style and sound design are well done and seem rather polished for an early access title

Cons: current most egregious bug to me personally is a few pathing issues with the meeples, enemies and allies seem to have a chance to ignore built walls so be careful where you dig! 

There is a tutorial but it needs some more work on providing context, if you haven't played similar types of these games before you may be lost before looking up a Youtube video on how to proceed.

currently defending you base is more a balance of 'can i afford to rebuild my power network vs. can I afford to hire and keep enough guards to defend my power network' there isn't yet a lot of options beyond that. (no automated defenses that I had unlocked or could see in the tech tree)

in summary: 
the game is in early access and was just released. while there is a whole game, the gameplay experience feels like there is more on the horizon. If the concept of the game intrigues you I'd encourage you to vote with your wallet. Otherwise adding it to your wishlist and checking back in on it after it's had more time to bake would be a great idea too.",1.0

Combined with the absolutely insane decisions made when they designed the pvp matchmaking (something that's the make-or-break for the longevity of this game), this game clearly has some glaring issues that should not have been in there at launch.

Gameplay needs some work as ball movement is not always fluid - feels to me like an overabundance of special effects is the cause and think there is a game mode that shuts these off. The old tables play smoother in FX3 so don't bother purchase/importing them just keep both games installed and back up your FX3 install files. Now you have a display area for all those collectibles mastering a table rewards you with.

533,136929177,1183800,"Many games that are inspired by XCOM go astray in adding complicated mechanics that ultimately don't make the game more fun like tedious inventory micromanagement (phoenix point) or replacing % chance to hit with an energy system (phantom doctrine) or go the opposite direction and remove too many strategic options (empire of sin). This game strikes a great balance, I think, by feeling like its own experience that's less intense than XCOM but still difficult in its own way. 

You don't have the same risk of losing a soldier immediately as in XCOM because you can always revive a soldier as long as you have a stimpack, but if you continuously have soldiers bleed out, you will run out of medical supplies and get squeezed in future missions. I really like that the weapons are energy weapons and ""vent"" rather than reload, which gives you the option of firing without venting and doing huge damage at the risk of very likely doing major damage to yourself as well. Functionally it ends up being basically a reload but the flavor of being able to roll the dice on an overheating weapon is really cool.

The classes are very distinct and unique - though its worth noting that some are much stronger than others (which I think is OK since this is a rougelike). I think the art and sound effects are on point, too. Shots and even the venting mechanic are very satisfying.

I play quite a few games but wouldn't call myself a roguelike, twinstick or shoot em up expert by any means and was able to beat the final boss for the first time on my 4th run.

As you can guess, in my opinion the game is on the easy side and especially does not provide much challenge after you get the hang of the gameplay loop. The standard enemies are simple and alright. Bosses are quite easy, however they are ""relatively"" varied in their attacks and environment hazards. 

For its price I personally think it is a good value game if you have money to spare or are into the genre. This game however does not provide the complexity and/or depth alot of roguelike/roguelite fans look for nor does it provide endless hours of content. To be fair, at its current pricepoint this is hardly a issue worth arguing.

As a side note for the developer:
The game became uncompleteable on that first ""succesful"" run. When I beat the boss I suddenly lost all my remaining health, stayed alive and for some reason was able to go into the abyss without getting respawned, dying or completing the game, as a result I was forced to reset.

586,136931323,2328760,"As a pinball fan, and owner of TPA (The Pinball Arcade), and FX3, here is a fairly in depth comparison. While I certainly enjoyed FX3 with its unique tables and creations, there is no question many were incredibly easy with the floaty physics of the balls. Tables like Doom, while very fun, were almost impossible to lose. When it came to the reproductions of classic tables such as Williams, it usually fell short of TPA by a margin. The physics always felt off, and while it made for a fun pinball game, it fell quite short of a pinball simulation. This new Pinball FX claims improved physics and graphics, not to mention Ray Tracing, which can be hard for some hardware, though it runs pretty smoothly on my laptop and its 2080 Super. So what is best?

[b]Physics[/b]

Since this is a selling point, I compared all three for feel, but to avoid falling into personal biases, I brought up actual video recordings on YouTube and used them as a reference. Frankly, FX is the winner here, and it shows up in the reactions of the ball, but also small things like falling through the hole in a slide on Arabian Nights. TPA is not far behind in some tables but not all. Curiously, TPA actually has some off-flippers and angles of flippers on some tables. I had no idea of this until observing the genuine video footage. So a win for FX overall. TPA seems to have a lighter incline on all the tables so it is hard to know exactly, and I always found TPA very solid overall.

[b]Graphics[/b]

This is going to come as a surprise but while FX has the potential to be the clear best, its graphics and lighting need serious tweaking. The table lights (using [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY2pFjj1Phg]original Williams tables[/url] to compare) are overly bright, creating exaggerated shadows. Some tables have outright wrong colors such as Arabian Nights. The lights near the bumpers are white instead of the actual yellow, as well as those around the table. The overall result is a much colder color scheme than the real table. 
What about Ray Tracing? Frankly, it is a serious disappointment as implemented for now. Side-by-side screenshots with it on and off show that the only visible result is a sharp increase in contrast, so darker areas are darker, effectively making the lights brighter by comparison. However, multi-point shadows and reflections and light bouncing is non-existent. So all you really get with RT is a darker table with deeper shadows. At least with the simulated Williams tables.

[b]Variety[/b]

In terms of simulated tables of old, TPA has an overwhelming edge still, with many many classics such as Firepower I and II, High Speed, and others, but TPA is a dead end, and WYSISWYG. FX is clearly very much alive not only for original creations (I had a hoot with the Snoopy table), but new classics are also being added. I read another user complaining about a mistaken magnet in Addams, but I have not tried it and cannot comment.

[b]Perks[/b]

Much like its predecessor, FX has a ton of added effects, such as flying scores, special effects and more. These can all be tailored to taste so that your game experience, if using a classic table, will not be distracted by these. However, they are a nice touch, no arguments.

[b]Cost[/b]

This is a very personal thing, so I will refrain from passing judgement. If you had tables from FX3, then you get them at 50% off here. I don't know what the cost in the US is, as I live in Brazil, but the average for the tables or bundles has been between $3-6. YMMV.

[b]Verdict[/b]

Right now, it stands as the best overall pinball experience for new tables and pure physics, but there are definitely areas to improve such as fixing the RT so it actually does more than deepen shadows, as well as fix the colors of lights and the general brightness of them. This is the only serious complaint I have, but it detracts from the overall impression.

593,136930003,1649740,"This game definitely doesn't deserve it's mixed review. It's a pretty darn well made game that's held back by some clunkiness and QOL issues. Hunt the Night is a hardcore top down action rpg, imagine mixing the Legend of Zelda with Bloodborne's setting and Castlevania looking characters.  I won't beat around the bush, this game is tough as nails and you will die a lot, so if you're after a more casual romp, please turn around immediately. 

Combat is all right, it can be clunky and frustrating at times but it can also be exhilarating and very satisfying when you're weaving dashes in between melee attacks to then unload you guns onto the enemy before finishing it off with your dark magic, the bones are well structured, it just needed some more polish. Enemy variety could have also been better, especially since this game loves to throw you into wave gauntlets.

The game doesn't have a map, which can be annoying for some, who don't pay attention or talk to NPC's so they end up not knowing where to go next,  but there is an NPC in the game that will tell you which direction to go, so it's not really a big deal.  If anything Hunt the Night's biggest flaw is balance, which is probably the best flaw to have because it can be easily patched, the difficulty spike around mid game can be a bit too sadistic.

Overall Hunt the Night might not break any new grounds, but it melds together well tried formulas into an intriguing dark fantasy world filled with challenges to keep you coming back for more and conquer them once and for all. It has a few QOL and polish flaws here and there and I would say maybe wait for a balance patch down the line, but don't overlook this gem",1.0

It's good to have something you can pick up and blast through in a short time.

I am a sucker for this kind of art style, reminds me of Ed McMillen, or Behemoth.
This game is a short, simple, shmup roguelike. Super fast paced, a quick burst of addicting adrenaline.
And highly polished! I can't believe it was made in such a short time frame.

Collect upgrades with every level as you blast your way through the adorable enemies with insanely satisfying sound design. The pop of the cannisters is good EVERY TIME. The day/night switch is neat too, you have to think about your upgrades because most have a good and a bad side, one for day, one for night. The screen will be crowded by the end,
but you will be extremely OP. The boss is still a bit of a challenge though.

Some other things I like:
The colors really pop.
I love the arcade machine aesthetic.
I like how fast and breezy a playthrough is, literal minutes.

If you need a fun but chaotic afternoon pick me up, this game is great fun.

616,136932551,1976950,"Desktop Dungeons starts off you very simply. You click on squares you want to move to, click on enemies to attack them, click on glyphs to use them, enemies attack you only when you attack them, and explore to regenerate health and mana. Your ultimate goal is defeat the boss of each dungeon and the dungeons are relatively short. Just thirty minutes max for a dungeon if you take your time on some the harder ones. All this may deceive you into thinking Desktop Dungeons is a simple game. It is not. 

The difficulty curve in Desktop Dungeons is wonderfully done. At first the only mechanics you need to master are the ones I listed above. Then classes, kin, and various enemies are introduced that force you tackle them in a variety of ways. Some classes rely on glyphs to win and others struggle to use glyphs forcing you find alternative ways to win. Some enemies are nigh impervious to regular attacks and others attack back when you use magical attacks on them. The semi random nature of the game will force you into situations where you cannot use optimal combos to win. Sometimes you're playing a class that struggles to use magic against enemies that you need to attack with magic to kill. So after you master the basics of the game you then have to learn how to use the various classes optimally and what to do when you can't use them optimally. You get a feel for what enemies are easy in what situations and hard in others. You advance further into the game and suddenly you find dungeons and enemies where previous strategies don't work. Those enemies you could kill a few levels higher than you suddenly can't be killed that way anymore. You have to find out ever better ways of leveraging your bonuses. Finding ways to deal just a little more damage or take a little less so you can kill tougher enemies. You have to manage your resources even better. For someone brand new to the game each hurdle the game places in front of you can seem insurmountable at first glance. But the game does a fantastic job of pushing the player to be better without having them give up. All the simple systems in the game get combined in a wonderfully complex way that never feels impossible to understand because of how the game eases you into them. 

For people interested in the game but have never played it: make no mistake, this is very much a strategy/puzzle game. The later levels will require you to really sit down and use your brain to solve them. The game never goes so far as to require you to calculate stuff out in advance to win but it will require a fair amount of foresight instead of blindly doing whatever actions seem best at the time. 

For people who played or know about the original are checking out the remaster: there a great deal of small gameplay changes that all make the game better in my opinion. You can see if tiles have potions on them from the glow on adjacent tiles, the fighter class had a number of changes, and you can see enemies in the fog if you get close enough. These are just a few changes they made. The rewind feature is really nice. If the new perspective annoys you there is a button in the bottom left corner that gives you a full overview like in the original game. My only complaint is that the old artstyle is gone. The new 3d stuff is good but I adored the original art. 

Some last remarks for those who have read this far. The writing is very good and the humor in the game is very much in the same style as Terry Pratchet. The music is also great and very fitting for the feel of the game. My favorite track is Troll in A Minor if you want to look it up and give it a listen before buying the game. I should also mention that the devs were kind enough to give the remaster to everyone who bought the original game for free. A completely unnecessary gesture given how much work has gone into the remaster more than justifies the price. Although my opinion doesn't amount to much, I would like to finish by saying I think Desktop Dungeons is in the top 100 games ever made. I put it so low only because of how many amazing games have been made throughout history and not to say that Desktop Dungeons isn't THAT good. Every single part of the game is amazing well executed and the game's relative obscurity is mostly due to the genre's lack of popularity and not because the game has been found lacking.",1.0

621,136930860,1976950,"Desktop Dungeon is a phenomenal puzzle dungeon crawler that truly tests your strategic thinking skills. The game's retro-style graphics are charming and give a nod to classic dungeon crawler games of the past, but the gameplay is anything but old-fashioned.

The game offers a unique blend of RPG-style mechanics and puzzle elements that requires you to carefully plan out each move, considering the strengths and weaknesses of your character and the enemies you're facing. As you progress through the game, you'll unlock new characters, items, and abilities that add even more depth to the gameplay.

One of the standout features of Desktop Dungeon is its accessibility. The game is designed to be played in short, bite-sized sessions, which makes it perfect for busy gamers who don't have a lot of time to sink into lengthy gaming sessions. Plus, the game's intuitive interface and helpful tutorial make it easy for players of all experience levels to jump right in and start playing.

630,136930273,1457080,"Moonlighter is my favorite game and I now also love Mageseeker.

My expectations were high for this game but it even managed to exceed them.

The artstyle is gorgeous and really good for a pixel graphic game. 
The combat system is fun but also punishing, especially since I play it on the highest difficulty. Its definitely not even close to being as hard as souls-like games but you cant just brainlessly spam attacks either.

The game does the same as Moonlighter and Ruined King, it spreads little notes with lore around the map you can read. As someone who played all of Riots games this is truly a treat for me. The boss fights are really fun so far and it doesn't feel like some other hack and slash titles where they just throw enemies at you for the sake of it.

I also like how this game depicts Sylas as a character with a strong personality who doesnt seem likeable at all times and more like a hothead. I am expecting him to have a positive character change developing with the story and im excited to see how this game will manage to make him likeable :D

I camped for the game release and played almost non-stop till now and cant wait to play more the following days.

Due to the nature of it being in early development, it does lack content and has a couple bugs. A couple suggestions to make this game more enjoyable without over complicating it would be:

Content:
- multiplayer to trade with friends
- a cathedral (solely for the aesthetic purpose, could possibly boost happiness)
- being able to move a building without having to completely demolish it
- horses or carts to allow stockpilers to move resources more easily
- more decorations/having decorations improve happiness
- more events (such as the witch)
- a night cycle (could have unique events or limited jobs like a tavern?)
- being able to replant Bob
- a flower shop to use flowers and boost currency
- allowing the villagers to use the dice table (or at least see them interact with their environment)
- showing a range on storage such as the granary or stockpile (able to be toggled)
- being able to place decorations on top of pathing

Bugs of notice:
- the villagers consistently starve even when you have a surplus of food
- villagers constantly get stuck (this may be ""where is my body,"" but I am not sure)
- the pigs cannot be moved or killed so you have to build around them
- certain buildings will not demolish (such as the condo)

Overall, this game is 100% worth your money. My friend and I have an hour/dollar rule in which a game is worth it's money if you play for the amount of hours you spent on the game ($1=1hour).

The first winter is fine, you get a secret santa gift when you don't have enough supplies. After that though, your villagers die off from starvation despite the fact that there is food available or die from sickness, despite the fact that there is a hospital in their area (and the hospital is only at 2 out of 8 patients). What's the deal? That's kind of annoying honestly. 

I  restarted my game after I unlocked the hospital on the first one and tried to deleted buildings to make room for the hospital (and rebuild the buildings somewhere else) and made a huge mess of things, out of almost 90 villagers I killed all but one from starvation... oops. I do like the game, but it is in early access and has huge progress to be made. I have maxed out all the available content within 8 hours (not all of that actively playing).

649,136932710,1861090,"Fun free to play roguelike deckbuilder.

I love deckbuilding games and this was free, so I decided to try it out.  Game is easy to get into, and has a tutorial to explain the mechanics.  It plays like other deckbuilders, but has some unique aspects.  Instead of choosing a path, you are given card that represent enemies, shops, events, and treasure and have to assemble the path you want to take.  Each path ends with a miniboss and the third path ends in a boss fight.

You get two characters so far in the free version, one you start with and one you unlock.  Combat is well animated with pretty graphics.  Battles have you managing two different energies.  One for attacks and one for spells.  After beating an enemy you get an upgrade and about halfway through the second level, I was incredibly overpowered, and this snowballed to make the final level very easy.  The only issue was I had so many abilities that it would cause the game to lag each time I played a card, as it had to process all of the abilities triggered by the card.  This did lead to some lag spikes and once the game seemed to think I had ended my turn when I had not.

You can customize your character at the start by picking a god and zodiac sign.  These will made differences in your character, but I beat the game the first time I played it and I do not see a way to increase the difficulty.  This game could use that, because as it is, there is no reason to play again.  The game really should implement a scoring system so I could compete with my friends to see who can get a high score.

Controls are fine, it is easy to do starting boosts and drifting feels great.

Plenty to do for those who don't want to race with actual players such as unlocking parts to upgrade your favourite racers and mini missions to keep you going.
So for those worried it is P2W, so far I not really had issue leveling up any character and shop stuff is just minor colours or starter packs if you wanna give the character a jump-start in level or two but not needed at all to race and enjoy.

As for the tracks, I love them, some have added stuff to keep them fresh and their backward versions are enjoyable too, it took me a while to realise I was racing on some tracks backwards.

Lastly, the soundtrack is awesome, I can tell which franchise it is from and still love how they have remixed/made it more jumpy for the racing genre so look forward to getting the soundtrack when possible~

If you love racers I say give this one a shot even if just the standard version, otherwise you will have a fun game to look forward to when it comes F2P (said to be next year but who knows)

655,136934938,1976950,"I have about 730 hrs in the original and also did a bunch of playtesting for this remake. Desktop Dungeons is one of my favorite games of all time, and it's so great to have a remastered version for its 10-year anniversary.

IF YOU ARE NEW TO DESKTOP DUNGEONS: This is a no-brainer recommendation. This game, while simple on the surface, is strategically deep and very unique - nothing else quite scratches the itch for me. There is a learning curve, but it's worth it!

IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE GAME: First of all, you can import your old kingdom if you link your account, so no re-grinding! Second, while the game is mostly the same, there are a few very smart adjustments. The first thing you'll probably notice is the new dungeon layout that is better suited to widescreen resolutions. There are also tweaks to classes like Fighter and Berserker. And of course, there's the namesake Rewind feature.

Like me, you may be turned off by DD:R's UI at first. It is very, very different from the original. When you're used to seeing the entire dungeon at once, it feels jarring to start zoomed in. Instead of having the most important UI items clustered together on one side of the screen, they are spread out across the perimeter. But give it a chance - it grew on me, and I think it will grow on you too. It should definitely be an improvement for new players -  there are subtleties like enemies facing towards you when they will strike first, and combat prediction now extends to all status effects.

I have one major complaint: No custom keybindings. This is an accessibility issue, and it frankly is unacceptable that a remastered game released in 2023 lacks it. It should have been one of the core features. Hopefully it is implemented down the road.

Overall though, I'm so happy this game has gotten remastered. More than anything, I hope it brings in lots of new players and revitalizes the community!",1.0

662,136933367,1976950,"Disregard some of the negative reviews you see here; there has been a misinformation campaign pushed that the devs did not agree to nor advertise. 

IF you see negative reviews that complain about ""being lied to"", they were not. This is a revamp of the OG game. I own and have owned the OG game for quite a while, I playtested this game. Dev ran a promo that some devs do for people who own an OG copy of a game before a date (that's before today and before the OG one was put free for a promo). 

The smooth brained logic is ""Well, reddit said that I get both games for free since the OG one is free I want my free copy of this updated game that took hundreds upon hundreds of dev hours to code because it's free because reddit said it's free.""

No, this game is not free if you didn't own the OG one before the cut off date. It is on a discount, and for as chonky as the game is, the full price is worth it.

This says I only have .8 hours. That's false, I have far more across all iterations of the OG games elsewhere and playtested this one. 

What is this game? It's a roguelike puzzle-like that has dynamic elements which are more chaotic and does not have victory as an assurance with careful planning intermixed with a puzzle mode with set dungeons and set patterns that are totally mathematical and able to be beat.

If you played the OG one, but, for some reason don't own it on Steam, Rewind was built the way a remake/remaster should be done. It is 1:1 with the OG, while also adding stuff too, and the graphical upgrade is fantastic.

The game is set with a twisted sense of humor that, if you're one of the now endangered species of folk like I feign to be, and have that dwindling and more rare per day due to reddit and facebook and twatter,  that golden goose called wit, you'll probably enjoy that. Otherwise... IDK what to tell you.

Speaking of reddit. Just because reddit says it's so does not make it so.. I mean... ffs... the spirituality subreddit is taken over by ""white light, nobody has an original self and all news is lies, there's not dire situations affecting the world and we're all the shchizophrenic universe trying to understand itself, so we don't have a reason to have authentic personalities or critical thinking because woo woo bs."" Did reddit have a golden age? IDK, sifting through that mess is just about as bad as it was sifting through the septic tank that is facebook for a while, it's just getting waste... err waist... high and not ankle high, and people pounce on others with weak gacha's they've got to almost beg for someone to set up, with replies that're absolutely devoid of any intelligence whatsoever. Am I missing a good side of reddit? IDK, maybe I am, however, the point is... Dev would announce a promo like ""Hey, get both games for free."" here on Steam and on their discord. No such promo was ever promised, and anyone who gets a copy of this game for free did so because one promo was to give it free to people who bought the OG; Giving the OG game for free for a span of time was also a cool deal they have going on for a few days, damned generous to give both games away free to separate audiences. Neither of these promo's overlaps, and don't believe the BS that they do.

They're an indie team ffs, if you want to gripe about someone not giving you something for free, Ubisoft/EA/Blizzard have your number, and will happily give you many free games that come with an inbuilt casino that gets you addicted to pay for the free game.

Devs gotta eat, and, imo, these devs are being EXTREMELY generous by offering those two separate promo's at the same time on top of a launch discount. 

Yes, I did receive this game for free, no, I did not receive the OG one for free, which is why I got this one for free, I've owned the OG one for years on Steam. Also, no, just because I get a game for free that's paid, that does not inhibit me from being brutally honest and tearing into a game done bad, this game is genuinely a good game, and I thoroughly encourage you to at the very least try the demo if it's still available, or, if this is before the cut off date later on in the month, snag the OG one and try it out to see if you like it, if you do, then, this is worth the money spent.

Finally, this is the only game I've had an external sign on for that didn't wipe my saves between devices. This includes my OG save from my first kingdom. I was able to play it in browser, on the old laptop, then another laptop, also my phone when Elite Dangerous destroyed that other laptop, and this one, in the original version and the new rewind version.

667,136933426,1457080,"So the game is good, it's not worth $30 at all, it should be $15 or something. The game seems approximately 10-ish hours. I got this number based on the frequency of achievements every time I finished a mission (around 10 to 15 mission achievements). And the DLC is not worth it. Seriously, the Spells Pack is Riot Forge trying to get more money from the consumers, things like that should NEVER be locked behind your wallet.  

The gameplay so far (and based on other comments and videos i have seen) is a fair-paced rouge*LITE*. The combat area is similar to Wizard Of Legend (a better-priced game that uses magic quite well). If you are looking for the fast-paced movement of Hades, you will not find it here. BUT if you have played games like Wizard Of Legend, Binding Of Issac, and Dead Cells (Excluding the bizarre movement speed you can reach in Dead Cells) then you might like the pacing of this game. 

The combat can be clunky and monotonous if you ONLY button mash and you don't try to be creative in your attacks. Using the chains to follow up and (insert your attacks here) is one example of doing this. 
Despite only having an hour in as of writing this, I am fully aware that the gameplay will still be the same, as for the graphics and quality it is purely subjective.

The lack of voice acting should not be a reason to dislike the game. While it is true Riot Forge could have done more, it should not be the sole reason to dislike it. 

TLDR:

A great game made by Digital Sun (seriously Moonlighter is good and try out 11 Bit Studios games as well) and a very pleasant time. However, it shouldn't be priced so high for such a short game (keep in mind I hypothesize it to be 10 ish hours). Best to wait for a sale, but that is the choice of the publisher. Since it is Riot that published it, don't expect one anytime soon. 

But if you really want to play the game, i'd say go for it. Once you unlock the forge stop the game and think if you REALLY want to spend money on this game or refund it. Personally, I want to keep playing so I'll take the hit.",1.0

Minecraft Legends boasts good graphics and a cel-shaded style reminiscent of Borderlands and Minecraft trailers.

The game mechanics are fun and engaging, and the feature set is interesting, with players able to construct and control minions like golems, send allies to collect resources, and build structures in an Age of Empires style.

Cons:
The quests can be repetitive, such as defending villages and slaying mobs, leading to boredom.
The storyline is slow and uninspiring, which might not keep players engaged.
The price point of the game is a little high, considering its current features. However, it could be improved with future updates.

Sausage Bomber is apparently a popular mobile game that came out a while back and Dogfight is that developer's attempt to make a shmup spin-off of it. It's short and on the default difficulty, not particularly hard, but it does play well and has some neat features to encourage replayability.

You have 4 characters to choose from, though they are purely cosmetic in difference. Up to 4 player local-only co-op is supported, but you could also use Steam Remote Play to play online with others off a single copy. Every level has a star rating based on how well you play and the more stars you collect across all your saves, the more of the rather extensive weapon catalog you'll unlock. Some weapons are definitely notably better than others, but it gives you a lot of different playstyles to experiment with and it's nice that it doesn't have to be done off a single save slot.

Strangely, though Dogfight has a fairly robust scoring system, there are no leaderboards of any kind, offline or online. I'm not sure why they'd bother putting together a scoring system and then provide no way to track it.  There is an interesting speedrun system where a timer is attached to each save and you can have the game increase its speed every time you kill an enemy (and decrease when you get hit), up to 1.6x normal speed to encourage shorter playtimes. There are also local stats tracked for your speedruns, which makes the lack of score leaderboards even stranger. Still, it's neat to see a game embrace speedrunning in its core mechanics like this.

Honestly, the price for this is pretty steep given the content on offer, unless you want to play it multiple times through to get all the unlocks or compete for speedrunning times. It's not a bad shmup by any means and I enjoyed my time with it, but was surprised to see the price afterward.",1.0

709,136936777,1457080,"One of Riots weakest aspects as a corporation/ game development company is the stories they write- i.e, they don't. At least, not anymore. For the past 5-6 champions, lore surrounding them has been pretty bare-bones.
When Sylas first came out, he actually had a really interesting story- however, Riot being Riot, did not elaborate on it at all. They also tried to both-sides the story a little bit (Demacia is very fascistic), which always rubbed me the wrong way. Sylas, while not necessarily a good guy, is definitely in the right in his story.

Mageseeker really adds a lot more to Sylas' character. This is the first time I've really seen or felt him being portrayed in a more sympathetic light- Sylas is clearly a broken man. He doesn't want to go into dungeons all that much, he seems to have a hard time making friends. While I'm still fairly early on in the game and I don't think the story is anything to take to the presses, I greatly appreciate that Sylas' character gets a bit more exploration in this.

The gameplay loop is... interesting. Initially, I did not expect the amount of upgrades that would be available, but the more mages you recruit into your camp, the more you can upgrade aspects of your character. There's honestly more depth in the system than I would have expected when I started the game. The combat is fun, if a little mindless. The ability to steal and use the magic of other mages is really cool, but its implementation is a little clunky, even with mouse+keyboard. Having to press shift+ right mouse while also hovering over the specific target can be tedious, especially in combat when there are so many enemies around.

The art is, I think, a bit of an acquired taste. In the over world, characters are sparsely detailed, but their silhouettes are very identifiable, so it's not like it's messy or confusing. Character art during dialogue looks a little awkward to me, but that could be because I'm used to Riots portraits. The actual environments are nice, but it does sometimes feel a little constrained in that corridors feel very narrow, and even battle arenas feel small at times (though they do vary them up quite a bit, which I appreciate). I imagine that, as I continue playing, I'll get to see a little more of how Digital Sun decided to depict Runterra- Demacia is, canonically, very large, and has a lot of interesting biomes you can play with (still hoping to see some petricite forests). 
I am a little confused as to why there's no voice acting in the game, as I would think it wouldn't be that difficult to get Sylas' voice actor given Riots notoriety, but that may have been a decision on Digital Suns part. The music feels very in-line with Leagues music in that its not very boisterous, but its still a good listen, and you do notice it if you pay attention.

Overall, I've enjoyed my time with the game thus far. Maybe my opinion will change as I play through, but I think Digital Sun is really good at beat-em-ups, so I can't imagine I'll dislike it all that much.",1.0

I am not one for pixel art, but it worked for this game and every hero you could use was distinct in both art style and gameplay.  Did not play with the blood dlc, but am planning to my second go.

 Progression feels impactful, whether that be new weapon mods, team perks, or new heroes. The price is fair for the content - I think I would spend up to $20 on this game in it's current state.  I am hopeful for additional story, characters, etc dlc - and I think they should charge for it since the game is only like $12 and I would like them to continue with this genre, which requires funds.

""Well, we just had the displeasure of experiencing what can only be described as a soulless and predatory excuse for a cart racer. This game lacks any of the charm, polish, or heart that we have come to expect from a Disney-branded product.

From the moment we launched the game, we were bombarded with predatory monetization tactics that left a bad taste in our mouths. It's clear that the developers were more interested in squeezing every penny out of their customers than creating a fun and engaging game.

But even if we look past the monetization, The game play is uninspired. A truly Middling experience.

It's truly disappointing to see such a beloved brand being tarnished by a game that clearly prioritizes profits over quality. We can't in good conscience recommend this game to anyone, and we hope that Disney takes a hard look at the developers they are partnering with in the future.

📜 [b]Intro[/b]
Deathchron is an action and platform game with an 8-bit style quite similar to the nes games with a limited color palette and music, like the games of that time Deathchron does not have a deep story so is simple and barely understandable is explain with a few images: you find a robot, you drive it, you kill enemies and you save the world.
There are 5 different levels and the selection of these is through a screen where the physical locations of these levels are shown and you select the desired level very similar to megaman but with the big difference that the levels are locked and you have to follow a linear order yes or yes, which makes this type of level selection screen meaningless, the game pays a lot of tribute to 8-bit games with a beautiful and well-detailed pixel style as well as the sound track but this last ends up being poorer because all the levels share the same song even in the fighting with bosses which takes away epicism since it is very tiring to listen to the same music all game.

🎮 [b]playable mechanics[/b]
The game is in 2D with classic gameplay of moving forward, jumping and shooting enemies, several enemies are capable of shooting so you constantly have to dodge enemy shots by jumping, the robot has a 3-state health bar which you can increase with upgrades from the menu by spending pieces that enemies drop and special orbs that reward you when you solve a special puzzle or kill a boss (currently the system is bugged so you can infinitely collect an orb if you collect it and then die), these upgrades in addition of life there are also special weapons, they have their own ammunition, the bad thing is that to reload a single bullet these special weapons you have to use a container [E] which are limited and also serves to restore your life so if you want to reload special weapons you can't heal yourself.
An added mechanic is the possibility for the child to get off the robot to go through small places or climb stairs to solve puzzles on occasions necessary to advance and on others for special items, the child's mobility is limited as well as his life ( which is reduced to 1), it is not highly recommended to get out of the robot often since the child can only jump one block so if you move away from the robot it is likely that you will not be able to return to it and you will end up stuck.
The level design is generally good, it feels entertaining and challenging, in addition to keeping elements typical of the games of that time, such as the typical water that is instakill, as well as the enemies that shoot at you while you jump, jumping into the water and having to start from the last save point.
Each level has a themed boss with the environment of the level, the visual design is magnificent but the playable one not so much since some of the bosses' attacks seem unavoidable especially the first boss.

💭 [b]Conclusion[/b]
The game is short and visually it is fantastic, it really looks like an 8-bit game from past times but with current gameplay as well as fluid control, but unfortunately it cannot be recommended for purchase in its current state, the game has many bugs such as getting stuck in certain places, that of the infinite improvement objects and worst of all, the possible corruption of the saved game in which it can take you to another more advanced level and with the corrupted level making it impossible to continue and having to start the game from the biginning. If these severe bugs are solved you can give it a try since the game is cheap and is entertaining.

I'm going to preface this review by saying that I actually like the game. 
I love the show Stargate, and this is the Stargatge game I've always wanted. 
I also plan to continue playing the game, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone right now. I've run into quite a few bugs and I've only been playing for 2 hrs.
I have to create a new save every time I save the game, which isn't game breaking. Its just annoying.
My worker-bots keep being idle even when there is work to do and i have plenty of money (maybe there is a reason why they're not working that I'm not aware of?).
But the worst bug I've come across is my camera not panning. About every 10 minutes or so my camera will freeze and I'm unable to move around (I can still zoom in and out though). The only way to fix it is to log out of the game. 

The game is also lacking visually. All the rooms are very bland looking and there really Isn't any customization or decorating options. I know its suppose to look like a government facility, but it doesn't need to look THAT boring. 

Overall, it looks promising. But it is going to need a lot more content and some major bug fixes to be worth the price tag.",0.0

781,136940137,1851030,"While I haven't played fighting games past a casual level, I am a huge rhythm game nerd and am having a blast playing this game.

I see a lot of reviews complaining about the lack of a vertical scrolling option, and I honestly do not think it should be added SOLELY on the basis of convenience. Hear me out.

I can play some of the hardest charts of Museca, Jubeat, Chunithm, Guitar Hero, Groove Coaster, Taiko, Crossbeats, Muse Dash, Osu!, and Osu!mania. I greatly enjoy but suck at Pop'n, SDVX, and PIU doubles. 

Why did I bother listing those? If you look them up, almost all of them have a different take on how a player hits notes. Some of them are super intuitive and can be learned quickly (for me, Jubeat), but some of them can take extra practice to learn even if you have an extensive rhythm gaming background (Taiko and SDVX). Different people pick up different games faster, even some of the ""hard"" games can be easy for some folks to learn.

In the same way, some fighting games are pretty intuitive in their controls (smash), while other games require a lot of learning and practice before you even remotely begin to feel like you're experiencing the intended gameplay (skullgirls).

I think it is entirely okay for God of Rock to come out with a new take on rhythm games in the form of a difficult 4-key horizontal lane. It just means you probably can't hit the ground running and be a pro. You actually have to take time to learn the controls, figure out what keybinds work for you, and above all else practice if you want to be decent. Just like a lot of the harder rhythm AND fighting games.

I generally think the game is challenging. If you're not used to reading streams and patterns, ESPECIALLY in a horizontal format like Taiko, this game will be really, really hard.

If it's purely an ACCESSIBILITY issue, as in no matter how much a person practices they can't physically read the notes coming in sideways, then yes by all means please add a vertical option if possible. Make the game accessible. But if it's just for the sake of convenience? I'm okay with this game taking me extra time to feel comfortable. The game doesn't need to be convenient and easy to learn, but it will limit the number of people willing to play (just look at other reviews lol). 

So I guess it's up to the devs to decide which matters more, a small audience of players willing to improve to be able to play, or a wider audience. I was looking for a challenging rhythm game, and that's exactly what I got, so I overall recommend it if you're looking for that.",1.0
782,136941390,1537830,"[h1] Not recommending at the present time for a number of reasons, each explained below later. TLDR at the end.[/h1]

First, let's talk about the positives.

Gameplay is great. Short learning curve for basic mechanics (driving, items, etc.), and races are very exciting. I'm having fun in every single one. I've been playing single-player for my first couple of hours, but the bots are competitive, so you won't be disappointed if you want higher difficulty. 

There's plenty of modes, whether you want to play single-player or online. You start with a ""starter circuit"" that you need to progress on in order to unlock the other modes. If you want to race as Mickey, Donald or Goofy, you're in luck because you unlock those characters within the first hour or so.

Graphics and the overall look/feel of the game is good. Soundtrack lowkey slaps (remixes of classic Disney songs in electronic/club style) However the cars look extremely generic. Would have loved it if each of the characters drove in their own themed cars like Mario Kart but the liveries for the cars fit the characters well. 

Another thing I want to say is how blown away I was when they announced Figment as a character. As a fan of the Disney Parks and the lore/history surrounding the character, I can appreciate him coming into the limelight more. And if Figment was the first Parks related character that the devs announced (he IS in the Walt Disney World collection), I can bet that they're going to add more as the seasons come and go. (Hell, we even got our first Dreamfinder reference in YEARS, even if he's only a crew member. And I can appreciate seeing Orange Bird and Sonny Eclipse as well. Huge surprises.) The Figment announcement is what compelled me to buy the game in the first place.

Which brings me to the negatives; of which there are a few:

The amount of grinding one will have to do in order to obtain the characters/cosmetics/upgrades and whatnot will be long as hell. This is because this game is designed like a typical mobile/gatcha game. The amount of microtransactions here are overwhelming. No game should have FOUR in-game currencies. It will take me a LONG time to unlock Figment because he is the rarest character in the game, and the whole character shards thing being pegged to the rarity level makes it even worse. You also can't unlock the loot box that these shards are in unless you have 10,000 ""season coins"" that can mostly only be unlocked if you have the season/battle pass. (I will say that the standard founders pack gives you two credits towards your first two passes, but after that, it's money out of your pocket.) 

There's also no excuse for early access and the standard founders pack to be worth $30. Most people can wait until the game goes free-to-play later this year. It just isn't worth it for most people just to be able to unlock special skins and be a couple steps ahead of everyone else. I have heard that people aren't receiving refunds on their editions since it is technically DLC and cannot be returned. Really scummy thing to do. 

I also think the whole upgrading/crew experience is more complicated than it needs to be. I think many people will find it overwhelming. This also kinda plays into the microtransactions; if you want your car to go faster, drift better, etc. then you either grind for a long time or pay your way up.

Overall, for the average person, I would definitely wait until this goes free-to-play if you want to check this out. Early access isn't worth it, at least for me. But everyone is different. If you really like Disney characters and love kart racing, and simply can't wait a few months, then go ahead and get it. It really is a fun kart racer, but the obvious cash-grab elements and convoluted progression system stick out like a sore thumb. I hope Gamestop and Disney can get their act together on these fronts. 

[b]TLDR: The game is fun, graphics are good, and Figment is in it,  but the convoluted progression and microtransactions are overwhelming. Do NOT shoot for early access if you have any doubts about it, it's not worth it for most people. Wait for the game to go free-to-play. If any of the negatives significantly improve, I'll update the review accordingly, but in it's present state, the game needs some work.[/b]

784,136941130,1537830,"I don't think this is worth buying atm. You should wait until it exits early access. The racing feels great with a very big caveat being that you are forced to level up each racer, level up their star level and these require a variety of currencies to achieve. The multiplayer mode where everyone picks a character and you're on a level playing field is great. The game is fast and the items have multiple uses. Each character has a unique power up as well. I think the tracks are a joy to race on too. Lots of different paths or rails to grind which offer some strategy. It's just held back by the f2p monetization. It's just so egregious. 3 different currencies, currencies to level up each racer by franchise and type. Then you need to collect multiple of each racer to level up their star power... It just never ends. It's a shame because it is a fun game and I am enjoying it, but I wish I had known how deep the microtransactions went. Also it's a bit messed up that you get a free character unlock with early access but the game doesn't show you the character rarity until after you pick one.

Gameplay is super fun love the racers extra moves but i would like to see them put in more regular power ups... the same 5 are getting boring",1.0

You control a land drone from the 90's in a cave searching for body's/evidence on what is actually going on.

This game has great atmosphere and sound design!

Definitely worth the money!

Highly Recommend!!!!",1.0
789,136939662,2282480,"Man, this is what indie games are all about.  Embracing the limitations and turning them into something artistically amazing.  

This is basically a walking simulator but in the form of investigative tapes and you control the state of the art drone (for the 90s).  The story is solid; while an overused subject, I liked this interpretation.  The graphics and display all work in favor of a found footage collection.  

This is a pure work of art.  This is why I play indie games.  This is also why I particularly like indie horror.  Expect a good 35-45 minutes.

792,136941375,1976950,"Bought the previous version when I randomly came across the promotion.  It's definitely more puzzle game than dungeon crawler.  I'm engaged in it a lot more than I expected to be.  Don't be like me and just skip all of the tutorials at first, they're well done and informative without wasting too much of your time explaining obvious nonsense.

One thing that isn't great is the quality of the display.  It's pretty clear that they didn't do a high resolution version of the UI as at 4K it looks soft and blurry as if it's just been crudely upscaled, so the presentation isn't great.  Could have easily jazzed up the graphics in general by a LOT while still running fine on potato PCs.",1.0
793,136941141,1976950,"I hecking LOVE Desktop Dungeons.

I think I've actually been playing this game since its inception, I was probably in middleschool when I found this game. I remember when this game looked absolutely horrible and I still played it many weekends as a kid. It's been pretty neat watching the game evolve over the years. I wonder if I found it on gamemaker studios or just from googling roguelike rpgs.

But this is a pretty good roguelike puzzle rpg. It starts off fairly simple, but very quickly the game starts to get very difficult and you have to start to learn how to push every mechanic at your disposal to its absolute limit. Sometimes you might find a very powerful combo or exact counter to a level instead. You'll even start this game thinking a few race class combos are best but then you'll come across a mechanic that requires completely different types of builds. It stays fresh pretty well and there's a lot of challenge to try to overcome.
You can play a single game very quickly, if you have a lunch break you can play a round of this and move on easily.",1.0

Good game - if you have time give it a chance!
See my profile for more details about my reviews.

Additional notes: if you want to know if you will like this game, play the free version first! It was an interesting/okay game. Now the care has been doubled and it is in 3D, the game is still casual in looks and nerdy/hardcore in content, but much more user friendly I reckon. If you LOVE the free version then buy this one to support the devs. Very interesting concept of rogue/base building/rpg/puzzles... old school, classic, nice little game in looks, but rich in content.",1.0
796,136939711,1976950,"I was totally ready to buy this game all over again, and they went and gave it for free to anyone who owned the original! 

I've played the original game since before it launched on steam 10 years ago - back when it was still in closed beta - and it's right up there among my best games of all time. This version adds a few smart tweaks and a fresh new look to a game which remains at its core incredibly clever, challenging, and rewarding, and I cannot recommend it enough.",1.0

803,136941149,1928870,"I normally don't review games negatively but this one was a disappointment. I have been pretty excited to buy this and was really trying to give it some hope but at the end of the first day I am just sitting here pretty happy to be done playing it. Personally it is not frustrating but I was just super bored and I have played some pretty long RTS matches. Nothing happens for most of the match, it feels like its a stale mate up until its gone so long that people loose focus about defense. It takes already a long time to get into a match and I dont feel like I sit here wondering what I could of done better or what I want to change about my strategy for the next match. I absolutely dont think the multiplayer mode has longevity, I feel like the audience this game is probably going to attract does not have a deep sense for strategy for this type of game, nothing against them but it is already apparent to me that most of my teammates do not even understand what is going on. I know it is day one but its so bad that I cant hope for it to get much better. I have been the only one building defenses and when it comes to attacking everything feels week except the redstone launcher. I think this game is going to die out pretty quick so if you bought it I would try to get a refund if it is not too late. Wait for a sale to get the story mode, I personally can wait for that if I am still interested in giving a second chance. I hope I am wrong and this game makes some big changes but I am pretty doubtful as of right not. I am currently confused how Mojang let something like this on the market, they had to of seen some of these major flaws before launching. Luckily I stopped just in time for a refund.",0.0

809,136940701,1928870,"I love minecraft, but this game has been a huge letdown on release in terms of the versus mode (pvp). The singleplayer is meh, I don't really play single player games (I only played some of it), so I won't touch on that. 

- The inability to conduct Teamwork
In many of the promotional content for this game, they really talk about the teamwork as being a main aspect of the game, yet there is no text chat nor voice chat. In addition, it is extremely difficult to play with friends in versus mode. You cannot queue with friends unless its a private match. You have to host or join a public game where you cannot even change teams to play on your friend's team. It seems the dev team said, ""this game is fun on lan, lets release it"". 

- No reason to play pvp except momentary fun
In comparison to other pvp competitive multiplayer games, this game fails to even come close to caring about the pvp mode. No leaderboards, no rewards, no nothing for winning. If you want to make a competition gamemode, at least capitalize on it by adding more fun things to it.

I like this game but, at this price, there needs to be more effort. I'm sure there are more cons to talk about but these two are the most important to me.",0.0

Well, it runs fairly smoothly. There's absolutely nothing to it though and if these guys are coding students, I don't know who is teaching them but they seem to have missed the bit where they create a worthwhile Hack and Slash game. These kids could be leaving university with a steady income if they'd just put a bit more game in their game. I would like to see a sequel with a bit more ultrawide aspect ratios support, some information about the abilities, lift all the good features from Hack and Slash (and Hades is NOT a stand out of the genre btw - it's simply one of the least bad ones that's still going), zoom out about 500% because this is to Hades as Duplo is to Lego at the moment. The game has 3 enemy types which is incredibly boring and there's no information about the levels that are coming etc etc etc.

I've no idea what they were learning from this - the only thing I can guess is that perhaps it's about the code in the background? It wasn't lagging even running at speed so maybe they created a hyper efficient code base in comparison to Hades which can really lag when it's got a lot of stuff on screen. Who knows?

Curse of the Corsair II please. Lets see what you can do when you try and make money, which should obviously be what students should be doing with these projects.",1.0
