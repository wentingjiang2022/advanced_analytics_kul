16,136555240.0,2156300,In its current state I wouldn't recommend this game. It has potential but if every episode is going to be 30 minutes of game play its not worth it. There were bugs and accessing the pause menu is impossible to work if there's any sort of interaction on the screen. It's impossible to turn the music off and there's no way to roll-back or remove the ui to look at the renders. Also not being able to skip at certain points can get rather annoying and opening the logs just throws up errors. The beta felt longer than all the new content and even then a lot of the new content was already show in the trailers and renders that have been released.,0.0

This game is a perfect combination of card collection, deck building, and tactical combat. It is very easy to pick up and play but has enough depth to encourage replays to improve your strategy.

The hand-drawn artwork in this game is awesome, from the unique and varied card designs to the incredibly detailed backgrounds and interfaces. The music is fantastic and perfectly suits the action in the game. Each card has its own strengths and weaknesses that can be augmented with skills and loot, so each round requires careful consideration and strategic thinking.

Overall I really enjoy Fourteen Fiends for its fun, quick gameplay and the potential for deeper strategy from different combinations of cards. Highly recommended!",1.0
21,136573277.0,1409300,"What a great start by Pendopo Creations to take a debut step in a early Q2 2023. This game kinda remind me of Lacuna and Virtua Verse since those games look pretty similar. But, review is review so I'm gonna tell what I felt and experienced while playing this game. 

Start by the premise of story, Setyo starting to take a step in Bay City as a foreign agent and then as a security of a tech company. While his colleague, Jack, who works in Bureau appearing in Bay City and gave Setyo a bad news about the lost of his sister so it forced Setyo coming back to Neo-Surabaya and find some clues about his sister. All I can say, the plot is properly wrapped in a 6 chapters in total which makes the story more focused. The story doesn't feel rushed at all. Plot is surprisingly attractive so the experience kinda similar as watching a movie. Besides that, the dialog is well written in english. So, from the story aspect, I could say this game is a have a great plot, not rushed, and a well-written dialog. 

For Indonesian folks, trust me, some of the dialog is so much related to our culture and society nowadays. One of my favorite is while there's a conversation talking about ""a department"" of a country that loved to block an access of one of a biggest game marketplace in a world.
Story: 8/10

Move into the gameplay, this game, put it simply, is an action adventure game with a side-scrolling thingy like Lacuna and VirtuaVerse. The most important value that been delivered by dev to this game is at puzzle and combat mechanics. Puzzle mechs are variative which make this game has a bit of repetitive level. I'm sure that you're not gonna get bored while facing all puzzles in every chapter on this game. Okay, let's say some of them are stealth, hacking like a Watchdogs game, bunker code solving, making a key, ""stay calm while disguise"" with a rythm alike system, etc. There's so much variation of puzzle so I can't put it here all one by one. Besides puzzle thingy, this game also have a freedom for us to fight some foes with any weapon and a combat system. A combat system is quite okay, i think. One thing that annoyed me is just an energy and consumable items while in a fight. Energy drought so fast and consumable items a bit complicated since you need to open an inventory first and the consume the item. It will be better IF this game giving us a ""quick action button"" so we don't need to try hard anymore. 
Gameplay: 7,5/10

The graphics is lovely jubbly. Imagine, the composition of 2.5D pixelated game combined with a proper lighting and synthwave colour tone is just right. It looks satisfying. This game is actually worth for some players who loves to see a pixelated or cyberpunk game themed. Give it a try!
Graphics: 8.5/10

Finally, talking about sound/audio. All I can say is the background music is well delivered in any situation so the tense properly build up while playing the game. When we need to be relax, stressed, pressured, it's all depicted good by a presence of a cyberpunk themed music. 
Sound: 7/10

So, in the end, the pros and cons of this game are
Pros:
+Better plot, movie alike and doesn't feel cheap. 
+Puzzle mechs variative which makes the experience doesn't feel bored.
+Dialog is well written, some of them talking about Indonesian culture and society issues
+Oooomagaaa, the graphics bro, beautiful. 
+There is so many Indonesian thingy in a game like tukang sate, kang cilok, preman, pertunjukan seni, etc while the game is delivered to be fantasy futuristic. 

Cons: 
- Game still buggy and stuck at loading because of steam overlay. pro tip: don't ever open a steam overlay while playing the game. Let's hope the dev will fix it, asap.
- Combat system duh idk, all i want is a ""quick action button"" and some clarity improvement while in a stealth mission. 
- Bahasa Indonesianya ga ada cookkk, semoga ntar ditambahin hehe, ksabar.
- There is no manual saving

Overall, this game is at 7,75/10. Is this recommended? Yes, it is recommended. With this rate of price, you can get an experience of exploring to a deep down of an Indonesian greatest civilization with hi-tech thingy with a great story and puzzle mechs. Let's go give em a try!

25,136574485.0,1949030,"I'm only 4 hours in but I wanted to say that I love this game. It's different from the other Frogwares Sherlock Holmes games in that you are solving one grand overarching mystery rather than individual cases, so I haven't had the experience of having to pick who I thought did it with what in that intense and wonderful way that the other games have, but the story that it is telling is so damn compelling that I don't care. I'm still finding clues and slowly piecing together what's happening, all while people are dying and crazy supernatural stuff is happening around me.

The juxtaposition of Lovecraft and Holmes works perfectly, the aesthetics combine well, and I love Holmes' analytical mind trying to work out why there's weird supernatural bullshit happening. I'm super excited to find out what is going on. 

On the mechanical side, this game uses the same engine as Chapter One but adds some excellent quality of life improvements. For one, I think the open world was a detriment to Chapter One, and this one is much more linear which is good. For another you can click Z to have all of the interactable items pop up around you, which is an amazing thing to have in this sort of mystery adventure game.

Special shoutout to the characterization, writing, and acting of Watson in this, he is so good.

It is fun and quite relaxing but sadly there is not enough gameplay for me to come back to the game if this is the ""Final"" version.

28,119682629.0,1729900,"Now let me get this out of the way. The game has potential. But right now it's very clearly unfinished. My first problem is there being no tutorial, thankfully somebody posted a guide explaining the basic mechanics. Apparently there's a flow mode and different characters have different things they specialize in (For example: More damage but you take more damage, stronger flow mode, etc.) But I didn't even realize this for the first 10 minutes since none of this is explained to you. Even the guide doesn't specify what character does what. Also, speaking of characters. Their designs for most of them are unfinished. One character looks like they got somebody else to draw smoothly. The rest though are hand drawn models that look like a deveant art OC. Hell, in actual matches there's not even the character model. Just a rough sketch with basic outlines. Now (In my opinion) the worst thing about this game is there's no online multiplayer. Sure you CAN play with friends. But that seems local only. It could be a 6/10 with the online multiplayers, but without it (including the rest of my points) it drops down to about a 4-5/10. Fix all these issues and you got a solid 7-8/10 rythm Game.
TLDR; Add a tutorial and online multiplayer, along with finishing the characters and you get a solid game.",0.0
29,118681190.0,1729900,"Rhythm Brawl is a laughably poor Guitar Hero ripoff with an adversarial bent as you play a 3 button rhythm game to some pretty craptastic music and wonder why Valve doesn't have the quality control for Steam it so badly needs.  There's a few different game modes and you can play PvP or vs the computer or just watch the computer play itself, this is convenient because while the computer is playing itself you can go find a pencil to rupture your eardrums so you don't have to listen to the crap music anymore.  Very thoughtful of the developers there. 

The nicest thing I can say about this is that it doesn't use 2D retro pixel ""art"".  Unfortunately, instead, it uses some of the most eye gougingly bad high school art class dropout drawings (I won't deign to call that scribbling ""art"") instead.  Like really bad.  Pixel art would be better, seriously, it's atrocious.  The developers indicated they would replace it, but that hasn't happened yet, so the game gets judged for what it is. 

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the Godot game engine/toolset.  This is a very poor quality toolset sometimes used by amateur developers as it's free (so they don't have to pay for GameMaker Studio) and doesn't require advanced game development skills, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities (it's arguably worse than GameMaker Studio).  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.

They're seriously trying to charge money for this, $4 USD plus an eye watering $8 USD to unlock the rest of the game they haven't finished (yeah, there's DLC for an incomplete Early Access game, that's not okay to the point of being unethical).  All that for a business model to try compete with Spotify by charging $12 USD for 6 crap songs on Steam.  Ugh.  If you play this game I recommend proactively seeing an oncologist afterwards.",0.0
30,121230865.0,1729900,"Rhythm Brawl, unlike most games I don't recommend, has A LOT of promise. I VERY MUCH so hope this game gets an update that fixes all issues, because I believe that this game could be something magical if fixed in the future. also I HIGHLY encourage the developer/developers to reply to this message once an update is put out! I would love to change this review to a recommend.

First off, A LOT of the art is unfinished. I'm of the belief that if you plan on making a commercial product, you HAVE to finish those kinds of assets beforehand. I understand this game is in Early Access, but this feels like an EARLY EARLY ACCESS. A would love to also see different character have different passive abilities and maybe an attack move that's different per character. More music would be awesome as well. 

Along with this, online play would be huge for a game like this. My final thoughts are that if you add Steam Workshop this could be the defacto Rhythm Fighting game that people have been begging for. You have something special here. Please add Steam Workshop. Other than that, if the game fixes these issues, this will be an incredible game.",0.0

You can view my initial impressions review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/9Wax1TLL-gc

Anybody who follows my reviews knows that I absolutely love VR roller coaster / amusement park rides. So this game should be right up my alley, a fun twist on the coaster formula with some action adventure thrown in. 

Yeah, this game took everything I enjoy about coasters and made it into a bland, repetitive game that sucks all the joy & thrills from fun rides. It's a poorly made game on the Unreal Engine. At least it seemed be to be running at a steady 90 fps on my RTX 3080 and it did not crash. That ends anything positive I can say about this experience.

The visuals are ugly. The UI is horrible. Your motion controllers (at least on the Quest Touch controllers) are mis-aligned with your avatar pickaxes / shield that you hold. The feedback from any action is terrible. I couldn't tell whether I had hit an object or if I had correctly blocked or dodged out of the way. The sounds are bad as well. The music is bad. The gameplay is bland and repetitive. 

I would not recommend this game if it were free to play. I wanted to quit after 30 minutes of gameplay. I went with my gut feelings to quit and do anything else. Maybe someone out there can play this game for longer than 30 minutes, but for my own sanity I will uninstall this game and never play it again.

It's nuts and easily one of the better ""Vampire Survivor-likes"" out there. If you're looking for a wild time where you spent a few minutes between rounds figuring out a ton of gimmicks to chain together to create utter nonsense before you fight again, this is for you. It's more or less an ""engine building"" game, where one thing triggers another thing and efficiency buffs damage and things... Start off with a simple Spine and a tentacle gun, make it so that tentacle gun bursts into a giant skeleton blade on contact and poisons things. Use another brain to maybe build a function that connects all enemies who are poisons to be chains together by a death beam that saps their health for five seconds. Now do that for a default (for most prototype characters) for 8 total modules and level up to maybe 12, and up to four brains doing different things. Want to go summoner? Take a Queen and pick up every spawn thing you can, make them shoot instead of you or carry around debuff clouds. Want to machine gun things? Take a bunch of piercing tentacles and boxer nerves to trigger a lot of ""on hit do this"" commands. Don't worry about committing to stuff... you can tear these structures all down and reuse your components or sell them off between fights. Also has a trial mode so you can test your crazy thing before you actually have to worry about dying. 

Freaking fantastic. Thoughtful, strange, and something to really make you think a bit to optimize. Only real complaint at the moment is enemies mostly just run at you at various speeds and take more or less damage. Feels like they're just messing around to get all the node building right at the moment and maybe enemies become more interesting in the future. Still, worth it just to screw with.

[i]Simple Sky[/i] is top-down twin-stick space-shooter/score-chaser with some unique ideas. The simple and bright artwork gives the game a friendly appearance, but after I headed into the main game, I quickly realized that it gives the player no quarter. There are 10 difficulty settings, and only two are unlocked in the very beginning. Well, so far, I have yet to unlock another. Please keep in mind that this game is in Early Access currently, and some of my discussion may be outdated by the time you are looking at the game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The idea is simple, you start off as a ship with a main and secondary weapon, all of your movements use your energy reserves that spontaneously regenerate, and every action has a cooldown. Enemies start coming after you in what almost seems like a survival arena and you need to fend them off until the boss encounter for that particular stage, after which you can complete the stage and move on or stay behind to gather some more resources, though with a finite absolute time limit. There's a visual countdown to when things start going haywire if you stay too long, so it's not difficult to gauge this.

During your time spent on any level, finding local planets of various sizes and mining their resources will be very important. These resources are currency that you also get by killing enemies and you can upgrade your ship every time you reach a preset ""value."" You need to be docked on a planet while you upgrade, and this isn't difficult, you can run headfirst into a planet and that counts as docking.

When you make an upgrade, you are given a choice from 3 random selections. You can gradually maximize your firepower, your abilities, your cooldowns, HP, etc. through your various upgrades. You can even increase how many selections you get when you upgrade. If you get lucky early on, you can take an upgrade to make it possible to upgrade mid-flight, which doesn't seem like much, but is actually a huge boon. Or at least I think so.

In each level, you are constantly being hunted by the boss, which slowly approaches you from afar. You can see where it is and where you are, along with locations of the different planets on the minimap. It would seem that either avoiding the boss in the beginning or heading right in may each have its own benefits, I have yet to figure out the perfect strategy.

The individual runs in this game are usually pretty short. If I don't have a good combination going for me from the first few upgrades, I find that I can rarely make it to or past the 2nd boss. With some nice upgrades working in nice synergy, I was able to get to what I thought to be the final boss on the easiest difficulty, though I still struggled to live to the end. I would say average runs for me when things are going well are around 15 minutes or so.

There is a lot of movement based on your momentum, and because you are a ship moving around in space, you can expect to have some arcing movements and annoying ""sliding-on-ice"" feel as you try to maneuver around. This is just something to get used to, it's a game decision that will make a lot of people throw their hands in frustration but it's a decision specifically for this game. Once you get used to it, it won't feel so bad.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
Keyboard and Mouse required, and for some reason I had to launch this on my laptop, since on my main PC, the keyboard was being recognized in the menu, but once the run started, it wouldn't respond. I do hope that this gets hashed out and not too many people buy and need to refund due to unrecognized keyboard controls.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The artwork in this game is nothing to write home about, everything is pretty simplistic in design. It has bright colors and simple designs that give it a bit more friendly appearance, but the game mechanics beg to differ.

[h1]Music & Sounds[/h1]
The music gets super repetitive, to the point that I had to turn it off

[h1]Audience[/h1]
This is where I struggle a bit. I would say more for people who don't mind repetitive deaths and are okay with working through the initial slow bits in an arena-survival/shooter game. The run becomes more enjoyable when you can survive the initial start-up phase, which can be over quickly if things fall in nicely, but can also draw on for a while.

[h1]Pricing[/h1]
Early Access base price is $9.99 with regional pricing. It does have some replay value in that you are trying to chase the high-scores in kills during your runs while also trying to beat the game as fast as you can--the two leaderboards on Steam. I think the price is fair as far as people who enjoy the game are concerned. Those who cannot stand it have plenty of time to experience it prior to making a decision to refund, if truly they determine it's not worthwhile.

[h1]Personal Wishlist[/h1]
1. Have the issue fixed so I can play on my main computer, but the problem is that I have no idea what the issue is.
2. Having a bit simpler initial stages of each run when it comes to upgrades. I find that it's the part I enjoy the least and it tends to drag on for a while, and for me that's the do-or-die part of the run. If I make it, the rest of the run is enjoyable, if I die, then I have to start over from scratch and keep my fingers crossed.
3. More clear-cut synergy effects when upgrading, maybe showing some numbers/stats or highlighting which other prior upgrades will benefit, etc. It would be nice to know whether I am making a good decision or not when upgrading.
4. The mid-flight upgrade option comes up infrequently and I personally dislike the fact that I have to dock to upgrade prior to getting this. I almost wish the requirement to dock to upgrade would be removed completely.
5. More weapons/upgrade options, etc.

Bottom line in regards to this section is me saying that for these kinds of games to keep me interested, I need to see faster earlier progress to get to the fun parts, to keep me coming back and playing another run. It's not difficult to start another run after the previous, but the desire to immediately start is definitely hindered by the knowledge of the beginning grind. It may be only a few minutes, but it's enough to make me hesitate. With that and some additional QoL changes to facilitate smoother and more streamlined gameplay, I would enjoy it a lot more.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[i]Simple Sky[/i] is overall pretty fun, and so far I am enjoying myself. I realize that this game is in Early Access and so I hope to see some improvements in the aspects that I have requested, just to make it even more fun. I have confidence in that this developer will make the game better from its current build as there seems to be an update every time I look at it, especially with the latest one around a request that I had made.

Current score 7/10 (written Oct. 9, 2021).

Thank you for reading.

67,136574855.0,1811990,"So something interesting- While I love roguelike deckbuilders, I frequently find myself frustrated with them. Slay the Spire, Dicey Dungeons, etc, they're fantastic, but bad luck can be extremely frustrating.

I'm not having this problem with Wildfrost.

Now obviously I've only played an hour so far, and I definitely haven't made much progress, but every time I've died so far, I've always felt like it's my fault in some way, whether I made a stupid decision or didn't prepare well, and even in the times when RNG has screwed me via lacking options for card synergy or in-battle junk, it still feels so much less frustrating than in other roguelike deckbuilders. I think this is partially because of the way the gameplay is structured; there's no obvious endpoint, just a continuing path, and you're not spammed with cards or the like. Every encounter keeps you incredibly invested with how you're strategizing, and even when you lose, the progression with the town can help you still feel as though you're making progress.

If you really want to try this game but aren't entirely sure, I'd say go for it. I'm having a blast so far and the literal only reason I'm taking a break after an hour is because I, unfortunately, have important things to do T_T But I will absolutely be back ASAP to see more of this game.

87,136514584.0,2227150,"Pretty neat platformer, controls are tight. Jumps are easy to make, and a good variety in stages. I'm going to lead with letting you know this game is very short, but it is enjoyable its entire duration.

 I think a good thing to do after beating all the levels and collecting all the 40 (? it was an even number I arrived at and I stopped seeing anymore) green coins is to try to beat all the levels with sub-one minute times. The levels feel like they're specifically engineered for this time frame in mind and it forces you to play creatively. 

I want to see this expanded into a larger game. I think the mechanics are polished and the understanding of how to implement platforming gimmicks is there. The dev is obviously very skilled at what they do. I think I got more than 3 dollars of fun out of this. I think an expansion on the concept should provide a purpose to the in game timer, such as beating a dev time or maybe a standalone collectable like the crash bandicoot games.

This is a ringing endorsement but I am going to post the few observances I have with the game after this, as well as my level times. (played with a controller)

good
+ All platforming is incredibly tight and telegraphed very well. 
+ The little overworld is very fun to navigate however small it is. There is one out of the way place that immediately opens a warp after getting it and you can actually skip a few intended platforming parts using the core mechanics.

neutral
= there is an acceleration you have with gliding, it feels like the opposite of what gliding would normally do. I consider this neutral because after you get used to it it feels very satisfying to move around, but there is a learning curve.
= physics with any moving stage gimmicks can be odd at times. It's consistent and you can actually use little things like leverage from spinning platforms to push yourself upwards a bit for more air but it may not do what you expect at first.
= In my opinion, I think the gold coins should be finite. It would give an easy third goal to the areas, and you can very easily afford everything even without the respawns. being able to grind it feels like I didn't earn it. I don't know how much I can criticize the economy in a 3d platformer though. 

bad (these are really really minor issues)
- recovery from a dive seems inconsistent. Sometimes I can recover and other times I feel like I can't and go barreling off the edge. This feels intentional but I couldn't get a feel for what triggered specific reactions.
- The camera snap during the sections where you're repeatedly hitting boosts is a little jarring. This only happens once or twice.
- I would like a little page in the menu that tells you all the information from the levels you completed. this is small but would be important for a larger game. It would have made tracking my level times at the end slightly easier too.

[b]+ A captivating twin-stick shooter metroidvania game with a physics-based grapple and engaging story!ヽ(´• ω •`)、[/b]

[h1][b][1] Intro [/b][/h1]
Rusted Moss is a twin-stick shooter metroidvania game that features a physics-based grapple and full 360° aiming system. Set in a wasteland once inhabited by humans, this game provides a challenging and immersive experience that allows users to feel in complete control of their character.

[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]

The game's twin-stick shooter aspect emphasizes tight and precise gunplay, with players quickly switching between their arsenal of weapons to best suit their playstyle and situation. Players can get up close and personal with a shotgun before grappling away and pulling out a sniper for the killing blow.

The grappling hook is the standout feature of the game, which takes some time to learn but is ultimately rewarding to master. The physics-based elastic grappling hook allows players to latch onto any moss-covered structure and swing their way through the rugged terrain. The freedom created by the controls creates a smooth experience, allowing for creative solutions to flexible traversal challenges.

The game offers a challenging experience, with powerful witches and machine monstrosities as the bosses. Each boss fight throws its own unique challenge at the player, requiring them to push their gunplay and grappling hook skills to their limits. Players must dodge swords, avoid energy fields, and blast away at conjured spiders to progress.

The game features beautifully melancholic pixel art with a retro vibe and modern aesthetic, bringing the world of Rusted Moss to life with moody pixels and stylish animation. The game also offers customizable strategy and gameplay, multiple endings, and encounters with humans and fae folk who are trying to find their way through the world.

[h1][b][3] Verdict [/b][/h1]
In conclusion, Rusted Moss is a fantastic metroidvania game that provides a challenging and immersive experience with its physics-based grapple, twin-stick shooter gameplay, and engaging story. The game's pixel art and aesthetic add to the overall experience, making it a must-play for fans of the genre.

This game is a MASSIVE step up from the first game in every way. The music, the movement, the effects, the editor, literally everything. All of the tracks are diverse with different genres that one or two might have a special place in your heart, the movement being silky smooth makes the experience much more better and doesn't feel clunky at all, (unlike Soundodger+) the effects give the levels a much more stronger vibe to them and the freedom you have in the editor this time is insane. The game can sometimes not be very friendly with new players I'm gonna be honest and adding the shatter system on top of that can definitely ruin a players experience if they just want to play all of the levels for fun, but for people who want a challenge will most likely enjoy it. I've mostly spent my time on the editor on this game, but the main levels are really fun to play and the challenge level have cool mechanics that challenge your skill in unique and different ways. The easy and normal levels sometimes can feel lackluster, boring, slow, empty, etc. The advanced and expert levels can give you the real fun of the game.

132,136513050.0,2334560,"The concept and art are fine, but the game's mechanics and other design decisions prevent it from being enjoyable to play. 

The protagonist of the tale is a mixed-race fox who aspires to be something other than an alcoholic slacker. Let's just say that the story is quite basic and that your overall goal is to change your destiny.

The game plays like any other action/platformer. You can jump, scale walls, and attack. You immediately realize that the stamina system is involved in all actions, which is fine when done correctly and just for certain acts. However, in this game it’s highly aggravating because jumping also depletes your stamina. Platformers require a lot of jumping, thus you'll spend most of your time waiting for it to fully recharge before making a jump. Then wait once again on the following platform. And again.

The same goes for combat. Each battle becomes a chore due to the very slow recharge. You're moving around wasting a lot of your stamina trying to gather enough for just one hit. When you have enough experience points, you can increase your stats, but you must first kill enemies who use a totally absurd mechanic.

Enemies are brainless. They will follow you anywhere you go if you are in their line of sight, including across ledges, into pits, under spikes, etc. It is usually simpler to lure them into traps, which kill them and leave their corpse hovering in the air.

The game goes with old-school style of progress, which means linear path and no option to revisit stages. Even if stages include numerous paths and secret spots with gold and treasure, it's difficult to collect everything because it's so easy to die. Furthermore, if you just head for the exit, you can make things much tougher for yourself because each coin and experience point is valuable.

The overall difficulty of the game was the final straw that broke my back. There are traps everywhere, coming out of nowhere and taking cheap shots at you. Even if you survive falling into a hole, you most likely won't have the strength to climb out.

What makes this even more annoying is the lack of checkpoints. If you die, everything you collect is lost and entire progress reset. Any kind of exploration is entirely discouraged because you don’t want to spend time by carefully navigating the stage, collecting everything you can and then get killed by a stray arrow.

If you're like me and you're desperate for anything remotely good in VR, this will not suit your needs more than likely. Unless you and a friend are okay with wasting money on a thing you'll probably play for 20 minutes, then, I don't recommend this game. 

The physics is... fine? It's better than most other VR titles, and the full body part is the best aspect of it. However, meleeing with anything feels very bad, there's no sense of impact or collision. You can stick things to other things and make weird things, so in that way it's like GMOD but with like 3 tools. Gun, flight, and sticking things to other things. In it's current shape it's not worth the price of admission, and I couldn't convince any of my friends to get this game, so this is a review from the perspective of someone who put more hours than I'm willing to admit into single player GMOD. 

The interaction spheres appear under alarmingly specific circumstances, the gun interactions are bad/very inconsistent. Even holding things seems wonky, since I picked up two things with one hand, which I don't believe was intentional, because when I dropped both one permanently was stuck to my interaction button, so if I tried to take a mag out of my pocket, it would send me flying toward the corner of the map, since the 'jet' thing was still bound to my hand despite clipping into the ground never to be found again. I experienced this bug within like 15 minutes of play, and it happened to *both* of my hands. It seems like too big of an oversight. 

That being said, if this game got workshop support, fixed their interactions, upgraded melee, and allowed people to make some mini-levels to coop through with your friends (puzzles, combat, etc) or even had a miniture proof of concept coop campaign or even a wave mode, this game might begin to be worth your time and money. I went in with pretty low expectations, and even those weren't met. 

I'm not the biggest fan of Boneworks/Bonelab, but this game needs a few more months of [b]core changes[/b] to come even remotely close to the level of physics and interaction those games achieve. I understand this is likely a much smaller dev team with far fewer resources, but there's a lot left on the table for them to address.

I enjoyed what it had to offer, more so on the character side who are all written well with decent enough motivations. The problem that lies in the narrative is the fact that this is not a game that has concrete ending. I had actually seen a D23 article this morning stating that there will be more Tron games by Bithell Games.
Last bullet point in this article [b] (https://d23.com/decoding-the-grid-a-conversation-with-tron-identity-producer-heidy-vargas/) [/b]

Why this was not said long before the game came out that this would be a multi part story is beyond me. Maybe I missed this information? Someone please correct me if so

Another positive about the story is that choices actually matter, given how many AAA games tote this saying plenty of times without delivering, this deserves to be commended, granted I will say the outcomes of your choices are very obvious and have very little surprise to them but that's fine given the scope of the game.

[h1] Game-play wise [/h1]
There is only type of puzzle which is not at all challenging. It appears quite frequently, almost at every story juncture with a certain character, due to the short run time of the game it thankfully never outstays it's welcome. It can also be skipped if you don't care much about it. 

[h1] Tron wise [/h1]
The tiny little nods and references to the movies (achievement names, certain codex entries) were well done. The new additions to the lore are cool and feel like they fit. World building is very subtle yet it's enough to set the stage of the world but it very much a start for the obvious sequels to come. The music is quite good, it's no Daft Punk or Joseph Trapanese but it's up there and is honestly quite memorable.

The game's controls are responsive, and the progression is well-paced. Throughout the levels, our goblin collects scattered coins which can be spent on upgrades, such as the beloved double-jump. Cleared levels can be replayed at any time, allowing him to access previously unreachable areas with his newfound abilities. For those seeking an extra challenge, the game can be completed without any upgrades, with an achievement as a reward. From time to time the goblin will encounter bosses, which, although easier compared to the levels themselves, are creative and add a nice variety to the gameplay.

An interesting aspect of the game is that all the sound effects are created using the developer's voice, which may initially feel unusual and take some time to get used to. Some players may find it awkward or irritating. However, it's worth noting that the game was made by one person, and this unique approach to sound effects adds to its overall ""hand-crafted"" feel.

It's impossible to die completely in this game. When all continues are lost, the goblin is sent to the Underworld level with infinite attempts (after all, you can't die when you're already dead), and clearing it resurrects him with 15 extra continues. This process can be repeated indefinitely, ensuring that the player won't lose all of their progress and have to start over. However, the game can still provide a challenge, especially for those aiming to collect all the coins.

Overall, this game is a great choice for satisfying old-school platforming cravings. It never gets boring thanks to unique and varied level designs, enjoyable boss fights, appealing pixel art, and just the right amount of difficulty to keep the player engaged. The only minor downside is that it runs at 30 fps due to engine limitations, but it doesn't detract from the overall experience. 
Give it a try – you might just enjoy it.

There are a ton of unique operators to pick from, team based gameplay in which each person fills in their own role, fun co-op missions, various game modes, and no P2W. If you're a fan of third person shooters, tactical shooters, or shooters in general, you absolutely should give Caliber a try.

As someone that has been playing games since the early 90s, I would like to thank the developers for not only listening to the community in order to improve this game, but for making such a game to begin with. Caliber offers up a nostalgic experience, harkening back to a time when shooters weren't mindless, and horribly generic. You've done good, 1C. Keep it up!",1.0

Remember Ghost Recon phantoms? SOCOM? 
Any third person shooter that relies on teamwork?

This is game made for fans of that, if youre BF or CoD player coming here with ""Oh it doesnt have first person"" move along this aint for you anyway.
As a third person shooter this game has it everything you need to enjoy, while animations arent top notch like in GR Breakpoint, this game does it decent enough.
Guns feel good and different.
There is one problem that new players might enncounter and that is famous grind.
New players might get overhelmed by amounnt of grind u need to put out, but this is better system thann it was before, where you would have to buy new operators only with gold (each week u would get 3 new operators that would b availeble for blue credits).
All to all - You like third person? You have time? Dont mind a grind? GO FOR IT!!!

179,136565458.0,2094270,"Lightracer Spark is a visual novel set in a Sci-Fi world. It's pretty much a narrative game where your choices matter as you progress through story. There are also some strategy elements, such as building various buildings, collecting resources, implementing space stations modules etc. I have to say that this game really surprised me how well made it is. 

Story/Narrative:

I have to say that story is quite well written and everything is connected with each other. There is a lot of text to read, a lot of choices to make. Currently you can only play Chapter 1 (new chapters will come as DLCs) that has many mini chapters in it, and as you progress the story, you're able to learn a lot about who you are, what is your mission and what you're capable of doing. Prologue is some sort of Tutorial that shows you and teaches you how to play the game. The other chapters are specific stories that tell you about certain events. Now, the biggest pat of this game is that as Amender (controller of planets and universes) you have specific traits that influence the story. You can pick between 5 different paths and each brings unique traits and bonuses. In the story there will be some choices that you can complete and they have difficulty, ranging from very easy to very difficult. They do somewhat influence the story as it makes you get different ending and you don't collect all the information needed but the higher traits you have, the easier it is to complete them. For example, you'll have to talk about history of certain civilization and to complete that choice, you'll need decent knowledge on ""Strange Worlds"" that is a specific trait in the game. All in all, I have to stay that story is quite unique and it does get you hooked but I just wish that developers added the button that you can speed up the text since most of the time you yourself have to click Continue in order to progress through story and text is quite slow which leaves you enough time to read everything.

Strategy elements:

I personally think strategy elements don't influence the game that much. Yes, you have to collect resources such as energy points, technology points and population in order to complete some chapters, but at the same, you collect those quite fast and buildings are quite cheap to build. You can also upgrade them which allows you to gain resources faster. There are special buildings that do require some effort to build, and they bring you various bonuses and materials that are later required to build certain buildings. In general, it's not time consuming but you'll sometimes forget that they even exist or forget to upgrade them since you're mostly focused on the story. There is also war in this game. I personally think it's quite unfair for other provinces and countries to get attacked by you. Because you're technologically stronger and the higher population you have, the easier it is to recruit troops. Enemies are quite easy to kill and they won't pose a threat. I think it's more beneficial to just focus on your military rater than pure resources. 

Issues:

Even though the story is quite well written, music and images are well made, I can't suggest this game for everyone. First of all, the mechanics of the game are quite easy to master and the game doesn't offer much content. Yes this is visual novel, but at the same time developers could have given us something more unique to do in between the stories and the stories progress way toooo fast. As soon as you're done with one mini chapter, you can instantly go to the other. As I already mentioned, building and waging war isn't anything special and it really doesn't bring you much. Time in the game can be slowed down or fastened up. If you have enough time to read through chapters and chapters of the story and you really do like to immerse yourself in futuristic world where AI helps you with everything, then surely this game is for you.

Pros:
+A lot of game modes, both PvP and PvE. Not all of them are equally populated but you can find a match even in not so popular modes pretty fast.
+Over 60 characters to choose from. Different operators offer different playstyles, some are good for mowing down bots, some are perfect for PvP.
+Nice visuals with decent system requirements.
+No 'pay2win' - all operators can be purchased with ingame currency (and you don't need to grind for weeks to buy one you like).

Cons:
-Visual customisation system are lacking. You can apply different camos to the operator but most ot it can be obtained only during events or for premium currency. Nearly all of the skins with really unique looks are premium.
-Leveling up the operator can be tiresome - later levels require lots of XP and credits to grind.

188,136569545.0,2156300,"I'll preface this by saying, it's still very early, and this is just one episode, but here are my impressions so far.
1.  There are really no options.  You have one woman to impress and god forbid you choose wrong in one of the options you have, she'll friendzone you.  If you didn't find her attractive (and I really didn't--she was too heavy for my taste), then too bad.  She's the only choice in the game so far.
2.  No roll back.  Did you hit one of the choices accidentally?  Too bad. Replay the entire thing, or create tons of saves as you go.
3.  This next one goes towards the ""dating sim"" aspect.  If the one woman pisses you off (which she did), there's no option to tell her to go **** herself and walk off.  You're forced to be nice.  I would really have liked a ""b*tch, I have enough friends"" option.  I've never let a woman friendzone me IRL, and I certainly don't want to do it in a game.  There's great satisfaction in ghosting women like that.
4.  I suppose because it was by the same people that did College Kings, I was expecting at least the chance to have some good, meaningless sex.  That was not to be the case.  I suppose this game is G rated, or PG at best.  My hope is that the more episodes that come out, the more this will change.  I can ""not have sex"" with as many women as I want IRL. There's no need to go to a game to do it.
5.  I both understand and enjoy the necessity to build up to a relationship.  It was my favorite part about games like BaD and College Kings, but both of those games gave you significant feedback when you did something that would cause a girl to friendzone you, or not like you, or whatever, and you weren't friendzoned... you were merely ""in progress"" and the girls kind of let you know that.  In this episode, I got friendzoned and had no idea why.  None.

Again, however, this is all after just one episode.  Perhaps there's still hope and I do look forward to the upcoming episodes, but the lack of a rollback option is just AWFUL!  If you want to add an ""ironman"" mode where you can't rollback, by all means, do so.  I generally do my first playthrough keeping as true to how I would personally answer as I can and some kind of ironman mode for that would be fine, but to force everyone to play that way every time is absurd.

TLDR: As far as the final recommendation, I'm going to say for those seeking an AVN, this isn't it.  This is a teenage visual novel at best... no adult content whatsoever.  The dialogue is fun, even funny at points, but in it's current 1 episode state, I can't in good conscience, recommend it in its current state.  I will update the review as new episodes are released.",0.0

The progression unlocks different tribes (card sets) and some new cards, but the cards you have in the beginning are completely valid to win a run.
Cards can be upgraded in a run to focus on different builds.
The art style is amazing. The UI is great, it runs smooth and the music is incredibly cool.

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Setting & Writing[/h3]
Without much preamble, your non-customizable character is dropped onto a tiny speck of land in the middle of the sea. Soon you notice the ability of creating more squares of terrain around you, and do so to expand the world map itself. There’s no story or lore to speak of, other than you have to survive in the wilderness by any means necessary, as the night is dangerous, while the day is peaceful.

 As much as sandbox games can be far from being story-oriented, the complete absence of any narrative element is a strong malus when there isn’t enough variety to compensate for it. The world itself is composed of tiles belonging to various biomes, each has a colorful and vibrant palette, but also feels static; there are no changes in the weather, and no interactions between confining climates or between animals, monsters and plants. Like a diorama with a few moving parts.

[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]
You’ll explore the world you yourself create on foot, or later on via mounted animals. Speaking of expansion, each new day will have you choose some “cards” belonging to different biomes, to then place them as tiles to expand the map. Each climate has different animals and resources, so varying the composition is fundamental to access all materials for crafting. 

The sense of discovery typical of an open-world survival is largely lost and washed-out, as even after many days the explorable world, including the underground level and the “enchanted dimension”, all matching in size, will still be small in size. You won’t even need a map for orienteering, and there isn’t one. As you roam these tiny expanses, you won’t witness interesting random events, rare spawns or other points of interest spawning at any point. The best you’ll get are goblin traders that you can shelter and house in your base, or animals to kill or capture and breed. The interest wanes after only a couple of hours, as you’ll have seen everything by then.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960459835

[h3]Combat System[/h3]
At night, monsters will spawn on any non-player made tile. The inside of your (hopefully) walled base is safe, but outside the hordes are relentless. Enemies vary per biome: for instance the ice biome will have evil snowmen, the underground caves have explosive spiders, and the enchanted dimension have floating, energy-shooting abominations. The way to defeat each foe  is always the same: kite them in a circle and keep slashing in melee, or wait between shooting patterns for ranged enemies. All of them have one attack pattern and follow mostly the same archetype, with minimal variations.

Your choice of weapons is limited to swords, throwing spears or, if you grind trader reputation enough, slings. Each of them has a single attack, with the sling capable of flinging various crystals and bombs as an exception. Enemies become repetitive and stale not after long, while the combat system simply doesn’t have the depth to keep being engaging. No armors, accessories, upgrades, unique weapons and so on are present at any point. Blocking? Parry? Dodge? Anything? Nah, forget it. Minecraft’s combat system is Dark Souls in comparison to Miniland Adventures.

[h3]Crafting & Base Building[/h3]
You’ll use four main workbenches to get anything done, from flooring to utility buildings, weapons and furniture. The crafting system is the typical one of any open-world survival, requiring you to have a certain amount of basic and processed materials to make a finished product. 

There’s no further elaboration or novelty to it. The economy is kinda broken, to the point I never used anything else than stone tools and Ruby (like Minecraft’s diamond) swords, as metal tools lasted too short compared to the effort to grind the materials to make new ones. Expect to take some time to have a spacious base with all the bells and whistles, even if most craftables are purely decorative or gimmicky - you won’t need them, unless you want to upgrade trader reputation by placing them in their rooms, which isn’t worth it anyway.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960460780

[h3]Trading & Farming[/h3]
Traders offer wares locked behind reputation tiers, gained by furnishing their rooms in specific ways. Some of these items can’t be obtained in any other way, however none of them is really worth the effort. The system exists and is even a decent concept, but has no incentive to be used. 

Farming works in a classic way: plant crops, water them daily or use an automated sprinkler, reap the fully-grown produce and repeat. Of course, some plants may only grow in certain soils or biomes, while animals won’t need care but eat specific vegetables to breed and have more to harvest, like sheep for wool to make an example.",0.0

202,136559848.0,1949030,"This year has been a great period for horror game remakes between Dead Space and RE4, and now even Frogwares seems to be getting on board that train. If you aren't familiar with the older games in this series (like the one this is a remake of), you should know that despite this sharing a lot of the DNA of Chapter One, it isn't an open world game. There are a few small hub areas with occasional small diversions, and if you get the side quest dlc there's some side stuff to do throughout the first half of the game, but for the most part it's more like a traditional point-and-click adventure game campaign (which I consider a substantial plus, considering how poorly their attempts at open world games went). It's adjusted to be less inventory focused in favor of more of the modern investigation gameplay, but the main campaign is essentially one big ""case"", and it took me around 11 hours to get through everything. 

Its adherence to the original material comes as a slight detriment in some parts, because the pacing around the middle of the game was kind of a mess back then and to some extent it still is here, but a lot has been done to tidy things up and smooth over the rough edges. The writing is all around improved, the tone is more consistent across the board, and the story and puzzles have been changed up for the better. And compared to Chapter One, it's honestly just really nice to have Watson back again; I went into their previous game with an open mind towards Jon, but he just didn't have half the chemistry that these two have. There aren't any of Chapter One's unsolvable ""no right answer"" choices, and you never have to gun down a room full of enemies! It's just a fun game all around for mystery fans, and while it's not enough that I don't still miss the Crimes & Punishments style of gameplay and deduction, it's a level of compromise I'm happy to work with.

The original Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened was always a fairly substantial departure from what was normal for this series, injecting all sorts of horror and mysticism into the otherwise fairly grounded universe and then daring you to call it non-canon by bolting itself to the timeline with a single key plot element. I thought for sure that this would end up being more of a reimagining than a remake as a result, with it seeming to position itself as an official sequel to Chapter One, but it doesn't -- if anything, it gets even weirder at some moments, and I wouldn't have it any other way.",1.0
203,136559763.0,1949030,"No, it's still not on the level of Crimes and Punishments. It appears Frogwares just doesnt effin get it. We want the games to be more like C&P NOT what came after it. The design mistakes of The Sinking City and Chapter One are still present though they seemed to have realized the eavesdropping and combat sucked so they have been removed. Once again, you are asked to make choices on guesswork since they could really go either way, things will not be visible because you werent on the right viewmode or were not highlighting the the right clue. Yes, the silly pinning mechanic is still here, and the game wants to be a sequel to Chapter One, constantly referencing it. Chapter One was a mistake that should be forgotten, not referenced multiple times within the first minutes. You already have a foundation to build on, it's called Crimes and Punishments. The mind map has been simplified yet again, and in a more frustrating way that tells you what kind of clues to select and how many, in a much less intuitive or interesting way than select posibilities enabling a logic train of thought like the one in C&P and TDD. The new Mind Map is also ripe for frustration and bruteforcing as you will frequently know what the answer is, just not what evidence it wants as the chain of thought that leads to it (a common problem of detective games), or you know onlt the logic train to an answer and it comes out of Sherlock's ass since the player could not have pieced the finan deduction from the clues. I'm supposed to BE Sherlock, not WATCH and nudge Sherlock. This is not a Watson game.
Also, in that respect, the Imagination mechanic still solves the whole thing for you. You play a game of ordering very vague but still chronologically simple to follow events, but then Sherlock fills in all the blanks sometimes with plenty of information you didnt glean at all or couldnt be sure of. The character does the detective work instead of the player who gets to play a minigame and watch. Yaaaay.
 And once again, side cases either dont get a mind map at all or get an even more simplified one.
Oh, and in a cruel twist of UX, the archive is now accesed by looking at clues. I bet many returning players will try to access it by frantically pacing around the two inches of 221B you can move through repeatedly befroe realizing that. I'm beginning to think the game lacked playtesting.
I'll probably finish it as I'm out of other games but if you were hoping for a return to form, sorry, no. It seems whomever is in charge now plain and simply doesnt get the appeal of the best detective game they made, and has no interest in building on it. They like what I consider to be their worse games too much and will continue on the path they laid foward in them. Shame. Chapter One was a mistake and they are happy to keep making it. Fire whomever is in charge of CO and this pseudo remake and get the people in charge of C&P back on board for the next one.
P.S: Credit where credit is due, the game is really well optimized and while the animations are lacking, the character models for Sherlock and John are great.",0.0
204,136560732.0,2060670,"It starts off promising enough, but having played the full release, I just don't know why you would play this over almost any other competent release in the new genre.

The graphics are neat, and there are a lot of interesting things presented - talents on level up that unlock a new set of talents, choosing your starting basic weapon, the watering thing is neat and the building stuff seems interesting. The problem is, you don't get to interact with it at all. You choose from 4 options on level up, and that includes ""potions"" which are basically temporary buffs. The pool of talents is MASSIVE, and not weighted (as far as I can see). You get 2 rerolls per floor, which amounts to about 8 rerolls per run, which is basically useless for actually trying to do ""a build"". If you choose one of those ""class"" talents that unlock more options (mechanic, ki, etc.) it gets even worse.

Basically all the choices are worthless because, like all these genre of games, you need synergy and multiplicative power to survive, which means just take the most basic, passive stat upgrades, and the basic fish summon skills, and do the same thing every run because everything else requires a staggering amount of luck in your favor to see work. 

You can experiment on the lowest tier difficulty a bit but even then you'll often just run into not killing stuff fast enough which means less xp which means less leveling which means killing stuff slower which means spending 5 minutes after the end of the level timer dodging endlessly while you whittle away the hp of the boss (or you could go onward and forsake even more xp). Oh also you obviously get WAY less rewards at the basic tier. Also unlocking higher tiers requires beating the previous tier, which means doing incrementally less forgiving runs over and over using the same builds over and over because anything else could mean wasting 15-20 minutes of your time and not knowing it until the choices keep failing to happen.

There is a fun game hidden here behind the insane lack of meaningful choices presented to the player.

If you're interested at all, definitely pick this up. It's worth it, and it helps support and encourage the developer while they work on the sequel(s) already underway to continue the story (and shows Disney that good Tron content is worth investing in).

229,136518027.0,2151770,"Fun action roguelike with unique art and interesting gameplay. It starts a bit slow, but gets a lot better once you grab a few perks.

The main gameplay is typical for the genre. You advance through randomly created floors, defeat enemies, gather coins to spend on better goods in shops, and open boxes with perks. Everything is lost upon death, with the exception of special keys and stat improvements.

The unique mechanic is the blue and yellow energy. Numerous things are connected to each energy, and you can change at will. Examples include opponents that can only be wounded with the appropriate energy and chests that open only with the matching color. 

Additionally, some weapons and perks are energy-specific; they simply don’t work if you have the opposite energy. Fortunately, most enemies are in neutral energy, so you won't have to continually switch during combat.

Three keys are unique to each floor and are hidden in unique puzzle areas. These challenges disable your ability to switch between energies but give you doors that, after you pass through them, switch between the two colors. The goal is to push boxes and use doors to reach the final room with the key. 

You keep these keys forever because they let you open unique chests that make subsequent runs a little bit simpler. But the most important is the puzzle room that gives you coins at the beginning of each run.

The reason you want to do that is that items are pricey. It's nearly impossible to purchase anything just by eliminating enemies that randomly drop a chest of coins once you finish clearing out a room. While your starting gun has unlimited ammo, the short range and fun factor just isn’t there because you simply can’t afford a better gun at the start. 

The game's subject is time travel and experiments, therefore each ""floor"" is set in a different time period. Most enemies show up in all the stages, but there are still enough distinct ones to keep the game interesting. Four floors might not see much, but there’s enough content here to keep you busy for a while. A nice addition is a library that gets filled with all the weapons, enemies and perks you encounter.",1.0

Pro:
1- Game looks nice and runs smooth (for me).
2. Good concept but could be lacking longevity or replayability.
3. 3 different mines on the map and map is large although a lot of wasted space

Cons:
1. A lot of the controls are not really explained clear enough- especially when it comes to assigning haulers to diggers. Make sure you assign the hauler first then the digger or you will waste a ton of resources.
2. When it comes to the second and third mine- to load the cargo onto the barge or train- make sure you hit the Q and E key to open and close the scoops. Also was not clear.
3- The drill rig was also very confusing at first- but the arms can rotate outwards much further than it appears. You just have to keep moving them in a circle format to fully extend them. Might be easier on controller but on keyboard it was a chore.
 4. My biggest complaint and an issue I might be overlooking:

Workers do not seem to continue to work if you are not in the mines. At least it seems that way to me. So not much reason to have all 3 mines working. As there is no fast travel and it takes for ever to travel between mines- I think I am going to sell all the machines at the first mine and just concentrate on either the 2nd or 3rd mine. Someone could clarify if I am missing something here.

************************************

I was one of the games playtesters and was fortunate to see the game grow over its development cycle. I have completed the game several times, and currently working through a play through of the release version. Even though my current hours on the release build are low, I am writing with the benefit of knowing what is coming from playing it first hand during tests.

Rusted Moss takes the standard metroidvania with double jumps and replaces it with a challenging but extremely satisfying grappling hook. Some people might find the grapple a challenge at first, but I found as I played more I was able to improve my skill quickly. And once you do.... wow this game really opens up. The satisfaction of landing a sick grappling sequence, or ""breaking"" the game in ways that while intended, allow for a high level of creativity in how you approach the game. Once the game 'clicks', you feel like Spider-Man swinging around as he pleases. The game also has optional climb challenges for those who stray off the beaten path that push the limits of the grappling hook even further. The grapple challenges alone would have justified my purchase as they are extremely fun and allow you to attempt to improve your time, pushing you to be better and better. However, the grapple isn't the only element of the game, and to ignore the other elements would be a mistake as they are also excellent.

The gunplay is tight and satisfying, and playing with mouse and keyboard allows for precise aiming giving me a sense of complete control of my character. When I make a mistake I know it was an execution issue on my end, not a cheap trick from the game. Save points are abundant, which allows you to experiment and go for challenges that otherwise might have seemed too risky. Boss fights have always been the thing I look forward to the most in metroidvanias and Rusted Moss does not disappoint on this front.  I especially love when the grappling hook is integrated into the fight itself as it adds a new element that I have not experienced before this.

The story is an interesting take with morally ambiguous characters, fighting for their lives in a war between the Fae and Humans. With talk of prophecies, secrets, traitors, and double agents, I was fully invested into the story and wanted to progress to find out what would happen next. The music of the game adds to the atmosphere beautifully, immersing me further and further into the game. Going from making me feel transported into the world, to being hyped during a boss fight, or even scared and uneasy in an optional zone that become my instant favourite.

If you are a fan of the metroidvania genre, Rusted Moss is a fresh take with a lot of fun challenges and upgrades to explore. I highly recommend the game, especially to those who ‘click’ with the grappling hook as it opens up the world in a way that I found exciting.",1.0

Now that I've finally played through it (just once so far, though I'm planning on replaying it to make different decisions), I find myself pleasantly surprised. The best Tron game I'd played before this one was either Tron 2.0 or Tron Evolution. I think this one is a lot more interesting than either of those, frankly. It's short, with my first playthrough clocking in around 2 hours, but there's definitely incentive to replay multiple times, as there are several decisions that affect the fates of characters and the roles they play in the story. And at $15, it's hard to be mad about a short runtime.

I really enjoyed the writing and the story here. I think this is the most existential and even political that Tron has ever been, and as a fan of the franchise, it's exciting to see a title that feels eager to dive deeper into the pre-established ideas and see what makes them tick.

This is the first piece of TRON lore that we have received in ten years!!! This is a great visual novel for players who love the genre, love TRON, or both. I'm still going through the game, but with my first play-through, I can tell that the writers took a lot of care and effort into recognizing and expanding on the intricate details of the TRON universe. 

However, the story is shorter than I would have wanted it to be. If you're a fast reader like I am, your play-through should take you 1-2 hours. Wish there was more to unlock and read. The $15 price does not justify this short length. 

Hopefully this is the only the tip of the iceberg for us to receive more TRON content. With the recent opening of the TRON Lightcycle / Run roller coaster at Walt Disney World and a third movie on the horizon, this is (hopefully) just the beginning.

HD version still proccesing!

This new visual novel is more of a romance story that is heavily focused on the stories of the characters present in it and I guess it tries to get the player invested in them too but, personally, I found it boring because from the start of the game all the dialogue was about your 3 friends and their inside jokes that I don't care much about (because there was no build-up to it, just loads of info about characters that I'm not invested in yet). Too much useless information and back-story all at once in the beginning (just my opinion). Other than that the characters look good and detailed, the story don't seem so far-fetched as it is in other visual novels, there are some animations and a lot of images. The price is kinda spicy but it seems that the devs want to release more episodes in the future at no extra charge.",1.0

Furthermore, I think there should be more settings, like the ability to change from downscroll to upscroll, as well as change the scroll speed like in normal rhythm games. It is also quite complex to learn the controls since you need to switch between different attacks while hitting different notes. I believe there should only be light attacks, heavy attacks, and blocks otherwise the gameplay would be too complicated since you would need to fight your opponent while hitting your notes with your other hand. Additionally, the mapping appears out of sync, especially in Vertigo. In order to preserve the true feeling of a singing competition between two great musicians, I believe more hard and upbeat songs should be added. I also find it strange that two people would be fighting while singing, but since that's the point of the game, I think it's fine. Moreover, I believe that different game modes, such as 4K, 7K, 9K, etc., should be added. As a conclusion, I think that hard charts and different genres of music should be added to keep the game from becoming boring and bland, and that more content should be added to allow players to discover what they're good at.

275,136551362.0,1118110,"This game is really good but needs more to do. I have been playing for no more than 4 hours or so and I have nearly collected all achievements, after that is complete I will probably lose interest in this game quite quickly with the lack of content.

THE MAP:
The map is massive with nothing on it but roads. The world is basically just long roads leading to each mine with nothing in between. The garage/petrol station is a good idea but I didn't fill up the car once after the tutorial bit at the very start.

SOUNDS:
The sounds on this are just very bad...I muted my game when playing.

MINES:
All three mines are basically the same with nothing added to them (just a bigger area to walk across to sell coal). So this means that buying the other mines is a waste of time (you only have to buy them to get the achievement). 

WORKERS:
The workers don't actually work. 

MISSIONS:
At one point in the game the mission says "" Now you can build your coal empire"" and it basically stays the same no matter how much you earn, you can't advance any further than this. 

DISASTERS AND VEHICLE DAMAGE:
I am yet to see any disasters in the game which is indicated in the trailer, and no damage at all to vehicles (so it was pointless picking up the tool kit other than to fit that wheel at the start.....which you never have to do again.). If disasters and explosions actually happened I could maybe avoid that happening if I could actually buy a gas detector (The key command is in the menu but you cant buy one) and phones for the mines isn't working either which is also stated in the description. 

FINAL THOUGHT ON THE GAME:
I was going to pay way over the £11 asking price for this as I was looking forward to it....Highly disappointed, really hope the developers have more to add as I believe this game could have been great.",0.0

The game is tough and your deck needs to have solutions for every situation, deckbuilding is much more complicated than just filling your deck up with matching keywords/synergies and winning the run on sheer power. It's worth noting that all of the battles in each run are interesting rather than the ""filler"" battles which many similar games feature.

Finally the theme/artwork are top notch and there is plenty of content to unlock to give the game some longevity!

298,136577403.0,1685730,"The game has a pleasing aesthetic and atmosphere to it. The journey takes us from colorful, vibrant landscapes, into medieval dungeons and murky swamps, which presents a welcome change of scenery and mood for each chapter.

The soundtrack is well done, each chapter has its own theme that fits the level and surrounding area, and the audio queues for being close to enemies or being spotted add some tension to the stealth gameplay.

The puzzles are well integrated into the levels, they're not too easy but also not very difficult, which makes it a chill experience while still offering a bit of a challenge. 

The stealth segments of the game have a good pacing to them, the levels aren't just extended sneaking sections, but a healthy combination of stealth and exploration with some puzzles thrown into the mix for some variety in gameplay.

I played with mouse and keyboard. The game is also compatible with controllers and joysticks. All controls can be remapped to your liking.

The game isn't very long. You can probably finish it in about 2 hours. I messed around a bit which lead to me spending close to 4 hours in the game. However, the game being short is definitely not a negative in this case. I think that overall the chill atmosphere and semi-challenging gameplay makes for a cozy experience on a rainy afternoon.

The game has some bugs in it, which is to be expected from a new release, especially one made by one developer and one 3D artist. Some of them have already been fixed in the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1685730/view/3719451786611878892] 1.0.1 hotfix [/url] that was released within a day of the launch.
Most of those bugs are and were extremely minor nuisances but nothing really game breaking. Most could be fixed by simply reloading the latest checkpoint, which the game has a good amount of, so you don't really lose much progress.

Cynthia comes across various collectibles throughout her journey, which offers some replayability should you have missed some. The ability to select and replay levels after completing the story would be a welcome addition, since there is no way to go back to get a collectible you might have missed other than starting a new game, which deletes your previous save.


What I didn't like as much was the dissonance between the character models. Cynthia, as the player character, has great quality model with physics and a neat selection of cool outfits to collect along her adventure. However, the other NPCs, while not looking too bad, are of noticeably lower quality than Cynthia. It makes sense to have the player be more refined than the NPCs we don't see as often and up-close too much, but it is still a bit jarring during cutscenes to go from Cynthia to an NPC.

The final boss fight was underwhelming and over before I knew it, I was hoping for a bit of a more elaborate final battle.
It sadly felt a bit rushed.

This one in particular seems to allow an absurd amount of customization in the way you link your weapons. It's really hard to explain in text and something that comes across better by just trying it out! Based on how you set up your links, your new upgrades can affect yourself, your enemies, your other weapons, or for example, your other weapons that proc off of hitting your other enemies, and so on and so forth (like an example - you can have a sword swinging from yourself, that inflicts poison on an enemy, that releases a nova burst every second, that inflicts a burn on enemies, which triggers something else to happen when it blows up, and so on).

I'm really not know all about Deck building game so I can't pointing out on if this is a good game for that genre or not. But I can given you a detail on what you'll get on this game.

- Deck building game: Everything is card, Including you and you companions.
- On your journey you can pick a cards  to assisting in your journey, So don't worry, You'll have a lot of cards.
- Which also mean you have to building your own deck. The card consisted of Weapons, Companions and Equipments. Playing each card will subtracting a turn on both you and the enemies. Any card hit zero first get to hit first.
- So its basically a game of wits where you'll have to manage the card you'll play before your team gets to hit  the enemies turn by turn. And trust me, Its not that easy at all. and you are going to losing alot.......This is where Rouge lite elements come into play.

1. At the beginning of each match, You'll get to pick 1 out of 3 randomize heroes.  Each will have different hit point and Health point. Also some of them will come pack with the effect such as Barrage (Hit all enemies in the same row) etc. etc.

2. You'l die. ALOT. Which if you are able to complete certain objective on each match. You'll progressively unlocking the building on your starting point. Allow for better equipment, companion and pets (And more)

So basically, This game is best because you can swooshing in and out for a quick rush and just leave when you thing just gone down hill and coming back later for better tryout. Its really fun especially when you just want to have something casual and still feeling serious at same time.

I played about 150 hours in the standalone years ago. I decided that I should start playing again because now it's on Steam. They have done so many quality of life improvements that you new players can enjoy. The bullcrap system with the ""mobile game"" like daily where you send your operators to collect stuff is gone. There used to be so many currencies you had to grind and now the only basic silver & fragments is enough with the premium currency. Grinding operators to get better before was insanely boring, tedious and annoying. Now it's simple and much better. Straight line and you just spend the free to play currency to activate new talents. 

Graphics are good and so are about 80% of the legendary operator skins. There are few goofed up stuff but rest are some old school gear and then some tactic00l af stuff. Pick the operator you like, read what their skills do and enjoy. Store updates weekly that which operators are on discount. 

To all new players, please play the tutorial. I play medic 90% of the time so please, don't run away from me. If you need the heals, go to the medic or stay near the player and if the skill requires a chain or AoE don't leave it. Don't spend your syringes that much since medic can carry 6, save your one syringe when it all hits the fan. 

I never liked the PvP and never gonna play it. I just love to grind the simple PvE maps and modes. 

It's not perfect though, the new voice acting in some maps that are totally redone with ""story"" cutscenes etc. is so abysmal that you may want to mute your dialogs. It is just disgustingly bad. Some random voice actor doing stereotypically bad accents. Should have just stayed with the vanilla voices like in the old maps. There are also some really meta operators for PvE which are just hilariously OP and can carry the whole match. Bourbon is disgustingly OP as hell with Kit. 

It is a good free to play game and it is improving more and more. Glad they improved so many quality of life aspects needed in the game, the previous currency grind made me quit but now I can just casually play again and progress.",1.0

After playing this game for a long time, and having a peak in Super Test environment I can tell you, honestly that this team isn't competent  and they blatantly lie. For example this year was supposed to be without any new units, however, they need money again so they're adding two more. They increased the price of everything, just to milk people dry.
Their battlepasses were around 40 to 60 euros depending if you want to complete it fully, and the mod team would make fun of COD for having 10 dollar BPs that were cosmetic, while Caliber had literal pay to win collections for over 30 euros..

I was once harrassed and DDOSED by the people i played against, provided literal video footage, however ScumbagJuJu who is the lead moderator, shut me up and never said anything to the russian players that literally attacked me verbally and my hardware.
Another instance was where i was unrighfully banned by a moderator, where he promised a certain channel, then acted dumb and demanded i prove it or he will mute me for a certain amount of time, when i did prove it with a screenshot i asked him does he need more proof or will he stop  eating shit, which he promptly muted. Of course he was scolded by ScmubagJuJu because he was in no right to do so, yet he did. 

The player feedback isn't listen to, believe me, for four years we put up with their lack of balance and bullshit updates to avoid doing anything. They release a new unit, make it broken, literally pay to win, milk them for a few months and then somewhat nerf them.

I've played every game mode, I have a decent amount of earned premium skins and all opeartors [besides the new pay to win americans and chinese] a lot of time spent in game as well. 
Their rules are so bad, you can get banned, now let me repeat, you can loose your account, for Tbagging an enemy and or friendly. That was also one of the questions i was asked when they asked me for super testing "" How would i feel if someone tbagged me"" where i answered i'd find it funny, cuz it's all in good faith and gaming fun.

THIS IS NOT YOUR REGULAR FPS SHOOTER  !!! 

A very Story Driven Game , Story is pretty solid 

There is actually 2 Endings to it so you can say you have to make a choice at somepoint 

Very Unique Game modes where you fight in 1 vs 1 against CPU in various levels 

Not very long game , I d say it will take like 4 Hrs to finish both the endings 

Overall fun and unique 

Price is also very fair

One of the standout features for me was the ability to choose from a variety of classes to create a diverse and dynamic party. It added an element of strategy and allowed me to approach battles in different ways.

Another standout feature was the warcamp, which was a unique and useful addition. It allowed me to manage resources, recruit new members, and interact with NPCs in a way that felt organic and immersive. I appreciated the option to choose between playing as a lawful character or embracing a more criminal lifestyle, which added a layer of moral complexity to the game.

344,136576847.0,1527950,"I'm really on the fence about this game. When I got it as the very early and incomplete version, it was awesome, arguably the best ""tactical RPG"" I know, even devoid of many features. But, as the versions progressed and the changes were made, it became worse. Today, probably hours away from release, it's... just another tRPG, I guess. With a couple interesting ideas and a number of annoying problems, just like most games.

The changes themselves are quite subtle. (sorry for long explanations, it's fairly intuitive when you actually play).
As an example, there is a very nice implementation of turn order: both your and your opponents' men are ""distributed evenly"" in the turn order for the round, so if the number of combatants is equal, you and enemy take turns acting with a single fighter, until all fighters act. However, for the AI, the order of its units acting is fixed, while you can act with any of your guys (who didn't act in this turn yet). While ""unfair"" towards the AI, it provides many interesting choices and tactics.
Now, if the enemy has twice as many people as you do, for each of your actions, they make two. So, even if you kill (or otherwise deal with) the guy who acts next (the obvious choice), another enemy will act after that and probably you'll be in some trouble. So, the difference in numbers turns out to be very, very important.
What did they change? Now, the number of your enemies is always quite close to yours, and in cases it somehow isn't, the extra units will arrive later (when you already killed many enemies) as reinforcements. So, the (rightfully dreaded) experience of being outnumbered is cut off from the game. Now, a lot of battles follow the same pattern: you neutralize the enemy who acts next, then he doesn't do much (or anything at all, if killed), rinse, repeat. A hundred of perfectly forgettable battles. 

I could write several such examples, including camp management, economy, fog mechanics. The early versions did convey the right experiences: you struggled to stay afloat with money, thoughtfully picked your contracts, took care of your men. But the updates made the game progressively worse. My best guess is, the game designers knew what they are doing and made bold (and really good!) decisions, but then some salespeople took over the game and made it ""accessible for wider audience"" or something - just another game.

UPD. The release actually happened while I was writing this. Congratulations! Despite all I wrote above, kudos for actually going all the way to the finished game, I know it's hard work.",0.0

The developers are doing an excellent job of listening to the community and continually adding new content, which is very impressive. However, I have noticed lack of optimization issues with Nvidia, causing the game to stutter for few secs during your turn in combat.

There's so much going on in this game that I keep dumping long hours into it. Yeah, it's definitely not a fast paced game that everyone is going to enjoy. Some of the fights I've run into more early on in the game have taken long periods of time both in setup/strategy and because of the turn-based nature of the game. It'll take a couple of tries to get things right starting out and it's pretty easy to lose companions if you're not paying attention to everything that's going on.
Micromanaging your wages, food and companions' relationships is challenging and rewarding, making the overall hardcore feeling of the game much more appealing for players like me. Screw up positioning and lose your favorite archer, maybe save scum a few times to try finding a better starting position. There's a lot to soak up when you first start and there's definitely a bit of a learning curve, which makes it more entertaining and challenging.

Cannot wait to see where the game ends up going from here. Really enjoying what's there and I've only unlocked one other region so far, so there's plenty of stuff for me yet to do. I've tried a few groups so far and end up going back to the first one I created where I'm the furthest and in a definite money problem (though, I always forget to grab some prisoners - which is a pretty decent way to fund everything), sometimes a food issue, but my troop is getting stronger every time I sit down to rampantly play.",1.0

The fact that there is no initiative and any character can move when it's your turn (and vice versa for the enemy) feels silly. The starting positions in most fights also don't make a ton of sense to me. The talent trees are too shallow and it feels like some classes are much stronger than others. 

The 'campaign'/story is nice, but the battles become repetitive fairly quickly. I stopped playing sometime during the third region and haven't felt like picking it up again.

371,130149997.0,1527950,"The basic premise of the game is that you control a changing party of mercenaries and seek your fortune in a low-fantasy open world. As this is essentially the same premise as Battle Brothers, which I'm very familiar with, I'm going to compare the two in my review. I think a lot of people who will be interested in this newer game (still EA) will have already tried Battle Brothers, so such a comparison may be helpful to them.

Compared to BB, this game has a much greater sense of REALISM; every experience is more immersive. Instead of moving your party's icon across the map, you will see your group of members, complete with their beast(s) of burden and wagon(s), walking across the world itself. There are lots of points of interest in the world for you to interact with, including resource deposits to collect, groups of travelers of different factions, towns to visit, tombs to explore, etc. Most locations allow for you to search for things, sort of like a hidden object game. When you enter a town, there are multiple locations to visit, but they're a bit more involved than simply a menu with a list of options. Sometimes there are puzzles or quests involving multiple people, and in many cases you'll have to choose which faction to side with. Rather than hiring non-combat followers like BB, each of your companions can choose a profession which is very useful for the party as a whole; for example, you can designate someone to be a cook, which will enable them to cook recipes from food ingredients, and someone else to be a miner, allowing them to extract ore from mines. Most professions are associated with a mini-game; an angler has a little game in which you try to keep a fish on the line. The crafting system involves gathering resources from many sources: from town shops, from travelling merchants, from harvesting natural deposits, from skinning defeated animals; and then unlocking recipes that can be completed in your camp or in a dedicated workshop. The sheer number of things to do, and the way they all connect and benefit your team - it's a very impressive system. In terms of the fantasy element: if BB is a ""low"" fantasy world, this seems to be a ""lower"" fantasy world. If there is any sort of magic (beyond certain alchemy potions) or fantastic creatures (beyond a humongous rat) in this game, I have not discovered it yet.

GRAPHICALLY, the game outshines BB in every way. All people have full 3D models; all movements, battle skills, etc. are fully animated, and they're done so very well. I'm not knocking Battle Brothers here at all; it simply focuses on gameplay and doesn't endeavor to do a whole lot graphically, and people who enjoy it aren't looking to be wowed with graphics. That said, this game does, and uses the graphics for full immersion in a very impressive way.

The COMBAT is comparable to Battle Brothers, each having strengths and weaknesses. One of my favorite things about both games is that everybody can die. For real. For good. If you suck and let one of your guys die, they're dead. Gone. Bye bye. When I said your party is *changing*, that's what I meant: if you bite off more than you can chew, they'll be pushing up daisies in no time, and you'll have to recruit replacements. That said, combat in this game is *slightly* more forgiving, in that there's a mechanic applied to all your characters that essentially gives them the ""nine-lives"" perk from BB; that is, if they would be killed by a blow the first time, they survive it for a moment but will die for real if they take any more damage before they are healed. ""Healed"", meaning a realistic first aid skill that doesn't magically put them back to full health - it stops bleeding, burning, etc., and gives them a few hitpoints. A major difference between this game and BB is that battles are affected very little by RNG rolls; it rarely determines whether attacks hit or miss. (It does affect the order that enemies take their turns, as well as damage output for most skills.) Another major difference is that the tactical maps are not hex-based; they are based on realistic distances. Characters, depending on their movement ability, may be able to move up to, say, 10 meters. Positioning is very important, as different skills and weapons have different ranges (in meters). There are also natural hazards for certain tactical maps, such as falling rocks in caves, or lightning strikes during storms. (I actually find that these detract from the realism a bit, however, for two reasons: #1 in real life, they don't happen often enough to be a real factor in any battle of this size; #2, you get a preview of the AoE for these hazards before the turn, so you know exactly where and when they will occur, and you have plenty of time to get your guys out of the way.) In all, the combat feels very good in this game. I'm delighted to tell you that I screwed the pooch about 20 times before I finally figured out how to keep my guys alive.

Your COMPANIONS can be recruited from inns, from prisons, or other sources, such as solving a dilemma a certain way or completing a quest. You can also take prisoners and force them to do your bidding, including even taming most animals in the game and having them fight for you. Unlike BB, they have classes rather than backgrounds; the classes determine what options are available when they level up, so the customization doesn't feel quite as flexible as BB. You cannot equip any armor/weapon on any class. Only an Archer can use a bow, and he/she can't use anything else (that I'm aware of); in the event that they are forced into a melee attack, they can only use their fist to punch for a couple points' damage. The Ranger class is essentially a ""rogue"" from most RPG-type games. They can only wield a knife and an option off-hand weapon. I'm not sure why he's called a ""ranger"", as his primary weapon is not ranged and he doesn't really have any connection to nature or animals. As far as the uniqueness of characters' appearance, there are about 5 faces, 5 hairstyles, 5 beards, 5 hair colors, etc that you can choose from. So you can customize... just not a lot. However, companions can be either male or female, though I'm not sure of the full implications of this, or if it's simply an aesthetic choice. As you progress through the game, events can happen (like in BB) where characters acquire new traits or even promotions. When you hire someone, you don't know how exactly they will end up a month down the road.

PROCEDURAL GENERATION: This is the main area where BB triumphs over Wartales, as it has a fully generated, randomized world for each game. This is the main reason why I have over 4000 hours in it: it's hugely replayable. In comparison, the world of Wartales and most things in it were manually designed. RNG does affect some things from game to game, such as which items are available for sale at different locations, where/when some resources will appear, who will be travelling where and when, the order that quests will appear, etc. However, the world is otherwise a map of the same area from game to game. You can re-play the game with different characters, strategies, skills, and whatnot, and you can unlock different starting areas as you progress through the game; however, you will still be playing the same world, and you'll know all locations, stories, main quests, and decisions ahead of time, provided that you've discovered them before in an earlier playthrough. In my opinion, this is the only real drawback to this game compared with BB; but for me, it's a major one.

That said, this is a very fun, high-quality game with a ton of stuff to see and do and try out. What the developers set out to do, they have achieved remarkably. And it's still only Early Access - you can bet it's only going to get better as they continue to add more of the same.",1.0

Ware tales however is just difficult. Don't get me wrong, i enjoy a game that seriously stresses my mind. I wait with anticipation for Frostpunk 2. However when a game artificially makes its setting difficult for the sake of being difficult, no thanks...
Number of points.
1 Game economics are terrible. You can tell the economic capability of a game like this based of the craft cost. A crafted item should generally be worth more than the base components that went into it. This can vary if there is a price change due to quantity in a market (not for Wartales). When i went over the general prices for many crafted items, about 1/3 to 1/2 are just straight out less cost effective than their base components. This is disheartening to see at the start of a game. I didn't even factor in the general cost of acquiring the items in terms of party upkeep. You can grind the game out and make progress with the system possibly. That was just a massive red flag for me right away.
2 Combat is completely unbalanced. I know, people with tell me that it was fine for them, just use strategy, or if you do it this certain way than its just fine. A game like this should reward you for thinking tactically, not demand it. I don't enjoy spending an abundant amount of time strategizing on each tedious fight. Also if you are fighting same level enemies as you, the general expectation is that their capabilities will be the same. If the enemy can do double my damage at the same level and class, that's an artificial difficulty adjustment for the sake of being difficult. I don't enjoy it, and i don't enjoy being given paltry rewards for it. At least one wound at least per encounter for me, costing me at least 20 in craft good cost for a medicine, reward worth about 15 or 20. Just disappointing after the effort.
3 The story is lost in the survival. Any semblance of story that you might come across gets lost in the desperation to simply survive. You will make decisions based on your current needs more than on your morals at the start. Maybe this is the tale they are trying to convey. That life looses meaning when you stop living and just survive. Well they are right and that, in the end, is why i didn't exactly enjoy this game. I play games to live, not simply survive.",0.0

399,119492306.0,1527950,"This game is AMAZING. It's a Early Access game yet, but for anyone that enjoys slow paced mercenary group kind of game (yes, if you like Battle Brothers you'll probably love this) this is a GEM. 

60 hours into it and have only fully explored 2 of the 4 (5?) regions available until now, the other 2 are almost untouched, yes I'm taking my time to explore and grow my group but still, that's a lot of content and things to do in a EA game. I'll probably take another 60hours to finish all the content currently avaiable and wait anxiously for more. 

The combat is very in-depth and even in Normal it's a welcome challenge, a lot of factors to take into account because each and every encounter is different, different mini-bosses, deployment and so on. Every single fight I have to think about what I'm doing, if I rush in head on even on lower level encounter I can get a guy killed. 

There is a lot of skills and especializations in the game, each of them bring something new to the table and makes you adapt to each situation depending on the guys you have. Nice crafting system, altough the weapons and armours you can craft gets pretty old when you reach lvl 6 and start dropping higher level stuff. They are still very much useful nonetheless. 

The only complain I have is the pathing system in the world map, you get stuck a lot but it's ok. I wasn't expecting to be so hooked up on the game since is EA, but the devs made an awesome game so far. It's well worth the price if you ask me, ESPECIALLY because the devs are apparently keeping up with the roadmap with almost no delays. I wholeheartedly recommend this game, in a era of awful and shallow AAA games as well as a flood of indie companies doing mini games to stay afloat, Wartales is gigantic breath of fresh air!

Wartales is a turn-based combat (XCom style) squad RPG, with a solid amount of content, interesting storylines, fun and challenging gameplay.  Unfortunately, there are still several bugs that range from mildly annoying to game-breaking.  By far the worst (at least on my system) is the chance to crash the entire computer upon entering any town marketplace (happens about 25% of the time), which also often corrupts both the auto-save and manual saves from that game.  I have one campaign 15 hours in, but due to that crash and save corruption, I can no longer play it.  Incredibly frustrating.

437,109836280.0,1527950,"Hm...  42hrs in my first playthru.  

42hrs in the first area alone.  
I felt like with the EA, I hit the limit with my team too quickly.  Got the hang of the whole, fight, run home, repair, eat, fight, run home, repair, eat, etc. fairly quickly.

As ambitious the concept of Wartales sounds like, I couldn't really feel emotionally attached to my team/character as I would in games like Kenshi, Mount & Blade, Crusader Kings, etc.  I didn't really feel attached to the mini-stories around the area as well.  I was excited to play the story of farmers wanting more with life but once I started playing, it felt like your backstory has nothing to do with how you play or how it dictates the world.  A game title like ""Wartales"" feels like a ""Play the way you want to with the backstory you want"" type game.  But this is just purely, fight, loot, repair, eat, sleep, repeat.

Oh, uhm.. once I figured out how to effectively and efficiently craft items for trade, it added an additional 10hrs of gameplay of renewed excitement realizing I could make more money by crafting from random loot and selling the crafted items. But then I hit my limit again once I managed to consistently stay over 1000 gold or so.

After all that and completing the first area and moving to the second, I felt like I hit a wall to play this game as it felt it's a rinse and repeat regardless of the region you're in or the background of your team.

Overall, this EA reminds me of other EAs I played where I play for a solid week or two and then hit a hard stop for many years as it just didn't feel wholesome or satisfying.  I guess I'll keep TRYING to play a bit more to see what else I can uncover..

I don't really thumbs down games but would definitely give this game a ""MEH"" for now.
Maybe other users have a more fulfilling and exhilarating experience instead?

Instead of thinking they cant switch, OFC the ability to move your fighters around is obvious but personally i didnt know you could switch fighters at will at the start of combat AND during combat aslong as they havent spent their action. Until i had played the game for a little while. Personally i think there should be a more "" DND "" aspect to the game where the initiative during combat will be based on skill ""and/or dice"" if you decide to implement that in the game.

Running on the world map should be a basic skill that you shouldnt have to spend points on in my opinion, because the fighters are grown ass men and women :P 

I also think that the cooking and the raw material production in camp should be increased to maybe 3 - 5 per rest, at least for a time when you start the game. 

Some paths in the game / on the world map, was pretty wierd to be honest :P

 SPOILERS AHEAD !!!! 

When you go on the mission to kill the colonel alex or (insert name). There should be a tutorial or atleast a hint that the player can plant a piton from their inventory manually. 

Also the mission to go into the ancient tomb or crypt, I only found the path to the place because i saw some random NPC's running in a wierd way down the hill :P but the torch ""preperation hint"" was good :)

You are a band of deserters, bandits with the potential to become unwanted...or ??, or just some farm boys out for fun, that's just 3 of the 5 starting bands of 4. In the end you are mercs or bandits, or a trader, you can even be a cannibal with a pack of hogs you feed instead of regular folks. The game is very open, with lots of side quests, so much so that I don't want to spoil it as it's so new and so many are finding new ways to survive and explore. The devs also have a strong rep, and have produced some very good games, so looking forward to more content. Right now there are 3 provinces I have found,  trade is possible between them, but you will need to protect you goods. Another good money maker is bounty hunting, take prisoners and sell them, but there us a limit. The game is pretty well balanced and does not play like an EA at all, other than lacking voice actors it's pretty polished, the world is quite immersive with each province having it's own main story line....I think they all tie together, trade control seems to be a main motive?

EDIT: Tutorial and tooltips have been added in the Comunity patch for December 2021. Once the autoleveling is addressed too, they will have my thumbsup

It's true. You currently have a lot of gameplay due the big map it already includes. You will really enjoy the early game once you have finished struggling figuring out how everything works, because it's not only there is no tutorial at all, it's that they have not even included tooltips or explanations for all the minigames involving crafting. 

And this is one of the cons I see in this game. It doesn't give you any feedback, you don't know any details about the character classes, which weapons they may use or what abilities will be unlocked when promoting one of your companions to captain or lieutenant. First times you promote someone it’s a guess game adventure, like getting a new crafting recipe for a weapon (no, brutes can’t use axes… seriously?).

The other big reason to not recommend Wartale right now there is no mid or late game content. You can only advance until level 5 and, after that, your companions will randomly get skill points whenever they get a nickname (it may occur several times for the same one and, guess what, the game doesn’t explain why or when nicknames are earned or changed). The only thing that escalates the game is the autoleveling of all the enemies around, which is only useful to generate more of the same with the difference that you will get combats of half an hour or 1 hour instead of the aprox 15 minutes during the early game. Spending almost one hour fighting superboars over and over again in epic battles is not fun, it’s repetitive and boring.

Nevertheless, there are around 10-15 hours of early game quite enjoyable and fun (learning process included). You should do the math if that’s worth 35 € EA for you… But do it in advance, by the time you have learned the game and have passed the exciting first date and start facing reality (the repetition of endless battles), you will not be eligible for a steam refund anymore.

this game seems to be the good old plantera, with a bit more of content and a slight better looking pixel art.

I thin this is the first review I've ever written on steam, and I'm writing it for this because this is an awesome developer and I have loved playing it. I started playing at the beginning of early access and have (so far) put ~200 hours into it.  

This is a thoughtful, and well constructed game. Lots of role playing opportunities and great replay opportunities. My only complaint WOULD have been that the end game becomes a bit too easy, as your troop becomes a bit overpowered, but in the release they have made some small adjustments to combat and so this should be (if you are looking for a challenge) a great turn-based strategy combat. 

The economics are great as well. 10/10 would recommend, and I've only had to kill and eat one of my group once...",1.0

The graphics and music were beautiful and each of the characters had pretty believable motivations. The puzzle sections were also pretty cool and built up in difficulty organically.

506,136603177.0,1772830,"Rusted Moss is a charming game that oozes atmosphere, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But it has several problems. For a 20 euro game, it feels unpolished, like an early access title. I would honestly have preferred to pay 30 for a more polished version of this game.

The Bad:

First, the game is marketed as a twin-stick shooter. But booting the game up it told me to use mouse and keyboard, rather than controller. Using my PS4 controller, the game also doesn't show me correct button symbols, and does not let me bind certain controls to certain buttons (I have not tried using Steam's controller support for this game since many games reliably fail to show correct button symbols.)

Second, the game is marketed as a metroidvania. However, in playing it for six hours I found that the movement system, while rich and with a high skill ceiling, does not properly tutorialize several mechanics and does not properly encourage experimentation because of its difficulty. The level design does not adequately communicate which traversals are possible with the player's current skill set. With my disabilities, I found myself wondering which parts of the game I was 'allowed' to use the fly assist to bypass, and which I was supposed to be gated from entering for story progression reasons. Additionally, in six hours of playing and defeating three major bosses, I found a distressingly small amount of new abilities: the grapple, the high jump, a different gun, and grenades; there were plenty stat upgrades to be sure, but no genuine additions to the kit.

Third, the game is positively punishing in difficulty. This isn't a problem as such, but it is executed in frustrating fashion. The high-skill traversal system makes certain stretches between save points feel like unforgiving gauntlets, both because of the platforming and the enemy ecounters. This is exacerbated greatly by the fact that all progress since last save is lost upon death: all rooms explored, all collectibles found, all lost upon death. For certain collectibles, this made it harrowing to return to a save point.

Fourth, the combat system feels less than fun. The guns have great sound design and interesting firing modes, but the range is so short it feels like artificial difficulty. Since movement is so high-skill as well, this eliminates the greatest advantage the player would otherwise have: positioning. It makes regular enemy encounters feel like a hazard to avoid, in a game that hands the player a machine gun in the first ten seconds. Also the fact that grenades and healing use the same resource just serves to punish the player and disincentivize using the weapons available.

Fifth, there's a couple of minor annoyances. Mostly there are no genuine secrets to find, hidden walls and the like; but I have managed to find at least one instance of a genuinely hidden item close to the starting area, which felt very out of place. It is also possible to unintentionally skip non-repeatable dialogue, and there's no log of previous conversations to review in case that happens. For a game with such a detailed assist menu, it feels rather patronizing that the only option for circumventing platforming troubles is straight up flight; extra grapples in the air would have been a welcome addition, again like Celeste. Also the auto aim just plainly doesn't work.

The Good:

First, the writing. The character dialogue is execellent and genuinely funny. The worldbuilding is compelling and the story isn't front-loaded. Fern and Puck have a pre-established dynamic, and the story begins in medias res after an apocalyptic event, the details of which the player has to uncover. It is a refreshing work of fiction. (The only thing that frustrates me is how the grim tone clashes with the fact that the bosses are mostly left alive and hale for some reason. Would to me make more sense if they died in the battle, or at least were shown to be injured in some way in the aftermath, but that's a nitpick.)

Second, the aesthetic presentation. The graphics are gorgeous, the pixel animation style is well executed and feels nostalgically retro in all the right ways. I am in particular smitten with how each biome has a distinct color tint to the menu; very atmospheric. The animations are solid, the character design is varied and interesting, and the enemy variety is diverse despite all of them being machines. It reminds me of other great works such as Risk of Rain and Hyper Light Drifter.

Third, the music is wonderful. It sets the mood of each area without being intrusive, and it is definitely worth buying the OST download if you like listening to video game soundtracks.

Conclusion:

Rusted Moss is a action-horror platformer with exploration focus. It sets the player up against armies of enemies that the arsenal does not adequately address, and rewards avoiding combat and conserving resources more so than proficient combat. The story is dark, bleak, and apocalyptic, with the player fighting on the side of an inhuman, callously uncaring evil. It struggles with gameplay, but excels in story and visuals.

507,136601816.0,2109430,"It is a VN with puzzle elements. 
Loved Tron as a kid, have not kept up with any lore since the Legacy movie and felt lost a couple times with some of the language but it didn't effect my enjoyment of the game. My first playthrough was maybe 2 hours so it is a short game, however it is the brevity of the game that makes it likely I will replay to try and get a different ending (since choices I may have made contributed to a few too many deaths ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).
Music is good, graphics are Tronish and the story is a standard detective tale. Not entirely sure on how I feel about the puzzles, at first they didn't make sense but by the end they were pretty simple.
I think it was worth the $22 loonies it cost me but I can very much see how others will see it as overpriced.

512,136601407.0,1893370,"So I'm split on this so far. I think this game is doing a lot that I really enjoy: the movement, guns (mostly), aesthetic, and music. 

But some things feel off:
- Mainly most of the maps I've played have felt really small for an arena based game, it often felt like I had way more movement than I needed for the scale of these areas. I know it wasn't an issue of movement because in the more open maps things felt fine. Side note for wall jumping: I think this feature is severely underused. I don't think there was a single instance where I felt that wall jumping would be useful or the better tech option over slide jumping. Just something to consider.
- Then there was the issue of the friendly AI: either the friendly AI is able to essentially play by itself (one flag CTF), or was pretty much useless (Control mode). I would find the AI just sitting in a corner doing nothing or bum rushing the objective and dying almost immediately. This forced me to have to essentially play both the role of offense and defense, though mainly defense. 
- The story thus far has been rough in its' presentation. Too much is thrown at you way too quickly, and my understanding of the world is nonexistent. Your character, Molly, literally spawns into the world and is immediately informed that she is some form of undead that has been brought back to life to compete in arena shooter style combat. Cool, great launch pad for some interesting cyberpunk/hackerman energy. But very quickly after your first clue that things are not what they seem, the story ramps up way too fast without any build up. You're introduced to a cast of character that you very quickly realize don't have a whole lot to do outside of being unique skins for the AI to use in combat. I got the sense that these characters  are supposed to be the main cast you're dealing with, but they have next to nothing to do or say - I just don't care about them. Only one of them gives off a memorable first impression and that's because you have to kill him in the arena. The story also introduces a character that further calls into question the things that have been going on, except the issue is that you haven't had a long enough time to actually see what things are normally like in this world to actually question what had been established. Going forward I would recommend that the story team be a little more patient with showing their hand. Just establish the world that Molly first spawns into: who brought her here, what is their reason, where is she, who are these other characters, what are the basic rules of this world? Let the player understand SOMETHING and have a reason to care about it before you try and subvert what you've established, or begin adding in stakes for characters that I don't have a reason to care about.
- This is my last issue, but it is related to story: the dialogue. It is often ROUGH. The tone is jovial and light, but it is entirely at odds with everything else. The humor is pretty shallow and frankly I wished it was toned down a lot. The dialogue between characters is pretty pointless. It gives you pretty much no extra information about the characters or the world. They seem entirely disconnected from everything going on around them.
- Final thing: The pistol feels off, I don't know if its damage or rate of fire (for either firing mode), but it felt wrong in comparison to every other weapon. Not a huge deal, maybe I just need more time with it. 

In conclusion: I like this game a lot. Playing the game was fun, and though the story hasn't impressed me, almost all of the elements they've introduced in the story are, or could be, really interesting. I have my issues but ultimately I want to see more. SO KEEP GOING DEVS! YOU GUYS HAVE SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL HERE :)

The mood detector is a really cool feature that I think adds a lot to the interactions, especially alongside the characters expressions and effects. The dialogue itself is interesting and you're given a lot of options to respond to characters with. Sometimes your choices aren't obvious, and I really enjoy that.

The music and the style of this game both come together really well to create very immersive, very good looking settings.

There were some issues based around the timed repairs. digging for the right component was difficult because you basically had to guess where they were located(since the pile of components wasn't very accurate to where the components actually were) and it got kind of finicky.

Plantera 2 Golden Acorn is the sequel to 2016's hit farming-style clicker, Plantera. But is the sequel as good as the original? Absolutely. I had dubbed the first iteration, Carpel Tunnel Simulator and part 2 is no different. It adds a few new elements like the addition of the grand tree with said golden acorns, but it's the same cozy clicker game, that in my opinion sh!!ts on Cookie Clicker cause Plantera is just a lot cuter.

Perfect for just turning your brain off to, with all the whimsy and clicking & for the low price of 4.99 USD- I cant recommend this game enough to everyone.

I will say this though, after playing both Plantera games, The Golden Acorn feels a lot shorter. Cause after about 3 1/2 hours I 100% it. While part 1 took me about 13 hours. Still I'm having fun.",1.0

543,136604880.0,1919720,"It's good. Not Vampire Survivors good, but good.

In all seriousness, the game is good. There's nothing visually fancy, but if you're looking for something similar to VS this should give you what you want. There's 12 weapons, 5 characters, 3 stages, and some permanent upgrades. No fancy passive abilities or weapon merges (that I've seen).

Just don't be a silly goose like I was. When you select the mission you're doing for a map, you can select all 5 difficulties, which I thought would unlock the prior goals as I completed them. I was wrong. For example, to unlock level 5 blacksmith upgrades, you need only survive 90 seconds and then kill 400 enemies. I've done this twice, but never got level 5 upgrades because I died before surviving 500 seconds following the 400 enemies. So I 'completed' the goal but died, nulling the goal. Thus, if I'd only selected the first and second missions, I would already have upgraded my weapons (some of them at least) to level five. Well, you live and learn I suppose.

Many references to Chapter One which makes me glad that its fully canonical now in the saga and a direct continuation of young Sherlock growing into the famed detective. I wish theyd elaborated more of John and Sherlock's friendship but there were its wholesome moments throughout the game.

If you get stomped because of the incredible bad matchmaking you can surrender but most new players dont do that so you are stuck in a 10-15 minute game where you cant win and get banned from the game mode.

You have a few game modes but only anihilation is resonable for a new player, the rest are counter strike based modes.

Core gameplay loop revolves around physics interactions (not just the grappling hook) and it allows for some really fun movement tech once you get the hang of it. Bosses have been decent on challenge (around 1-3 runs for me per boss so far), but I think it'll very much depend on how good you get at understanding movement in the game. There's currently limited progression in the form of weapon upgrades, but given that you have to go out of your way to get the upgrade mats, it feels more like a case of ""the good get better rewards"".

I think the skill ceiling for this game is high, and the game does a good job of steadily encouraging you to improve the way you think about the space around you as well as your level of execution.

However, this game can also be very fun once you get the fundamentals down. Don't expect to win on your first several attempts, and spend time learning what everything does. There are several ways to scale and keep up with the difficult enemies this game throws at you, and swapping the places of your units on the field every turn to prevent the most damage is not only necessary, but adds another layer of strategy to the game.

There is also an amazing twist once you beat the final boss the first time, but I wont spoil that here.

You don't necessarily know exactly what you're going to encounter, but for the most part the enemies are very similar in each zone, and y. The art is cute and the musical composition is great (although several hours of hearing the same music will get old.) I do also appreciate how the mechanics are well-explained (if you right-click on cards) and enemy actions are always (with the one exception of [spoiler]Aimless[/spoiler] as well as [spoiler]enemies who explicitly have ""apply X to random enemy"" modifiers[/spoiler]) predictable. Same goes for your own turns.

The comments about balancing are somewhat unreasonable - this game hasn't been out even a day, much less had time for people to develop proper strategies for this. I had some exposure to the game from watching a streamer play it prior to launch, and you definitely can develop a strategy to go forward, even if it's not 100% successful. Yes, it's hard, and you die a lot, and there's RNG (like any roguelike), but it is one of those games that requires time spent to unlock more and get used to the mechanics to make your runs more successful. The RNG is primarily constrained to what cards/charms you get, as with most any deckbuilder.

To the devs: there [i]may[/i] be opportunities to change the balancing in the future, but please wait a bit and see what community forms around this game first before completely nerfing it.

587,136611627.0,1527950,"Overall this is a fun game.  I always enjoyed RPG like settings with larger groups, and this game certainly lets you do that.  It's not overly heavy on the RPG side though, pretty thin for story and dialogue, but it's forte is turn based combat.  

PROs
- Great map interaction, full of little Easter eggs to find
- Fun game-like interactions with picking locks, solving puzzles, using skills, finding hidden objects by searching the screen with cursor etc...
- Large groups!
- Can recruit animals

CONs
- Hard to get going in the early levels, as your small party takes a beating and needs repairs and healing often; gets easier with more members as the overall damage gets spread out between everyone
- Combat gets tedious toward the end, and gets very lopsided with your band gets larger
- Each map zone has a different back story quest to solve, but over all they're identical in nature.  Main quest, side missions from tavern contacts, and random missions to stumble upon.
- Traveling the map is a chore with the length of day and having to rest... seems like you can't travel more than a minute before you have to rest again.  Really needs to be addressed as it's a big detractor from just trying to get around the map and enjoy the game
- Very simple combat system... armor is extra hp, and all damage types translate to hp damage.  There's no chance of missing/dodging an attack during melee, so you area always getting hit every time.  Each side trades turns until one side eventually has more people left
- Tedious having to constantly pay and feed your party, but camp site structures help reduce that headache
- Not a big mix of enemies
- You can buy pack ""ponies"" for hauling more gear, but can't ride horses to make traveling faster?!
- lack of in game quest guide tips, had to use youtube videos at times to figure out what was going on in some quests

I played this game on the fixed level option, so each zone had a set level range.  The starter zone was challenging to get going.  The second zone was fair, but after completing it I out leveled the third zone to the SW and quickly ran through that quest and all missions in a single round of combat every time (think I was lvl 5-6 and the enemy was level 3 or so.  By the time I got the the last zone in the east, I had already started to collect bears for fun, and ended up with 12 or so bears as they're more common on the harder zones (had wolves too but let them go as the bears racked up), and 14 other guys.  It ended up silly as the bears are absolute tanks with 1000+ hp, and can hit for 70+ damage and take up a lot of map space squares to provide nice meat shields for the rest of my party.  I could have just dumped all my human members except for a couple and a beast master, and just played the bears.  The good thing with having animals is you only need to feed them, not pay them, and you don't have to fully feed your group as the other camp bonuses make up for losing happiness due to lack of food.",1.0

611,136607148.0,1811990,"If you like roguelike deckbuilders you will like this game. 

People seem to dislike the difficulty but I think it's in a good spot. Unlike other deckbuilders your main heros hp does not carry over between battles, this means that fights rarely whittle your resources slightly so that you would die three fights from now at the boss. Instead there are less individual fights in a run, but you will regularly go from full strength to dead in a single fight. One or two misplays can kill you if you're not paying attention because every fight needs to be potentially lethal by design. Personally I like it, as beating the fights while killing all the 'treasure goblins' is fun in the early game. While beating the back half requires good deck construction and execution. 

The things that set this apart from other games I've played is the style polish and charm. The bells jingle, the characters move when you drag the cards around. The shopkeeps and town are adorable.  The art is very cohesive and gives the world a sense of whimsy. It puts a smile on my face every time I meet a new npc. Also the game is just fun.

613,136606900.0,1811990,I really enjoy the game and played 3h in the raw. It is taking the best of Slay the Spire but also from Rogue Legacy with our village to build up bringing further cards to build up your deck. However the main issue and I’ve seen other sharing this concern is the game is yet to be well balanced. Any deck building game you’re playing will make a you a hard time the first rounds but once you understand the enemies and your deck then you should never lose the first fights. But here you can because it will depends on what you get when you start. And because you got only one support for the first battle you can get overwhelmed very easily. I went through the third world (two boss fight won) and then I play again and loose again the first battle. So definitely some work to do but the ground is solid and this will be a must have once the balance has been fixed. Or maybe it will never be as this is something that can happen in Rogue Legacy too. Let’s see but I still recommend it. Great game overall.,1.0

616,136606158.0,1811990,"The art style is beautiful, meta progression is implemented in a fun and engaging way that somewhat encourages the player to branch out and try some new stuff ocasionally, the HUD elements are simple and to the point, the soundtrack and visual effects are excellent and although it appears somewhat complex, learning the basics to the combat flow was a breeze. This game has tons of elements that really make it stand out above the crowd, and it does a lot of things in a fresh manner that make it seem a rather promising title, if the proper care is put into it.

Despite all this, at around 20 runs and 3 hours in, it has become clear that the balancing is abysmal. On my first few runs I just brushed it off to being new at the game, but after dying to the first battle in the campaign the first couple of times I figured something was way off, and it seems like this is a common issue to those that have already played the game. Even 
some positive reviews list it as an unbalanced mess

Enemies are numerous and extremely punishing. I enjoy having certain ""factions"" of foes, each possessing varying abilities and passives. You have enemies that focus on shielding themselves, enemies that use their hp as attack value and enemies that focus on debuffing. That being said, each enemy type requires you to have a certain ""answer"" to their skillset, which becomes a frustrating element of the game when you have such limited options to expand your deck and absolutely no way of knowing which enemies you'll end up facing. Got a build that focuses on attacking?  Too bad, for the next fight you'll be pitted against thorned enemies. Oh well, better luck next time. Having fights test the player's deck in different aspects is a great way of keeping the gameplay fresh but this is a ludicrous way of doing so. 

Let's also talk about the wave system in battles. The counter ticks down every turn to punish the player for stalling out fights which is a cool way of keeping combat fluid and engaging, but defeating enemies before the timer runs out just causes instant reinforcements anyway. With that in mind, the player's choice is between 1. Dragging out combat in an attempt to scale your team to face the army of threats aproaching and 2. Rushing the enemies to try and defeat most of them before you get overwhelmed. Not exactly a good way to reward quickly disposing of enemies since you get fucked over for doing so anyway.

Heroes being randomized was something that caught my eye when watching people playing the demo. After playing for a while, though, I wish they had stuck to a more basic approach instead of this messy implementation. Most heroes are delightfully useless, and serve more as a burden than anything else, since you're obligated to put them on the board. If you get unlucky enough with your draw, you might end up just dying outright to the first battle, before you even get a chance to modify your deck, which, albeit hilarious, is pretty bad from a balancing perspective.

The timer on actions was also a fun mechanic to mess around with and explore when I was starting out. However, this means action economy is terribly unbalanced (just as many, many other aspects of this game's combat). The mana system used in most modern deckbuilders triumphs greatly over Wildfrost's take, here, when it becomes painstakingly difficult to keep up with enemies when the players' actions are both costly and widely uninpactful. 

It seems wildfrost is trying to place itself as a challenging game, which I enjoy greatly, but there's also this feeling that the game is afraid of giving the player any agency. You have no reroll options, no chance to pass up a companion or an item (that I encountered in my short time playing) that'll bloat your deck or be left to gather dust in the reserve, and it makes me scratch my head and ask: ""why?""

Companions themselves (and heroes, for that matter) are largely designed to be brittle and fragile, as to make positioning and delaying enemy actions (or killing them outright before they even get a chance to act) important, but at the same time, the game makes them widely meek compared to enemies. You have heroes with whopping 7 cooldown triggers that dont even deal direct damage. You have pets, which are unique to the start of the game, occupying a slot that could be used for a companion later, which actively encourage you to trash them when you get better units.

 Most synergies that don't work instantly with your starter hero will be disappointing until more companions and items are in your deck (if you even survive to that point) that fit that particular role, and you're not even guaranteed to get any. Add this to the fact that you have a measly 2 slots for companions before you have to replace some, and also that you're not even guaranteed heroes that'll sinergize with anything and things will start to look bleak before you even start a run.

I could go on and on. Wildfrost's current state in balancing is apalling. I would ask for a refund if I could. I encourage anyone reading this to either skip completely or wait for a heavy discount. Of course, I'll edit this if things change, but even if I'm being optimistic, there's a lot, and I mean [b] a lot [/b], of work to be put in this game before I'd recommend it.

617,136607691.0,1811990,"Superb graphical and musical design and (imho) great gameplay. 
Game autosaves after every turn, so you physically can't save scum battles like in Slay the Spire for example. And you usually get severely punished for missplays. 
Sometimes a turn has too much going on and it's hard to plan your next move and easy to make a mistake, but when (if) you figure it out, it really makes you feel smart. 
Haven't noticed any ""unfair RNG"" that some reviewers talk about, skill issue in my opinion ;). 
Haven't been able to progress too far yet, so no comments on replayability.

619,136606733.0,1527950,"Oh, fellow gamer, let me regale you with my thoughts on the fantastic Wartales game! It's a game that's similar to Battle Brothers, but with its own unique mechanics and graphics. While the genre is the same, the game feels refreshingly different and new.

What I particularly love about Wartales is its challenging gameplay. Although I will admit that it's slightly easier than Battle Brothers at the moment, the developer seems to be working on making the game even tougher, and that's something I'm eagerly anticipating! After all, what's a game without a good challenge, am I right?

I have nothing but praise for the game's management and fighting aspects. The game has a good balance between these two elements, and it's what makes it so addictive and enjoyable to play. I'm absolutely hooked, and I can't get enough of it!

As a hardcore gamer, I'm not easily impressed, but Wartales has truly won me over. I would happily give it a 9/10 rating, and I would definitely buy it again without hesitation.

625,136606912.0,2354600,"Alright, so here it goes...I'll start with a simple Pros and Cons list which is usually a quick and easy way to gauge if you wanna play this game or not. 

Pros:
- Great art style with an amazing color palette and ""bloom"" or glowing effects from items and ambient set pieces
- Music is fun and not subjectively not annoying
- Character movement is smooth and effortless
- Very easy to earn tons of coins which in turn helps level up your character fairly quickly
- Combat is varied but in an old school fun kind of ""megaman needs to dodge energy balls"" kind of way, if that makes any sense
- Variety of enemies keeps you on your feet which can be exciting
- Power-Up's make you feel actually powerful but not OP which is a good balance
- UI is easy to navigate, includes plenty of language and customization options which is much appreciated

Cons:
- None of the purchasable powerups have explanations which would be nice before spending coins on them
- Certain powerups have a painfully long cooldown (I'm looking at you Snickerdoodle)
- The difficulty level is a bit rough too early in the game, getting to the 4th or 5th instance can be a bit of a challenge and should be a tad bit easier (level 1 and 2 should be a breeze for those possibly unfamiliar with these types of games)
- More lore would be nice even if the player hasn't seen the movie but this is just me nitpicking lol

Look, its an Early Access game for like what...5 bucks or something? Buy the damn thing and have some fun. It clearly needs some work but that's almost too harsh of a term, it needs good buff and polish job. IMO all the hard work was already done and it shows. This is basically a better looking version of Vampire Survivors with a bit less content is all. The game clearly doesn't take it self seriously and I love that, I'm here to have fun and accomplish something, this game lets you feel like you're doing that without trying to convince you that you're a vampire! 

Go have fun!

630,136606623.0,1527950,"I've been with this game for about a year, so into early access but not super far back, and seeing this game just get progressively better every new patch is great.

Pros:
-Combat is super fun. It can be really challenging at times, but not impossible to the point where it feels like you're climbing up a mountain. There's a lot of strategy, especially on the expert difficulty (which you should play on), and the enemy variety, as well as environmental factors and many other small things, makes it so that every skirmish is different. Each class have subclasses which amounts to a huge variety of combos you can run. You can have really dope synergies in your troop.
-Campaign mechanics, aka when you're walking around with your troop, picking up quests, feeding them, etc, is very satisfying. It's not super micromanagement heavy, but you still need to pay attention to your ressources, your troop's happiness, your relationships, food and gold so your playthrough doesn't go haywire.
-Graphics are good and very consistent. The style of the game is nice to look at and each area has something new to look at. most areas will look different, combat animations are very crisp and have a lot of girth and power behind them, and extra things like weather look good to.
-The devs are super proactive and responsible. They constantly listen to player feedback and they're on top of patching and updating the game. Major respect for that.

Cons:
-The game doesn't really have a main story. If you want a story driven game, this ain't it, because this is one of those 'make your own story' games. The lack of a main narrative doesn't really upset me personally, but not having characters or a plot really takes away from choices you have to make throughout your playthroughs. It's not that big of a downfall.
-Difficulty scaling in this game can be a little weird at times. For the most part, I think the difficulty is pretty reasonable (it also depends on the difficulty your playing on). However, it's very easy to get absolutely dumpstered early on by enemies that you really shouldn't run in to. Even in the mid and late parts of the game, some fights like arena challenges are pretty unfair at times, sometimes warranting the acquirement of some legendary weapons or serious levelling up to stand a chance.
-It's not as big of a problem as it used to be, but foraging for resources on the campaign map is still a little janky at times. Sometimes resources spawn outside the map or in impossible to reach places, and your troop's movement is very sensitive. It can be really annoying at times when you're trying to go up a hill but there's a small bit of impassible terrain in your way and your troops completely ignores its move order. The devs are aware of this jankiness however and i'm certain this will be addressed more in the future.
-Relationships in your troop happen passively overtime, whether your guys are saving each other's asses, drinking booze together by the fire and joking, or doing the opposite and cursing each other out, fighting one another, etc. It's cool, but it really doesn't change much in the game. You get small bonuses if 'friends' are next to each other, but the damage bonuses are very small and aren't super noticeable. From the start of my longest playthrough to the end of it where my relationships started at 0 until I had a troop of 23 guys who all loved each other, I could hardly tell if relationships had done anything. Hopefully they're changed to be more prevalent and actually affect the troop more seriously like in Darkest Dungeon 2.

These cons are very minor and in a few months time, I bet they will have been addressed by the devs already, so take them with a grain of salt. The fact I can only think of these minor negatives about Wartales says a lot about how fun this game is. Definitely worth the purchase, even at its full price, and if you see it on sale, 100% grab it if you're even slightly interested.

It's not like the game is ""too hard"" as others have claimed the negative reviews are about, it's just nothing like any other deckbuilder i've ever played. In a bad way.

669,136613378.0,1811990,"I see a lot of complaints that this game is too hard or is not balanced properly.  This made me hesitant to buy the game at first, but I got it anyway and I'm glad I did.  I disagree with the complaints.  People who think this game is too hard have probably never gotten an Ascension 20 heart kill in Slay the Spire.

I only have about 4 hours in the game so far.  Maybe it will scale up in difficulty as I progress, like Slay the Spire did.  I have finished 2 runs and the game has been quite fun already.  I didn't find it to be too difficult; in fact, on my first blind play-through, I reached what was probably the final boss.  I lost to him because I didn't understand his mechanics, but I think I understand them now and that defeating him should be quite doable.  I think I could have won on my 2nd play-through, but I was playing at 2 AM and due to tiredness left my leader in front of the boss's 50 damage attack when I had plenty of ways to prevent that from happening.  I think I definitely would have won otherwise.  Either way, not bad for a 2nd play-through.  

All that is to say, I don't think this game is too hard at all, and I think it has a lot of interesting synergies that I am eager to explore.  If you have ever gotten an Ascension 20 heart kill in Slay the Spire, then ignore all of the negative reviews complaining about difficulty and balance.  The same can be said if you've ever gotten a max covenant win in Monster Train.  

This game has pleasant art and sound design.  The way you play cards in rows is somewhat reminiscent of Monster Train, but there are other aspects which make the game play feel quite unique, like only playing 1 card per turn (mostly, unless you have a specific buff on a card).  

I'm glad I bought the game.  I have played enough Slay the Spire (about 500 hours) and Monster Train (about 200 hours) that I have been burnt out on both of them several times.  This game scratches the itch for a rogue like deck builder and is unique enough to feel fresh and exciting for me.",1.0

674,136614239.0,1893370,"Journalistic integrity disclosure: I am Rumbletron's cousin and his grandma is paying me to mow her lawn.

This is a very short early access release. First episode or not, it's more of a decent-sized demo than anything. I'd say it's worth keeping an eye on, but you may want to hold off for a little while unless you really, really want this to support this right off the bat.
What Ghostware: Arena of the Dead is not is a traditional single-player FPS. As it stands, it's more like a series of bot matches with the odd campaign level or mid-level event here and there, and after you clear an arena, you revisit it and look for secrets. Some of these secrets directly give you upgrades, but most give you links to fictional websites you visit through your in-game browser, and it's through these that much of the story is told.
This is what distinguishes Ghostware most right now, and in my opinion it should lean even more into this than it does at the moment. When it does, it has this atmosphere and sense of mystery and discovery that the game's more traditional cutscenes and dialogue lack. It's teetering on this strange line between just okay and potentially really, really distinct and memorable. This is a game that needs to go all the way, do weird stuff, and take risks if it wants to succeed. Break the ""game,"" throw unfinished level geometry and out of bounds areas at the player, feed him a bunch of links that may or may not have much to do with the plot, really, just spitball a bunch of weird shit and focus more on that than polish and traditional game narrative.

To conclude this half-asleep review, I say to the devs,

681,136614543.0,1811990,"Game needs to be expanded upon. The entire campaign is somewhere around 10 battles that are extremely intense. Some of them include deck checks that are complete bs if you don't know they're coming. It's one of those games where you spend the entire time thinking, ""How do I lose?"" instead of ""how do I win?""

Some events like the muncher (thins your deck) and charms (too easy to get something useless for your deck) sound good but end up being noob traps because having a follower synergy is way more important. Now those events wouldn't be useless if the campaign was longer and you actually had some time to refine your deck, but you don't. Likewise, the shortness of the campaign also makes certain synergies not viable because you probably won't have time to put it together.

There's a lot of reviews already claiming this game to be too hard or have difficulty spikes. I don't mind when a game is challenging, if anything i prefer it, it keeps things interesting and engaging. 

This game however does not feel challenging, it feels unfair. I rarely (if ever) feel I could have made different choices to have changed the outcome upon defeat leaving me with little to nothing to learn from. The way the enemies are balanced, their abilities and base stats, feels as though they expect you to have a powerful build put together by the time you get them but provides so few ways to manipulate your deck building to create a deck with enough synergy. Even in the few times I DO get solid deck together getting through an encounter is sketchy at best.

There's a lot of potential here though. Some adjustments to the games balance whether it be providing more deck manipulation, weighted synergy RNG, or reduced enemy numbers could very easily bring the game into a great spot and change this review.

- the innovative counter system.
- the replayability added by the randomly generated heroes
- the charm upgrade system

The game overall is extremely polished. The combat is unique to the genre with dynamic positioning options, card selections and manipulation, and tons of emergent gameplay with the mechanics interactions. Lots of decision-making and thought involved in your play patterns. Really creative ways to pilot your units and give them synergy.

I will echo what other reviewers mentioned though, which is that the runthroughs can feel really feast or famine. There are some issues:
- Enemies that force 'Aimless' onto your allies or have Aimless themselves feel very unfair, forcing your units to attack into thorns or other detrimental effects or to possibly get sniped by enemies. I think like 50% of my runs ended to Aimless RNG.
- No option to decline card additions or hero additions.
- Starting heroes can be very very bad with not many ways to salvage them.
- No ways to mitigate bad RNG--not enough removal options. Maybe put discovered charms in the shop at a higher cost (Slay the Spire does this with relics and its a nice touch). There are a lot of charms that feel completely useless.
- Limited path branching means not as much agency with map nodes--would like to see that expanded to have more choices.

714,136616532.0,1811990,"Summary of the negative reviews: ""Waah the hard card game is too difficult >:("". To address the negative reviews seriously. They mostly complain about game balance, but the game offers a lot of powerful mechanics to the player, and challenges presented feel very reasonable, usually only requiring a shift in strategy to address. Think Slay the Spire, that game is brutally difficult and is beloved for it, this game is in the exact same vein. Yes it's hard, but it offers so many ways for the player to succeed. Clear example is the companion Yuki, you can easily buff him to have more than 30 attack (heck much more in my experience) simply by spamming frost, this is enough to kill most bosses in one hit. He's too squishy for a particular boss? Give him shields. Low on health? Recall him, the attack buff stays for the whole combat. Anyways my actual review is below.

My experience playing this has been absolutely great. First of all I love to see a fully complete game being released, it's surprisingly uncommon these days. Past that the game oozes charm and is extremely fun to boot. I'll lay out some pros and cons, but generally if you like card roguelikes and the art you'll love this one.

Pros
- Absolutely charming art
- Fun characters
- Unique and interesting card roguelike format
- Card effects feel varied and unique

Cons
- Random leader selection is a fun idea but leaders often feel less powerful and unique as the companion cards",1.0

For positives the the visuals/music are amazing, and I love the character designs. Everything is just so bright and color, definitely stands out compared to the likes of Monster Train and Slay the Spire. Though in a game like this I feel gameplay is the most important part, and this game stumbles rather hard on that front. You either get an amazing combo within the first 1-2 areas or you die. It ramps up far to quickly most of the time, to the point where most strategies don't work because you can't wait to get the cards you need. Either the card works now or you die, with rarely any inbetween. Hell you can get an amazing combo and still die thanks to the enemies just hard countering your strategy. Have fun with that barrage build when the enemies have nothing but teeth. There are plenty of interesting ideas don't get me wrong, but there really needs to be some work with this.

 However, I could not get past the puzzle aspect and immediately wanted to skip it after the first play through. Not that it was hard, but rather that it became a game of connect the dots more than a puzzle card game. It became rather tedious and frustrating, and as the story got closer to the finish the puzzles got longer instead of harder.

 To tell the truth I never even learn how the puzzles worked until the very end of my second play though more out of curiosity then need.  It was faster to just connect the dots so to speak then try and figure out the puzzle.

It is a little weird, to not have disc battles or lightcycle races in a Tron game - but this isn't what this game is trying to be. The description, screenshots and trailers make it pretty clear what it is and I think the price tag is pretty fair in that regard.

As far as MTX go you can buy operators, skins (skins give bonus exp) and a premium sub that gives more exp/credits.

I'm a big fan of the Tron IP and it's such a shame that so little is done with it in terms of games. So when i heard they were making a VN detective game i was so excited as its a part of the universe we don't see much if at all and i think this really delivers that experience 

Set in a separate area from the movies lets this stand on its own, even though we got a short time with these characters we still learn alot about this world and how it has and is still evolving and changing, the talk of past wars, enemies and friends, new factions and ideologies. I want to talk more and spend more time here.

The game is short and i can see people getting annoyed with the puzzle gameplay but i found it a nice change of pace.

I wouldn't pay too much attention to the players screeching because they haven't won a run yet, seeing this complaint a lot recently on more difficult roguelikes.  Dudes with 2 hours in a game expecting to be cruising through everything is laughable.  I personally get excited when a deckbuilder makes me sweat.

777,136621515.0,1811990,"I've followed the game since its first anouncement on the Nintendo Direct a year ago. I've played demo for hours and hours and it's a blast to finally touch the real thing.

The gameplay is quite original. I spent a lot of time on Slay the Spire, which is also a Deckbuilder/Roguelike, but it has a completely difference turn system which is very fresh. Each action has a great impact on the game, and you need to think wisely about if using that card is worth a turn, or not.

Graphics and musics are just perfect. I'm a sucker for this art style.

I see a lot of people posting negative reviews because of balancing problems. I can agree that some mechanics are clearly more powerful than others, but that's also the fun of it, discovering what works or not. I'd like to see corrections and new mechanics added in the future, but for the time being, I think it does the work well enough. My only real critic would be that we have too little control over the contruction of our deck. More ways to banish a card or reroll a treasure would certainly be a nice addition.

It is quite a difficult game, that's for sure. I don't see it as a negative though, quite the opposite. Just take that into consideration if you're not a big fan of struggle.

778,136621393.0,1811990,"I have to echo many of the sentiments of those who have had issues with this game. I want to love Wildfrost, the graphics and presentation are just utterly amazing. The charm that this game imparts is something that keeps drawing me back to play another run, but the immense number of balance issues prevent me from trying this game any further. This is sad given that I absolutely love this genre, and would've loved another game to sink more time into, but in its current form, I cannot recommend it.

Balance issues are as follows:

1. Heroes are generally pretty bad: The heroes that you get to select at the beginning are, more often than not, underwhelming and completely eclipsed by the enemies you'll face, both in terms of health and damage output. This makes the early game significantly more difficult as I found that I was always leaning towards the tougher heroes and neglecting the ones with special abilities, simply to ensure that I had enough output to keep up with the games difficulty ramp.

2. Most companions, charms and treasures are either bad, or just actively make your deck worse: Building a deck around some kind of strategy becomes either rare, or nearly impossible when the choices of companions you're presented with are basically unplayable, or don't meld well with your existing deck. The inability to 'skip' a pick, means you're forced to actively add cards to your deck that make an already bad deck, worse. The charms are all over the place, and the fact that you only get a single charm to pick from when you find them in the dispensers means that quite often you get less out of the route you take then you would otherwise need to keep up. Many of the charms are just straight up bad. I only once in all my runs managed to put some kind of coherent strategy together, and even then it wasn't enough to beat the run.

3. Enemies swarm you: It didn't take long me to realise that this games balance has some serious issues, particularly when waves of enemies keep spawning at a rate far greater than your ability to dispose of them. Given that many enemies can act faster, have more health, and even hit harder than anyone on your team, it makes the swarming even worse. Most of my runs ended because I simply couldn't keep up with the sheer number of enemies that were appearing on the screen. When the mini-boss of each stage appears, if you haven't sufficiently dealt with prior enemies, it can make the game unplayable in terms of difficulty.

I enjoy a challenging game, and don't mind taking the time to learn how to play these better in order to overcome the difficulty, but Wildfrost's balance makes any attempt to trying to do that seemingly pointless. Beating this game seems to come down more to RNG with card choices, and charms then it does with the actual skill of the player. Either you lucked out on an extremely good deck, or your run is just dead.

For the above reasons (and many others that have been mentioned in other reviews), I cannot recommend Wildfrost.",0.0

In 4 hours I played 4 runs, won 2 of them, and died once to the final boss and once midway through. Balancing seems fine. Or maybe I am just lucky :P

Game is awesome. The pixelated style is a common choice for these roguelite games, but the combination of the music, the animations, and the sometimes goofy moments makes me wonder what the movie will be like. Which...is probably what the developers want, but I have to say, they do it well. So whatever gripes I may have being advertised to by a videogame are all unimportant since it worked >:)

Some visual/gameplay issues I noticed. Hitboxes are not very defined. I can sometimes get right into an enemy's face without getting hit, and the others it feels like I got suckerpunched from nowhere. And that is just the melee enemies. The enemy bullets are hard to keep track of. I had a buddy watch me from the side and with all the shimmying about I was doing to hit the enemies, I neglected the bullets that were apparently obvious. Now, that might be my ADHD at play, but I was definitely getting better about avoiding most of the onslaught of projectiles. Another issue is the controls. Not having a cursor from your mouse made things a little wonky in the menu screen. At first, the game crashed on exit, but it seems that was fixed pretty quickly. Also, don't expect to win...for some time. Or maybe I am just bad at the game (:

Ideas for the future? I am not going to tell the developers how to play the game, but some things I had questions on are how hard it is to understand anything. For example, the Victims you are to save or kill...I think an achievement is related to this option, but I can't determine how to go about it. I both saved and killed the Cheerleader in the first level with Renfield, but there was no obvious difference in result, save for time remaining upon reaching the boss room and the amount of money that was rewarded. Is money going to be more important in a future update? Also, the shop was a little surprising. It took me a bit to realize there were other tabs lol. Also also, the coffin was something I wasn't sure what it did until I realized I had to buy it multiple times. I had thought its effect was an upgrade I got in a run.

All-in-all, the game is hectic, visually stimulating, probably a good game to watch for streamers, and if this is just the beginning, then I am looking forward to what the developers bring in the future.

I will keep playing just to see if beating the levels in both Feed and Save options for both playable characters will do something. Then I will play to see if there are good synergies.

Sometimes at the end of a battle you try to click continue and it'll sit there for 5-6 minutes before giving you the reward and allowing you to continue. Sometimes it just locks up entirely and you gotta reload before the battle and replay the whole thing. Hope you saved because the auto save overwrites itself. On top of all that it encrypts all the values to prevent people from cheating in a single player game. Annoying and dumb design decision. Let people cheat in single player games if they want. 

Wait a few weeks/months for the bugs to be fixed. Absolutely don't buy if you use a multi-monitor setup. It's an exercise in frustration using 3 monitors. Given how often it crashes it absolutely needs multiple autosaves and shouldn't just overwrite the exiting one into state where it crashes when you click continue at the end of a battle. Also at least one farm in the starting zone doesn't have an exit.... Hope you enjoy replaying the last autosaved battle.",0.0

As little Ellie embarks on her Easter egg hunt adventure, the game masterfully blends whimsy and terror, immersing players in a dark and twisted world beneath the surface. The graphics and sound design evoke a haunting atmosphere, with eerie music and unsettling visuals that keep you on the edge of your seat.

Dye The Bunny's narrative is both chilling and captivating, making it difficult to look away even when you're on the verge of screaming. The game's developers have taken a creative risk by combining the innocence of childhood with the darkness of horror, and the result is a unique experience that will leave a lasting impression on players.

Overall, Dye The Bunny is a must-play for horror enthusiasts and those seeking a fresh twist on a classic holiday celebration.

Example: Third fight in the run. I have been able to pick TWO additional cards from six options so far this run:

Got a guy that gives teeth (damage when hit) to all his teammates but he's sat at the second row (behind someone else I have to kill first to hurt him). My range cards do two damage and has 14 health. 

I can't fight the enemies in front of him as they have teeth that hurt me, and I can't hurt him as I don't have a yank or long range damage card as none have been offered to me. I just lose.

In most games, of this kind, such as Slay the Spire, you get like 30 choices of cards to add to the deck, events to get things that change your playstyle etc. over the course of a run. That gives you the ability to minimise the effect of RNG, so you can strategise and make the most of a bad situation if it comes to that.

This game gives you about 9. This means the enemies ramp up quickly and so the only successful runs will be the ones where you get extremely lucky. There's no chance to mitigate bad RNG. You just don't get the opportunity. You have to hope every time you get a card or charm that it's the exact one you need.

>>>>>>> 22ca15cc8f142b6bee681ff83a1a3d81d50a9551

Just gonna say first of all this game is fun gameplay is actually really good but I decided to calculate how long it would take to collect all operators that are available for purchase through just the daily challenges as I have yet to unlock the weekly challenges or any of that so will update this accordingly when I get to that point. And as a addition this is without unlocking any operator upgrades or skills as the time would heavily differ

Credits from daily objectives:
No Premium = 27,050
Premium = 38,850

To get all operators for a class is:
100,000 x 3 = 300,000 credits
150,000 x 5 = 750,000 credits
200,000 x 6 = 1,200,000 credits
All together = 2,250,000 credits
(This isn't counting the 4 operators that could only be obtained through a previous battle pass)

So to get all operators for a class as both a non premium and premium player (Remember this game has 4 different classes)
Non Premium - 2,250,000/27,050 = Approx. 84 days of daily challenges
Premium - 2,250,000/38,850 = Approx. 58 days of daily challenges

If you wanted to buy these with coins (the premium currency) operators in this game cost either 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 coins depending on credit cost of operator (shown above)

Prices for coins:
2,250 coins = $11.99
5,000 coins = $23.99

I get it as a free to play developer you need to be making money but if you don't really give a decent incentive and give people the opportunity to unlock stuff in your game within a somewhat timely manner then this might knock a lot of people from wanting to play a game

Like I mentioned at the start the gameplay of this is really fun has a nice ghost recon feel to it and this game could really be something good but please look into what people get with their time

After 100+ hours in FX on Epic and 100+ hours in FX3 on a lot of the same tables, the new FX is my go-to platform and the one I see myself playing long into the future.  

The difference is all in the physics.  There's some visual upgrades for sure - which are actually a mixed bag at the moment, because while the game looks great, it's wildly unoptimized - but what's important in pinball is how it /feels/, and FX feels fantastic.  To compare the two, FX3 is fun and springy, easy and arcadey, while FX, to me, feels like far more like playing real pinball.  It's more challenging and realistic, more unpredictable, faster and less forgiving.  The default competitive mode is ""Classic"", which allows you to play for scores and excludes the powerups that were a necessity in the default mode of FX3 if you wanted to top the leaderboards.  If you're still after the powerups, you can find them in ""Arcade"" mode, but ""Classic"" feels great in my hands, and if you want a challenge even above that, there's ""Pro"" mode on each of the Williams tables with a steeper playfield and tougher rules.  

This game is imperfect, and a work in progress (please add proper Ultrawide support!), but it doesn't deserve to be drowned out in negative reviews.  I'll update this with some more detailed thoughts, but if you're any sort of a pinball fan at all, ignore the hubbub and give FX a look.  You'll be glad you did.",1.0
836,136622979.0,2328760,"Having played many hours on Epic, I'm so happy to see this launch on Steam. The biggest draw to Pinball FX is the updated physics system coming from the prior entry, Pinball FX3. While much of this may feel minor at first, the ball behaves far more consistently across different tables and the challenge on the non simulator pinball tables (i.e, Zen Originals and franchise crossovers) is much faster and weighty. Graphically, it is a solid improvement if you have a capable PC. The ray-tracing is nice, although not mandatory. It is much improved over its early access performance, and I now get around 90FPS with max graphics settings at 1440p with ray-tracing enabled. Hey, it's just nice to see those reflections on the glossy board :-) 

The elephant in the room is the lack of DLC carryover to the new platform. While unfortunate, I believe this is a passion project geared towards enthusiasts. Recreating each table takes time, so does implementing ray-tracing, updating lighting, and ensuring all of the prior systems work with how the ball and flippers now behave; this is no small feat. Given the DLC packs which discount purchases of updated tables if you already own them on PFX3 (See the legacy bundles), I think it is fair. Zen have provided multiple ways to discount tables and assist long-term players in the transition to the new system. 

No, you don't *need* to update to Pinball FX if you are happy with Pinball FX3. Keep your purchases there and keep enjoying the game! Those tables are still great. However if you are an enthusiast, you will enjoy playing these tables with their updated physics along with the already hefty amount of new content. I have particularly enjoyed Wrath of the Elder Gods, Grimm Tales, World War Z and the new William's tables (Addams Family, finally!). 

Two thumbs up from me. Zen have really pulled through after their rocky launch on Epic and I'm excited to see how this platform develops for years to come. Between the Punishinly accurate Williams simulations, the video-gamey Zen Originals and numerous franchise crossovers, I believe Pinball FX has truly become THE hub for Pinball, no matter how you engage with the game.",1.0

840,131242928.0,2077590,"Feels like a frustration simulator.

Even though the point is obviously to survive the 20 waves, it still feels more of a pointless endeavor than other games within this genre. It may be because the enemies are all autopathing looking like they are in a MOBA going to a tower, but they are just doing large loops around the map I think, with no destination. 

There are good bits that, if changed quite a bit, may be fun in the future. But I think the majority of positive reviews currently posted are probably less than genuine. I would have returned it even for the $3, but I took my dog out for a walk and didn't see I left it on for 2.5 hours.",0.0
841,130907751.0,2077590,"I had high hopes for Sidestep Legends and I really wanted to like it because the concept is neat, but I feel like I keep going back to it and it just doesn't quite click for me. The player is offered a traditional bullet heaven control scheme, with WASD or gamepad stick usage and fixed camera, or one closer to MOBAs with the mouse doing all the heavy lifting. It's all about sidesteps, avoiding enemy attacks, traps and more, with a handful of enemy types roaming on predetermined paths as the mobs in a MOBA unless the player bothers them. Unlike the waves of Vampire Survivors clones, Sidestep Legends barely features any attack that can be used to damage opponents while moving, so players will be required to keep switching between moving and standing still, to dodge and to attack respectively. This is a fun take on the genre for sure, as it adds an extra layer of strategy and decision-making, on top of a higher skill ceiling.

The issue is that it doesn't really feel too rewarding. The enemies are not very varied, and they pose a challenge pretty much only because the player has to stop to fight them, with an initial attack range pre-upgrades that is quite laughable. The base attacks and speeds are also superlow, though upgrades make them a lot more satisfying eventually. The map has XP gems and coins spawn all across, with even treasure chests and challenges filling in the blanks, but often these happen far away from enemies who, remember, follow predetermined paths. The game actively pushes you away from the action a lot of the time, with traps like gas waves, fire areas and hooks pulling the player back for extra challenge. This is the game's incentive to have the player moving... but again, you are supposed to stop to attack, which means that most of the time you will not be attacking, as it doesn't take long before you are looking at a couple dozen enemies and traps are spawning everywhere. 

Couple all this with fairly unimpressive 3D visuals and a skill tree that's packed with tons of expensive yet minor upgrades, and I just can't say that I truly enjoy or want to recommend this game yet. Even when the upgrades become more satisfying, some higher level skills and characters are unlocked and you're battling against a giant boss, at its core Sidestep Legends feels like you're fighting against the game's design trying to slow your every move and attack more so than the hundreds of identical minions you encounter in a run. A good bullet heaven and a good MOBA both make you feel swift and powerful, and unfortunately that feeling is too rare here for me to recommend the game as of now. I plan to revisit it in the future because it's still in Early Access and I believe the concept can achieve a lot more with some balancing and design tweaks.

The Gameplay feels good: the TTK is quite quick but not too quick and the weapons feel great and powerful.
The movement has a slight learning curve too it (not negative) since you can turn in all directions in anyway which can make you loose orientation, but you do get used to it.


Overall i think this game has great potential. With just some polishing, frequent updates and a steady playercount i can see this game become quite popular amongst FPS and space enjoyers.",1.0

861,136637729.0,2342030,"I'm really on-the-fence with this one. On one hand, I genuinely had fun for a number of hours so far playing this. On the other hand this is mobile-game levels of pay2win that makes even world of tanks look respectable.

So basically you have a clone (visually) to world of tanks, now you remove ALL of the armor/hit/bounce/pen mechanics. Replace it with two hitboxes per tank, and the tank is hit in Box A (The front/top/front 90% of the sides) that tank takes 50% of the damage done by the gun. If the round hits Box B (The rear and the back 20% of the sides) it takes 100% of the damage done by the gun.

That pretty much sums up the general gunplay, very arcade'y. The game does stir things up a bit with equipment which acts as tank abilities. (Some tanks only have access to certain ones.) Which can set things on fire, place landmines, repair, debuff enemy tanks, buff your tank, etc. And they can be used repeatedly with a long cooldown.

The actual gameplay mechanics make less sense. There are bases for each team, and they can be captured. But they serve no purpose currently, they don't win the match, they don't prevent enemy respawns, they don't get points, nada. Broken/missing mechanics basically. Also players can respawn into ANY tanks they have left after dying, so matches can go on for a LONG time with each player having like 5-12 tanks eventually, there is a time limit however.

Ok, so onto the bad. The game sells pay2win to some insane levels. decals/camo even give SUBSTANTIAL damage buffs. (like 10% each) There is also gold ammo, but since there is no armor pen/bounce system, it just straight up does +50% damage AND randomly disables any tank shot with it briefly. If you have it, and someone else doesn't, you automatically win ANY shootout, even if your in a light tanks and they are in a heavy tank. There is also pay2win equipment, pay2win premium tanks that are +30% stronger than the normal ones. The list is a mile long on the Pay2win.

98% of the enemy tanks are also bots currently. Very few players. The A.I. is pretty good though and acts like a only marginally mentally retarded player. They will also ALWAYS target you immediately if you shoot them, even if they are in a 9-way melee range shootout and you snipe at them from a mile away, they will immediately ignore everything else and fire at you. Making the A.I. effective at killing YOU, but not good at winning a match.",1.0
862,136637589.0,2318550,"A straightforward action game where you must eliminate enough enemies to advance to the next level. 

Despite the fact that the game is marketed as a shooter, melee scythe attacks end up being more effective because they hit with a broad swipe. Furthermore, the controls don't operate in a twin-shooter fashion, making it challenging to get the perfect shot. 

The main goal of most stages is to eliminate all enemies, but occasionally you also need to accomplish things like close portals that continually create enemies. Because you have to drag an extremely slow ball to the portal, these stages aren't very good. The fact that you must always stay close makes things worse; if you stray too far, it will stop following.

Progress can’t be lost. Dying just requires you to restart the current level and keep trying until you succeed. The following stage may be made even more challenging, though. Health is carried over to the next stage along with everything else you've acquired, such as ammo and souls that act as currency. 

The problem happens if you finish the stage with only a few health bars. Because health drops are rare, this means you will be stuck with that health the entire stage. It’s possible to turn a difficult stage into an chore that never becomes fun again.

863,136637957.0,2109430,Short and sweet. Good story and good vibes. Would recommend if you want two hours of Tron. Also always great to see a Black protagonist don't get too many of those.,1.0
864,136637757.0,2109430,"I'm not a big visual novel guy, so keep that in mind.

As a game? The story was engaging, I could suspend my disbelief enough to feel like I was the one making decisions, and the decisions feel meaningful. The puzzle mechanic wasn't stellar and felt like an  obstacle rather than a challenge, but it was fun nonetheless. 

As a Tron Game? I found it super interesting how they decided to expand the world of Tron and it makes me excited they're trying to reach out past the light cycles and disc games. IMO I don't really like some of the expansions to the world and the major secret trouble (no spoiler pog) feels a little off. However, I'm glad someone has a new take of what Tron can be. 

After all what is Tron? I think Tron is the exploration and intrigue of a cool idea. Discs, cycles, trees, and puzzles are just cool ideas branching off. I give this game a solid recommend. 6.5/10 for casuals and very enjoyable 2-6 hours of decently replayable experience. I'm off to do homework before starting a new run that's for sure.",1.0
865,136637117.0,2156300,"I understand that there will be more episodes later down the line. So the pricing isn't an issue for me. My issue is the lack of substance in the writing. The developer like the boast about how this is specifically a visual novel, but fail to understand decent writing is an important part of that. If you're going to disregard that the majority of your fan base came from your AVN college kings, then fine. But you'll have to come with your A game if you're going to leave out explicit content, and strictly rely on your writing merit. And FYI CK DIDN'T HAVE GOOD WRITING!

There's nothing interesting about the plot in this game. The main character is childlike and whiny, and his friends are unbearable. The only 2 characters that are solid is River and the brother Lance. Who the game is trying its best to paint as a bad dude, but instead paints the MC as a whiny brat who doesn't care about his family. 

All choices you pick are in a range of being either neutral or whiny. And a lot of the time, are confusing to understand in the context of the conversation being had.

The camera also needs to be zoomed out, by at least double. The amount of times I've jumped into a bullet off-screen is insanely frustrating.

And for a game where the grappling hook is one of the primary selling points, it's way to unreliable for height and found myself rarely using it after gaining other traversal methods, and avoiding it like the plague in boss fights due to it hindering way more than it ever helped.

868,136638755.0,1811990,"A very well made game with a wonderful cutesy art style. The player has a lot of control over the outcome of things, which doesn't always happen with deck builders, and there seems to be limitless ways to succeed. I haven't yet seen any bugs, and there haven't been any issues performance-wise, even though my computer isn't the greatest. Overall, I would highly recommend.",1.0
869,136638690.0,1811990,"I want to recommend this game if you enjoy deckbuilders and roguelites, but in its current state I can't promise you will have a great time. The mechanics themselves; the cards, abilities, effects, and companions, all have something really neat, but it's buried under a horribly unbalanced experience. I'm going to start by highlighting what feels incredibly weak on the player's end. 
The hero: Having a choice between three different heroes with random stats and abilities is fine on paper, but Wildfrost's execution of this leaves a lot to be desired. Your hero is frustratingly weak, has long attack cooldowns, and usually an attack stat of MAYBE 3-4. If your hero's death is your losing condition, they should feel more impactful. I know devs might not be the same, but this is the same glaring issue in another game chucklefish published; Wargroove. Another attempt to capture a niche but passionate audience but make lose conditions around losing your commander who has cool abilities and stats, so you are actually given incentive into NOT using them and mainly just keeping them safe. My hero feels weaker than first encounter mobs and can die in two good hits. One of the points of the genre is to start out weak and work your way up, but there is such a thing as too weak to even make it to the first step on the ladder. 
Companions: Cute feature and an added layer of deckbuilding to help guide you to a strong composition. Companions not only taking a card slot but ALSO a turn to put them on the field, is an exercise is design masochism. The enemies will usually have a field of 2-3 enemies, and 3-4 in some later fights. Forcing the player to start out 1v4 is unreasonable given the current card pool and balance state. I think being able to put charms on companions is nice, but I think I would have preferred a level up system where they progress naturally, since I am 4/5 times focusing on putting charms on my much more efficient companions instead of my hero. 
Cards: A basic system that works almost as expected. Again, the turn rotation and action allotment really hurts the experience. I am basically forced to place companions on the board before playing any cards that actually effect my enemies, and even then 4/5 times I am playing cards to keep me from losing instead of bringing me closer to victory. The cards almost feel like an afterthought when you look at Wildfrost's combat through the scope of an autobattler. If heroes could play more than 1 attack card a turn, the deck would feel a lot better to play with. 

Let's talk about enemies and encounters now
Enemies: Battles are randomized in a sense where you will face certain preset compositions picked from a pool. While this can present a challenge in the form that you are facing against a group of enemies that synergize with one another, it is also ball busting at times since they are much more optimized than you, the player can hope to be. Compounded with the fact that their board fields with units without a need to use a turn of action, you are often felt like you are fighting uphill the entire encounter. It doesn't feel rewarding to beat some of these encounters since not only do you not get anything besides currency, they don't feel like true wins since likely had just scrounged up protection for your hero and had cool downs tick at the right times. Enemy cooldown times are also extremely in their favor. If their abilities and attack stats were not so strong, this wouldn't be as big an issue, but whenever even ONE enemy is ready to do their move next I feel like I am forced to either slow them down, kill them somehow, or just accept that I'm making something eat the attack. Enemy compositions will likely appear that are an exact counter to your current build. Again, it wouldn't be so bad if the balance was in a better place. 
Map encounters: Cute idea, but not enough steps and impact on the run. I feel like with how powerful the enemies are, I need at least another rest spot or two to appropriately gear me for the next one. 

Overall, while this game has some decent art and nice groundwork for its mechanics, I can't suggest anyone pay the 20 bucks it costs just to run into the balancing problems a lot of people are facing. If decks, heroes, and companions were more in our control, yeah the difficulty could be managed as you can find a consistent way to overcome the encounters, but when you're thrown a bunch of weak combos that will not get you further than 2-3 battles, it just feels bad. I sincerely hope the developers take some of the feedback to heart and try to tackle the game's balance a little. It would be a shame for a project like this to just fade into the basement tote of generic and unsatisfying deckbuilders.",0.0

Nothing is colorful in this game. Everything is desaturated to the hilt. Everyone lives through misery. There's a stat called happiness. There's no happiness in this game. And there's certainly no emotions properly conveyed in it. I think it should be called a ""misery modifier"". And I'm not sure that the result of ""more happiness in a group"" should be ""increasing the MAXIMUM number of valor points in combat by ONE"". You start most battles with less than the maximum. Ridiculous.

The battle is boring. It's a snooze fest. I see the tactical potential, but it's just so bland and unimmersive, you don't feel like making any progress, it's just repeating a task (engaging, dealing damage) in which the ultimate reward seems to be something like +1 strength which lets you deal......... +1 damage ?

When you get 15 willpower, YOUR CHARACTER RECOVERS FROM DEATH after being killed ---- ONCE PER ENCOUNTER CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT. At 14 willpower ? +1 to Critical Hit. At 16 Willpower ? +1 Critical Hit.

907,136638483.0,1651560,"I often never leave a review, and reserve it only for such an occasion. This game is special. And a dev specifically asked for this as a favor in their Discord, so, ya' gotta do it!

Just to make it easy - great music, fun city builder, a great voice actor/narrator, and a wonderful combination of silly/cartoony and realistic as an art style. And at $15 or $20? Nah, go for it! Give it a try. 

A bit more in-depth - this game is made by a two-man dev team. Which is as mind-blowing as learning Manor Lords is a one-man dev team. With Fabledom, you feel the love they put into their project. There's a story here that will be fleshed out along with the game's development - delivered by game mechanics and a fantastic, sort of nostalgic narrator. The art style is very well crafted, allowing an indie team to seem like they're competing with PIXAR. The game has hints of Banished, Manor Lords, and in some sense, ANNO 1800. The game is calm and easy-going. I saw one comment that was pretty on point - Fabledom feels like how the new Settlers game should have felt.

And my top compliment - this game allows for travelling the map, and does a great mix of cute, cartoony city-building, with later-on added elements of combat. You can eventually build a castle and the surrounding walls, with both footmen and archers. 

Overall, support the game, support their art. Give it a try!

To note though - two negatives. One, as with most city-builders, the game is too easy. Again with other city builders, I doubt there's an End screen. The focus is of course actually building, designing, and decorating a city. But it needs far greater challenges and true game-ending events, if the player isn't focused or strategic. This might be mitigated slightly when combat is introduced soon.

Two - so far, nothing is really new here. You can tell there's love from the devs from this project. It feels like a game from the 90's or early 2000's when devs really, really were trying. I'm reminded of Halo...... But anyway, the game's great and it's fun to play. Buuut, aside from the story line, there's nothing really new here. Hoping to see what happens later on though!",1.0

Get a hero that's less than stellar at the beginning of your run? You might as well fucking start over because it's a 99% chance you're going to be wasting the next 20 minutes trying to build your deck into something functional only to run into a wall that absolutely obliterates whatever deck you've built. When I finally cleared the finish line it didn't feel like it was my skill or knowledge that was able to bring me there - no amount of scrutiny or cleverness or experience got me over those hurdles, it was primarily dependent on luck.

Sure you can sprint towards the enemy in CoD fashion, but they're going to gun you down quick if your team isn't there.

I read a review that said in order to level-up your character, you had to use coins. I don't see that anywhere, you can use the in-game credits which you get just from playing the game & doing daily/weekly challenges. Just an FYI.
I've also seen mention of a Battle Pass, but there doesn't appear to be one active now, so I can't comment on that. All you need to know is that ALL Battle Passes are trash and basically force you to pay to get anything decent from them. So I expect that from this game too.

Is it Pay to Win? I don't play the PvP modes, so I don't now, lol. Is it fun to play without paying anything? Yes.
Here is some quick info:
[list]
[*] Bots can kill you quite easily if you're not careful.
[*] Abilities run on Stamina, so if you run out you can't use them or sprint. - I love this feature.
[*] You have limited revives per person, with Medic having a few more than the others. Keep your Medic alive so they can heal/rez if need be.
[*] Special enemies can be deadly. RPGs, Snipers, Heavies, & Chemists. Chemists are the worst, they throw poison gas that AoEs the area.
[*] I've had the game lock up if you try to interact with too many things too quickly in the menus.
[*] Classes feel fairly balanced, with Medic not doing a whole lot of damage, Sniper doing great with head shots, etc. So you really need the whole team for the most part.
[*] Some maps are pretty unfair. There is one where you infiltrate a lab and go through a decontamination chamber. It fills with poison gas that constantly damages you & has enemies. You need to reach a button to stop it. I have never been part of a team that has stopped it.
[*] On that note, most maps with objectives have two different paths that you randomly get, so it adds a nice bit of variety. For example, on the above map instead of the gas chamber you go through a simple room where you kill guys and activate a switch.

[i]Plantera 2: The Golden Acorn[/i] is a worthy sequel that adds new stuff, but still is as short and cute as its predecessor.  It's an idle game, but it moves [i][b]very[/b][/i] fast.

The basic premise of the game is that you are growing a garden and raising livestock.  Right away you notice a nice-sized oak tree smack in the middle.  This oak is the only thing that you will not be able to move or delete in your side-scrolling garden.

You are asked to click on some butterflies to catch them for coins with which you can buy your first crop, leeks.  Eventually, you will be able to buy berry bushes and other fruit shrubs, fruit trees, and animals, all with drops to collection.  You also can have two production buildings: jam-making machines and windmills.  The buildings don't seem to depend on production chains, though.

Once ripe, ground crops need to be clicked to pull them out of the ground and clicked again to sell.  Fruit on bushes and trees can be clicked when ripe to make them fall, and again to sell.

Fortunately, you are given at the start a Mellow, a cute blue round helper with a bland placid expression and a bag over its shoulder.  You can just let the little guy go pick up fruit, or you can click on stuff to help him.

Hang out with the game, and you will notice various mean critters that show up to mess with your garden.  Magpies steal crops.  Bunnies eat ground crops.  Boars and foxes harass certain animals and make them less productive.  You can click on them a few times to shoo them away.

One tab, the Special tab with the blue star, includes some things to help you with the critters.  Scarecrows and fences help keep the critter population down and help you with offline earnings.  Guard dogs scare off the critters.

The coins you earn double as XP to level up your garden.  New levels give you more helpers, garden expansions to purchase, and unlock new crops and items.

Those levels come FAST!  Spend time with game adding or swapping out crops and expanding the garden, and in just two hours, you'll get 15-20 levels.  A few more hours, and you've unlocked everything.

Another progress bar tracks the acorns you've earned.  These upgrade the oak tree and add things like birdhouses and beehives, and acorns.  Regular brown acorns can be sold for coin, while golden acorns give you the upgrade acorns when sold.

After you've unlocked everything and gotten all the achievements, there's still a couple things left to do.  You can try to see how far the garden can be expanded, for instance.

As you expand the garden further, you might also completely remodel it.

The game gets cluttered and busy pretty quickly.  This is due to the layers used.  Ground crops take one layer, bushes and shrubs another, and trees a third.  Another couple layers are for the special stuff, and yet another for the animals.  Each crop/building layer has limited slots.  The game does make it fairly easy to move or delete stuff.  A layer toggle helps to isolate items to delete or move.  Prices revert to how much you have currently installed, so demolishing everything reverts to starting prices.

With a few more expansions, there's plenty of room to have each crop in isolation if you wish.

You also still keep leveling up after you've unlocked everything.  Crops and animals eventually earn star upgrades with new levels.  It's unclear exactly what this upgrades, though.

You'll also earn more acorns to upgrade the oak.  Acorns can also activate some God Mode powers, mostly to increase Mellow helper speed and crop production speed.

There is, of course, a restart function to start a clean new game, so you can set some challenge for yourself or just revisit the game.

The dev is open to suggestions to what to add to the game, too, so the game might be worth hanging on to for a while.


Graphics are bright and colorful and cheery, with the animals done in a fat, squat, almost cute style.  Music has a relaxing, bouncy vibe.

If you liked the first game, you'll probably like this game, unless the speed at which you  unlock everything puts you off.

If you want an idle game you can actually ""finish,"" instead of numbers rising to infinity, you might like this game.

If you like gardening games, but don't like the hassle of tilling and watering and producing stuff yourself, you might like this game.

932,136665133.0,1364020,"Incredible game but will take some time to fully grasp and has some places to improve. But it is Early Access so I’m looking forward to see how this game progresses!

Some things to note:

The tutorial is serviceable, it teaches you the movement controls and combat controls well enough, but it’ll take you some time to get used to unless you’ve played other games with similar space mechanics like Space Engineers or Hardspace: Shipbreaker. Something I feel it lacks is letting you know about how interactive the maps are. Until I bumped into something with a button prompt, I had no idea I could open/close airlocks, pressurize sections, or ride cables. The tutorial should’ve at least had an example of this because it is really cool.

The class customization and the classes themselves lend to a lot of variety but there are some classes that tend to be more popular than others. Some special ordinances are clearly better than others and I can see some balancing rework being needed for some.

The actual combat is just downright awesome and it really is a tactical space shooter. 3D tactics feels both empowering and threatening as flanking maneuvers are so much more dynamic. Combat is intense and the map design blends close quarters combat with large open combat very well.

Speaking of map design. They’re some of the best I’ve seen. They are molded perfectly to their respective game modes. The only problem I could see is sometimes spawn locations can drop you in right on top of the enemy if they’re at your spawn. I didn’t suffer any spawn camping but I can definitely see it happening.

I saw other reviews talking about bugs or bad connection, and they very well may have experienced that, but I didn’t experience any kind of problems like that. My game kept up good connection, consistent frame rate, no graphical errors, or anything.

Overall I highly recommend it and look forward to seeing this game grow. I hope it gets the love and recognition it deserves. Hope to see you out there!",1.0

Another absolute masterpiece from D'Avekki Studios! Murderous Muses is a first-person supernatural murder mystery game where you must discover who killed Mordechai Grey by investigating portraits that you hang throughout the gallery. The portraits come to life and give snippets of information which you use to discover the actual killer among the 6 suspects. This isn't a premade story on rails like many FMV games. It's a first-person adventure where you have to figure out what goes where and how, or risk missing out on important information. And every playthrough is randomized with a random murderer, evidence and environments! No two playthroughs look or play the same, SO much changes between playthroughs. You can easily play it several times and get significantly different experiences. 

The game takes place over a couple days, each having a distinct day and night time. During the day, you receive new paintings and place them across the gallery, discovering the history of the area and important lore about locations.  At night, the gallery comes to life and you can investigate the paintings for information.   

I really like how it doesn't hold your hand. You get a little tutorial and then you're let loose in the gallery. You need to do a bit of sleuthing to figure out how the mechanics all work. And if you blow through the days you can easily miss major information. You might not win your playthrough if you mess up enough, which I love. FMV games are almost always too easy, but Murderous Muses actually asks you to use your brain and powers of deduction. And since each playthrough is unique, you take what you've learned about the game to make your next run better while experiencing a fresh killer and set of evidence. 

Lots of little easter eggs and secrets and the cool collectible room ensure I'll play this quite a few times through. There is a ton of lore to be found and many ways to approach the Muses. My first playthrough was about 4 hours, but I'm piecing through everything I can get my fingers on, YMMV. Even when you've discovered the killer, there's still plenty to uncover...there's a lot more going on than just the murder. It should take 4ish playthroughs to get all the achievements.

I find Murderous Muses an amazing title, through and through. The acting, writing and soundtrack are overall incredible, it's replayable and SO engaging. I can't get over how much changes between playthroughs, and I'm absolutely enthralled with Mirlhaven. I can't recommend this enough. And if you enjoy this and other FMV games, make sure to check out D'Avekki's other titles. Every game is a masterpiece, they all play differently and they're all in the same universe!

964,136667838.0,1811990,"The game is fun and beneath the balancing issues is a interesting deck builder. But I have to agree with most negative reviews here. I LOVED the demo but what I think this game desperately need is a more divers path of enemies. For the most part you can make some pretty busted builds as usual for a rogue-like, but enemy encounters can just outright counter your deck strategy very usually since the game does not offer much diversity with deck creativity. If you could at least have two options in the path as to what enemy you are to face, I could enjoy myself without the frustration of praying as to WHO I will face. 
So prepare to be leaning HARD into the RNG luck of not ONLY what you get but what enemies you will face. You either synergize or die.",0.0

968,136667049.0,1811990,"This game has a lot going for it, and a lot that could be improved. Wildfrost nails the art, mechanics, acension system, UX and  ease of understanding. Everything follows a consistent logic which although it can take many tries to learn the specifics it has never left me feeling like they made a mistake. 

I would say that the game falls flat when it comes to consistency between runs. RNG is expected for the roguelike genre but in this case it affects every aspect of the game including the most important of your 2 starting units, the leader, which has to remain on the board the entire fight and if it dies its game over. All fights come as one of 2 versions, with a different set of enemies for each. The issue with this is that they can be WILDLY different in how tough they are. The events between fights are also mostly random - this is alright as the events are balanced enough and the shop events even things out because it's never required to buy a card at a shop, and the coins can be saved up at bad shops until you find one with the items you want.

By far the most aggravating RNG comes at the very beginning of the run with the choice of 1 of 3 randomly generated heroes. Some of the heroes are leagues stronger than others. It makes a huge difference in getting a run off the ground. Unfortunately, resetting after having a bad hero selection counts as a loss so if you care about winstreaks or win rates this adds frustration. I prefer not to start scum but winning feels way more achievable when I start with a good hero. 
This actually gets WORSE with the ascension perks as you only have one hero available from each faction. The starting faction is the most powerful, the 2nd one is good, and the 3rd faction is the worst. So although I will prefer using one of the factions I do not have much of a choice when the one hero from it sucks. Factions determine your starting deck and a large amount of the available cards during the run, which makes this very important.

The biggest RNG in fights occurs at the first boss fight. It spawns with either the King Moko or the 2 tall Mecha boss. King moko is essentiatlly a 7-turn death timer, in which you have to kill the boss before he attacks or else he wipes out your entire board. On top of that he has 60 health which is very high at that point in the game, so the only way to beat him is through having units attack him enough times that the attack bonus he gives builds up and is enough to chew through his health. The mecha boss on the other hand only had 18 health in the first phase, and 15 health in the second phase, and does 2 damage. The attack is super easy to tank in the second phase and 18 health is only twice as much as the regular enemies. I don't mind the fight being difficult, but the variation in balancing is laughable.

Now for the reasons why I like the game. I'll start with listing specific mechanics outside of the basics you're taught in the tutorial and through text:

combat order goes top down, from the inside of the board outward starting on the enemies side and then letting the players side go through actions. All effects tick after attacks have happened.

Noomlings make cards completely free to play, as such if you have multiple cards with noomlings in your hand you can play all of them without using your turn

Companions can be put into reserve (you still have them but they're not in your deck for battle) at any time, with a limit of 3 companions going into battle

All effects are useful on every unit type, including bosses. This is handy because it means effect synergies can't get hard countered, and remain viable in each fight. The only exception is that some boss and non-boss units have snow resist, which means that they can only have 1 snow stacked at one time. Snow is an effect which delays that units attack timer by the amount of snow, this stops the player from being able to prevent a bosses attack entirely. This is different to slay the spire, which has units which are immune to different types of effects. 

Mechanics like 'sacrificing' where friendly cards have to be killed to gain a bonus are not treated any differently from any other way of a card dying - in one instance I had a card which applies 4 overburn get sacrificed by another unit, and it ended up applying the overburn to my own unit, killing it. Heroes are also treated like any companions by other cards because my own hero got killed when another card triggered its sacrifice on the row it was in.

Why do I like the game, even with those issues I've described? I still find a lot of fun in the strategy that comes with every decision made - whether to go with what's best in the next fight, or try to find a broken synergy 2 fights from now. To build a good deck it's always a good idea to have more than one strong unit and synergy because many of the fights test decks in specific areas. There is one fight where the enemies all have a lot of block shielding which blocks individual instances of damage. If you used a strong single damage dealer to get through previous fights it adds a lot of challenge because the attacks of that damage dealer will only remove one block, the same as if it did 1. To defeat the enemies you need either a strong defensive setup which lets you chip away at the opponent's blocks or many fast attacking units to destroy their threatening units quickly.

The most fun I've had with this game was naming my cards and messing around with OP charm combos, when I beat the game with my leader called 'YOUR MOTHER'. Now she resides at the final boss fight every time, with all of the broken combos which I created with those units alongside her. Every time I've gotten back to that point since I have lost to YOUR MOTHER I'm determined to build a more OP deck so I can see what happens when I beat the fight for a second time.",1.0
969,136666865.0,1811990,"I feel mixed about this game, but right now the user reviews sit at 60% and I don't really think it deserves that.

I kinda forced my way through the game Slay The Spire, but I got all the achievements so I like to think I'm good at these kind of games.

People say this game is badly balanced but I don't agree with that.  The runs are just short so every fight needs to feel lethal.  That being said I do think this game FEELS random.  There is just so much going on in the game that it's super difficult to keep up with and I found myself not understanding how I lost.  Feels like sometimes the stars will align and either you'll just randomly kill the boss or the enemies will just randomly kill you.

I don't even have 6 hours and I already stumbled my way into my first victory.  After that the character you won with becomes the new boss, the game lets you activate special modifiers for a run, and I still have a lot of cards to unlock.

Notable innovations to the card-battler genre from an artistic and mechanical standpoint. Board positioning is essential, as is paying attention to the minute details of enemy effects and attack patterns.

This game is extremely punishing, and for me that is very motivating to keep playing. This is not a game where you can afford to zone out, and it holds tension even in the early battles of each run.

However, there are some changes that would probably make the game more fun. I think a system of re-rolling hero selections would be nice, because it's not fun to feel the need to play a hero that is almost identical to one you played in your previous run. There's some needlessly difficult interactions such as Monch insta-killing your avatar. It made me laugh, but it's really not necessary to have as many small ""gotchas"" like this to keep the game challenging.

I'm also not sure that forcing card selection from chests is necessary. Similar games such as Slay the Spire let the player opt to take nothing at all, which is often preferable than making an off-synergy pick. The large hand-size and bell re-draw system does already mitigate the drawbacks of having a dud in your deck, but I think the game is challenging enough that it could support players running leaner, meaner strategies earlier.

Or, as much as I like the injury mechanic, maybe just remove it or make it reduce the creature's stats incrementally rather than by half? 

Who knows without play-testing, but I'd consider some graceful ways to slightly re-balance.",1.0

+ Only a couple loading screens. Some levels fade into one another. 
+ Talking about levels, it deviates from the regular 'convoy' theme at times and gives you trains, planes, exploding barrel trucks and even the sandworm from Dune. No, I'm not kidding. There is a giant sand worm. 
+ The grapple hook is free to use with any weapon. Nothing beats grappling to a group of enemies, letting the minigun rip and tear them apart! 
+ The fast paced, metal soundtrack. 
+ The enemies are styled like punk / post apocalyptic goons. 
+ The easily affordable price. 
+ One of the achievements for falling off the train is called 'Follow The Damn Train, CJ!'
+ Sometimes the enemies kill themselves by jumping and missing a moving truck, which is very kind of them. And funny. 

Things I Don't Like: 
- The pixel style of graphics: The indie shooter's unimpressive go-to for art style. Dusk. Nightmare Reaper. Cultic. Ultrakill. Gloomwood. And now MeatGrinder. It's just my preference. I don't like it and I grew up playing Star Wars Dark Forces 1+2! Although, this one is actual 3D all the way through. 
- Within 28 minutes I had a lot of repeated voice lines from the protagonist. I even turned down the frequency in which he speaks, but it didn't stop him from saying 'I LOVE THIS SONG' every time the music changes. 

Overall, an absolutely killer title for the price. 
And I totally recommend listening to the Mad Max Fury Road chase music if you get bored of the metal.

The meta-progression is very well implemented and allows you to push further and further every single run, You will get crushed by new foes over and over again until you adapt. But not at any point frustration will kick in. Every run allows you to play a completely different style and with the different tribes you'll have even more variety.

Every single encounter could end your run, leaving you on the edge, while your cute creatures fight other more angry cute creatures.

1010,136668319.0,1811990,"I was a bit turned off from getting the game, since it's currently sitting at an unsteady 60% review ratio. Now I will say the game isn't ridiculously hard as it sounded like it would be, but there is a lot going on and if you miss an effect that an enemy has or misalign your characters, it could result in a bit of a mess or injuries to a character or two!

But the fact that one of the more popular reviews states that they had 20 runs in 3 hours, and had somehow managed to die in the first battle is shocking! In my 3 hours I had 4 solid runs and made it to the third zone, with each run being a different unique setup than the last. I made a mistake or two in a couple runs which didn't ultimately end them and still did alright.

King Moko specifically was rather daunting, but I made it through the fight by quickly bursting him down with debuffs and sun rods. However the third zone though with wild boars I fucked up real fast and attacked one with my leader and died instantly. That, while frustratingly silly, was totally on me and forgot he'd just counter attack twice. 

Otherwise I played at a bit of a slower more meticulous pace, paying attention to enemies that had effects like giving armor to other enemies, or the enemy that causes aimless on your party and targeted them with cards rather than depending solely on my party. Switching people around to avoid big hits and using weak dummy deployables to tank big hits was very important for fights.

I'm not a fan of card games at all (Slay the Spire being the ONLY other one I play), but it isn't impossible to get into. There are a lot of ways to approach fights with cards, and if you don't figure them out you may struggle a bit with the game since it's less straight forward than Slay the Spire since you have a field of characters to manage that attack independently of played cards like the freeze attacks and such.

TLDR: The game has a lot of charm, the artstyle is lovely, and the music is great. There's a decent variety of build potential with cards, and it is super satisfying to figure out what works with what. It rewards patient play and a bit of experimenting. However, some enemy effects (eg. causing aimless to your party) can be frustrating since the fight partially is out of your control and you have to rely on in hand cards and a bit of luck on top of that.

Overall I'd rate it positively, but a couple battles can prove to be frustrating but it isn't anywhere what I expected from some of the reviews and the 60% rating. Of course it's still an early review so it should be taken with a grain of salt and ideally it could use some adjustments too.",1.0

There's a wide range of different species that can be grown, from fruit trees to flowers and vegetables. There's also a great variety of animals that can be raised, such as chickens, cows, and sheep. Additionally, there's a large number of items to unlock, such as gardening equipment and farm decorations.

The gameplay in Plantera 2 is very fun and addictive. The game starts with a small and simple farm, but as the player earns more money, they can expand the farm and purchase new plants and animals. There's also the possibility of hiring workers to help care for the animals and plants. However, as the farm grows, it also becomes more difficult to manage, making the game challenging.

The graphics in Plantera 2 are excellent, with a lot of attention to detail. The characters and animals are well-designed and the colors are bright and cheerful. The soundtrack is relaxing and helps create a peaceful and pleasant atmosphere.

Although I enjoyed Plantera 2 very much, there are some weaknesses in the game. The lack of a plot or story can make the game a bit monotonous and without a clear goal. Additionally, the gameplay can become repetitive after a while, especially if the player has already unlocked most of the plants and animals.

Overall, Plantera 2 is a fun and engaging game with many plants, animals, and items to unlock. While the lack of a plot may be somewhat disappointing for some players, the gameplay itself is very satisfying and addictive.

You can see tracers and the Sun reflected off your helmet. Your character breathes heavily and you can hear the oxygen rushing out of your suit. Sound doesn't travel in space, and the game is starkly quiet as a result (but still full of rich sound design) I have spent the last hour in game goggling at my surroundings with my headphones at full volume to appreciate what this game has going on. It's really well done in all aspects, including in the menus.
-The game's visual design is great- the UI/HUD elements and ingame assets fit really well with the theme and everything goes together nicely. It remains to be seen where cosmetics will be taken (and I really hope against all odds they stick to the theme of high-tech space). 
-The gunplay is extremely satisfying when it's flowing well- when everything clicks it feels really well done. AAA quality for sure.
-The movement is mostly well considered and feels very fluid despite your character being in a clunky spacesuit. The grapple and boost mechanic are great for getting around.
-I appreciate the small aesthetic flairs- the weapon animations are nearly fantastic throughout (with a few small janks here and there), and I am a big fan of the character flairs given to each class. 
-Stability is great so far. Have not experienced any frame drops, lags, stutters, or crashes (thank UE4)

CONS:
-The translation quality to English is very poor at this time. A few things remain in Chinese, and the menu elements are pretty poorly translated throughout. The entire game needs a thorough pass by a trained localization team. 
-The HUD (ESPECIALLY the customization menu) has some information but is lacking many critical details. I saw a community guide up earlier that EXPLAINED each side pod's function, which is notably lacking from the game itself. Good luck trying to figure out what anything does at this point.
-A lot of gameplay elements are questionably balanced and don't seem to serve a function at this time. For example, there is a medic class but there isn't really a tangible purpose to healing your teammates as everyone is very dispersed around the map- and it's really difficult to land the healing device (?) anyways. 
-Some QoL stuff is missing, including what is mentioned above. You can't exit out of a match in the pre-game lobby, and the pre-round timer is too long.
-Some of the maps are not very good. The crash site one invites a lot of pot shots from across the map and a single choke point (a choke point in space! can you believe that?) contains a lot of the fighting.
-Engagement distances are kinda funky as CQC is rare- it's weird to figure out where the shotguns and SMGs will be effective compared to longer-distance weapons.
-For some people, the unlocked axes of movement could probably cause motion sickness.
-Some aspects of the movement are questionable- the landed state is clunky to move to and from, and the momentum brake isn't so useful when you can stop as is. Stick to the grapple for now.
-The tutorials are adequate but leave out lots of helpful info. See above regarding the lack of info in menus.
-The game desperately needs a region lock, and maybe more servers. I am playing against China/SEA players with 300+ ping on a regular basis.


NEUTRAL:
-A lot of the cosmetics in the game so far are directed towards a Chinese audience. Expect a lot of the items ingame right now to seem a bit strange out of context.
-I have heard some reservations from others about the Tencent anticheat but I would wager Tencent has as much data from me as Denuvo and EAC at this point. Download at your peril!!!

OVERALL:

The game is not anywhere near a finished state, which is to be expected in Early Access. I am still really excited to see Boundary improve over time, and I think it has the bones of a very solid, high skill gap, beloved competitive/casual FPS. The developers will undoubtedly encounter rampant sinophobia in a western audience and the challenge will be to warm people up to the unusual concept of space combat, but even in an early state, I can see a lot of love and polish in Boundary. 


Verdict: Maybe wait awhile to purchase as the game is pretty unpolished on Day 1. The price is more than reasonable for what's on offer at $25. I will come back to update this review as the game changes.",1.0

I love the narrator and the art style is so cute. I like that it has all of the foundation and mechanics from most city builder games, but has more of a cozy gaming feel where you can just sit back and relax while designing your fairytale kingdom. 

Scrolling through the kingdom can get very slow and laggy if you unlock a lot of the map, but that may be my computer not being very good. I’m really excited to see more of the world map interactions with other kingdoms. Disappointed to find out that castles and a other food source buildings won’t be available for a while, but I rather have early access and be here through the process than wait for the game to be fully done. 

Overall this game is so much fun. I was able to put in a lot of hours first day until I finished all early access content…. And then an hour or two more after that. And in excited to check out the creative mode and build some monstrous cities. Devs should be proud.

You can play it grabbing the table, OR moving the girl with the sticks. The ""grab controls"" method is very original but difficult. It's based to the old labytinth+ball games mechanics. The other method, I'd call it ""sticks controls"" method, is way better from a ""gameplay"" perspective (and I feel good with triggers for ""world"" rotation).
As far as I played, I've had a good fun. Some items interactions are a little ""clunky"", however the in-game puzzles are cool and the exploration is interesting. 
Good game, for a very  low price.

1031,136669888.0,1968710,"My immediate response to the ending was ""NO! [i]NO![/i] THAT CAN'T BE IT! [i][b]THERE MUST BE MORE![/b][/i]""

So yes, I liked the game so much that my biggest issue is how short it is. Unlike [u]Portal[/u], [u]MEATGRINDER[/u] doesn't really have the writing or story—nay, not even the pretence for a thrilling climax. Thrilling set pieces, most certainly, each one better than the last, but the game doesn't so much reach a satisfying finish as it does just end. There are a couple of cool bosses in the game but we don't get one very last boss to wrap things up, like a giant robot spider using tanks as skates.

But those set pieces really are good, I must say. From the very second level, jumping between trucks and flinging away bandits running and jumping at you never stops being fun, and then they just keep introducing new elements in each level to make it so much more fun and exciting! Having said that, while the final two levels are visually striking and dynamic, enemy placement is repeated and the gameplay loop doesn't flow as well so shooting enemies isn't particularly fun in them. However, as the levels are pretty damn short and it IS an amazing visual spectacle, it's not a problem at all as you'll only go through them once anyway.

I have a few more issues:
[list]
    [*]Not all weapons are created equally. The minigun feels and sounds rather underpowered compared to everything else and it heats up way too quickly. Also, there's really no reason to use the pistols once you've gotten the second weapon.
    [*]Hard Mode is, ironically, too hard. I think it's fine to punish the player more for falling on the road but a one-hit kill is far too unforgiving when the game is so chaotic that what you're standing on can just leave you far too suddenly and get you killed, or car placements are too far spread out that it's impossible to advance. 
    [*]The game is... visually weird? When enemies are close to me, it's hard to register a lot. I kick at them but there's little in the way of visceral feedback that tells me I've actually done it apart from the enemy suddenly not being in front of me anymore. Same goes for when I'm shooting them with the pistols. I guess this combines with the minigun issue of weapons lacking solid feedback, which could be remedied by sound effects.
    [*]I get you're inspired by [u]ULTRAKILL[/u], what with the graphics and that whole three-line intro bit at the start, but those things are just cheesy. Those things aren't what make [u]ULTRAKILL[/u] great and having those elements don't make you [u]ULTRAKILL[/u]. This game sets itself apart in so many wonderful ways while being alike in so many wonderful ways so those things just baffle me, really.
[/list]
Overall, though, I loved [u]MEATGRINDER[/u]. The sheer creativity and thrill behind every moment of the game makes me very excited for what Vampire Squid do next. I WILL say that, while I can appreciate a game focusing on gameplay over story, there's no reason why they can't intersect and work off each other. All games are enriched with context and boomer shooters are no different; [u]Metal: Hellsinger[/u]'s one example of this and even [u]DOOM[/u] 2016 uses the themes of the original [u]Doom[/u]'s tropes as good storytelling devices, from the Doom Slayer's violent reactions to everything and his lack of speaking. 

I'm not going to ask for long cutscenes and exposition. This game is, after all, about flow, and cutscenes like that would be just as flowbreaking as Hard Mode with all the deaths on the road. But surely the gameplay itself could tell the story; voice lines from your avatar that aren't pop culture references, enemy designs and voice lines, and even the set pieces themselves could result from decisions made by everyone involved in this crazy imminent pile-up. All the same, this was really cool.",1.0
1032,136669699.0,1567000,"Just finished the game and gotta say it has a style. It's not pretending to copy modern shooters or create new mechanics. It's just let you follow the flow and get the vibes with absolutely fantastic level art and music.
""Crazy"" atmospehere of the game and all that inspiration from classic artists and sculpturs supported by music which let you escape from reality and forget about all others needs.
I think a good advice on clearing levels is to follow the pace of the evironment - do not hurry and look around you. There's no need to run it as much fast as possible rather get that ""tone"" of the game and just enjoy!

1047,136671218.0,1811990,"I'll echo what some of the other positive reviews are saying: a lot of the negative reviews are just a skill issue. Period. I think that there are legitimate criticisms to be made with the game, but my god. As of writing this review the game is sitting at a 60% review score and that is just simply unfair. One of the top reviews as my writing this complains that they died multiple times in the first fight in the run and that they had 20 runs in 3 hours. Having played around 5 hours myself, and having no prior experience with deckbuilders in the past, I can honestly say I have no fucking clue how that dude managed to lose the first fight enough times that they felt it necessary to note it in their review. 

The game is challenging. It is, sometimes frustrating, but I can honestly say that most of my deaths have been because I made a mistake, and I was playing too fast. Some reviews are complaining about needing some crazy luck or needing a perfect build, and that is just not at all true. I think maybe one of my runs was extremely lucky, and it wasn't the run that made it to the end. With smart play, making the most of your resources, and attention, you can make the most out of the vast majority of your runs. I can not emphasize enough that the reviews blasting the game about horrific balance and extreme difficulty are likely playing too quickly, just generally, but certainly in battles (once again, as a complete newcomer to the genre, no clue how one would manage 20 runs in 3 hours). And to say that the different enemy types require an exact ""answer"" is just flat out wrong. A wide array of strategies are entirely viable, and I've had great success with several, frankly entirely unoptimized builds. The game requires careful thought and each decision. It isn't ""impossibly difficult,"" it just requires patience and for you to not rush through every turn. I don't mean to outright attack other reviewers, but I worry the review score will drive away prospective new players. Most of the negative reviews are severely misguided, and clearly aren't engaging in good faith with the mechanics the game provides.

I can't say it is perfect, but I can say I've had a great amount of fun with it, and the current review score is criminal. It could absolutely do with some tuning, I can't disagree there, there are certainly some cards that just feel worthless, but to say that the majority are unusable is laughable. There is a legitimate criticism to be made in the games draw system, as it at no point informs you that you will be able plan out your future hands by looking at your deck and your discard pile. This is an extremely important mechanic, as it eliminates a rather large random element, and I only discovered it on accident.

The design, both visual and sound, are delightful, and full of little touches that show that the devs clearly had a great deal of passion for this game, and a great deal of enjoyment for it. Please, please don't be swayed by some of the less charitable reviews. The game is more than worth your time, and I don't regret my purchase for a second. I rarely if ever write reviews, but I felt I had to for this game. If I had to give a rating, it would be sitting much close to 85%. There are legitimate criticisms to be made with this, in terms of some design aspects and balance, but it's hard to have that discussion when the majority of the negative reviews I've seen have been made seemingly in bad faith by people that grew frustrated with a game that demanded their attention.

This game is not ""impossibly hard."" This game is not ""all rng."" It requires time, attention, and a great deal of player input for every decision. Saying that there is very little the player can influence or do is a flat out lie. I have saved what seemed like unwinable positions and lost what seemed like a sure thing, entirely on my own competence.

First off, the visuals and the music are absolutely top notch. To the point of sometimes distracting you form the actual gameplay to just appreciate them. The tactical nature of the combat with the positioning of your units feels very rewarding when you begin to understand it. Also, the way you constantly keep unlocking new stuff via small achievements is great.

Now is the game hard? Yes, a lot, but It's certainly not unbeatable. I don't know why people are so focused on winning the video game that they can't appreciate the process of loosing, figuring out why, learning from it, and trying new strategies.

1077,136670663.0,"17,980,101,798,020","Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection Vol. 1 is a compilation of the first three games in the Mega Man Battle Network series, which are action-RPGs that combine real-time combat with grid-based strategy. The games follow the adventures of Lan and his NetNavi MegaMan.EXE, who fight against various cyber-threats in a futuristic world where everything is connected to the internet. The games feature a unique battle system that allows the player to customize MegaMan's abilities with various chips and programs, and also switch between different battle styles that affect his stats and skills. The games also have a rich story that explores themes such as friendship, family, identity, and morality.

The Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection Vol. 1 is a great way to experience these classic games that have aged well and still offer a lot of fun and challenge. The collection also includes some bonus features such as concept art, music player, and online netbattling and trading. The games have been enhanced with HD graphics as well as E-Reader patch cards (in Volume 2) which were previously only available in Japan. The collection is a must-have for fans of the series, as well as anyone who enjoys tactical JRPGs with a twist.",1.0

This collection is great and unlike some collections/ remasters you get much more than just the games:
Artwork, Music Player, MegaMan HIMSELF and much more all these extras make this collection much more charming.

As for the games themselves they are quite unique ARPGs with Cardgame like mechanics.
I love the characters and the stories are better than one would think. 
Personally of this collection MegaMan Battle Network 3 is my favorite game, but they all held up great.

I never was able to play these games with friends so I'm super happy they included online with this, can't wait to try it out.",1.0
1082,136673430.0,1798010,"Even before playing this I was pretty likely recommending it. The games themselves are good as it is, but Capcom went the extra mile and gave us online functionality and even made sure things like event-only distributions are accounted for here. The packed gallery and BGM player along with a nice suite of options means that this is THE way to play Battle Network.

Unlike the X Collection or the Classic Legacy Collection, the general change in style between 1-3 and 4-6 mean splitting this up into 2 volumes is definitely a smart move. Even with how the game changes between the two halves, it never truly feels like 1 through 3 are obsolete games. They still have a lot of good to offer and are totally worth picking up, but I can see why some people would stick to either Volume 1 or Volume 2 on their own.

As for the games themselves, what's there to say that hasn't been said already? Battle Network 1 is rough around the edges in a lot of ways, but the core ideas are there for a very fun game. You might want to play it first if you feel like you're not going to appreciate how much changed over time, or you might want to come back to it when you've seen why people love this series so much. Just bring a map with you because getting lost can happen often.

2 improves on just about everything that people had issue with in 1. It's still got some issues, but it definitely feels like a much more cohesive product with a refined look and feel. I remember this also having way more bonkers online than any other game in the series, with so many cheese strats and lopsided balance that can be fun, but may not be for you.

3 is definitely the peak of the series. It's not downhill, but everything just seems to come together perfectly for 3. Further fine tuning to the gameplay, the addition of the Navi Customizer to let you enhance Mega Man in all manner of ways, slightly better balance among the Style Change forms, and a meatier story that gives us a suitable finale for what can be considered the first ""arc"". The version split, while definitely a way to cash in on the Pokemon trend in some ways, does have some viability in Battle Network, with a unique boss in either version and some unique chips in each library. However, Punk is only actually in Blue, since Blue is actually just the enhanced version of Battle Network 3 made to look like a separate version. Tut tut, Capcom. At least later games actually are built with version differences in mind.

Battle Network is probably a cornerstone franchise for the GBA, and for many is going to be how they first found Mega Man. It's great to have them in this form, including online functionality, and even if you're not into Mega Man, you'd be getting into a rock solid action RPG with a unique setting and unique mechanics that has a ton of content worth sinking your teeth into.",1.0

1103,136673090.0,1527950,"A good game I would not recommend.
The camp building is fun, the crafting is fun, I do like the profession minigames actually!

It is a lot like battle brothers and incredibly charming, I love a lot about this.
Why do I not recommend it? Because difficulty is done poorly in my opinion.
What do I mean? Well, let me explain.
Generally, challenge is a curve, while your strength goes steadily up, most games start out very hard, you become stronger and the curve swings down, you have reached a point where your new skills let you feel powerful. Then slowly the curve swings back up and new opponents and challenges approach, which allow you to truly be put to the test with the things you learned. Then you slowly gain new skills again and it becomes easier, so you feel rewarded about your progression.
This loop is how most games work.

Now, wartales instead is... two straight lines overlapping. You level up? All enemies instantly level up. You gain a new member? All enemy parties are suddenly bigger.
This is both immersion breaking and makes combat a bit of a slog. Battle brothers did this too, but to a far, far less noticable degree, where enemies felt like they slowly ramped up and when you got stronger there were still plenty of weak and fragile bandits.
Here suddenly even the refugees are 12 man parties swarming you like they think they're zerg, when they started out as 3 man. This means every combat is the same level of challenge, you never feel rewarded for getting stronger, because you know combat is just getting harder instead, so instead of saying ""yay I got a new great member!"" you think ""god damn it, now I'll have to fight 12 enemies every fight... I hope they don't all get the buff that makes them do 5% hp every attack"".

There is no reward for stronger, because enemies are always scaled up to your level, in fact it would almost seem that the more I advance, the weaker I get, as enemies scale even harder. It's... not very fun and it turns combat into a slog.
Battle brother does it very well, where enemies don't really get stronger, but gradually stronger parties with new enemies show up.
They don't do that here, it's just level 5 refugees with torches burning you down, and super elite bandits.
It's still the same bandits as in the early game, but now they're super boosted and there's 20 of them.

I want to recommend this game, but they just need to rework the way they do enemy scaling. Because like this? Well, the only result is always gonna be an immersion breaking slog of combat.
Improving your mercenary group should let you have some moments of victory.

Because when every battle is the same difficulty, and you never feel like you are growing stronger, and you're always fighting the same enemies scaled exactly to be as strong as you, every battle is completely forgetable and you stop caring about progressing.

You have some amazing systems, in my opinion the way battle actually plays out is very good, but the scaling is too much. When it comes to enemies and scaling, learning from battle brothers might be a godsent.

- Amazing music.
- Lovable cast of characters, both friends and foes alike.
- Beautiful locations, both in Lan's world and in Mega Man's.
- Fun gimmicks per each entry, such as Cross Fusion, Double Soul, etc.
- Amazing pixel art.
- An overall very exciting and enjoyable adventure.

Cons:
- Random battle shenanigans being a wee bit too frequent for my taste. (At least for MMBN1. Been a long time since I've played these games, so I don't quite remember if the rest are as... Saturated with random battles as MMBN1 is.)

That gripe aside, its a fun game, and the sequels fix a lot of past issues.

Battle Network 2: adds so much more compared to BN1. More areas to explore Battle system tweaked for the better, and the story is pretty good.

Battle Network 3:
This is in my opinion the best BN game. Battle system has been expanded upon greatly, it introduces the customization system to make your play style your own. (a few complaints where you have to use certain upgrades for specific parts in the story) Speaking of, the story is my favorite of the 3. And the post game has so much do do.

To begin, I don't think the game is polished enough to justify a RM 50 cost. It still has some bugs. Omnem does fix them quickly though once reported, so it should fine given time. Single Player is fun for a bit, but it runs into some issues. Karmic Years do not decay and the amount you get from getting sieged is basically none(2 common years,really), making ai allies requires prefect ideological alignment(may get fixed when crises update comes out), and some stats like accident related deaths aren't really clear on what they do. Influence gain is way too slow for rapid expansion, even on the most forgiving settings, and it can be hard to find resources needed all the way to late game.
At least karmic years can be fully disabled in SP. That said, there are a few suggestions I would like to give.

A general resource mapmode filtered to a player specified resource as well as on nations for trade would reduce frustration on finding goods wanted by players.
Allow players to set up their own lobbies with custom settings, and add some additional settings, like guaranteed resources and karmic year decay over long periods of peace or after a set amount of time.
Clear up some stats on what they do exactly.
Add some way to increase influence gain, both in game and in pre game settings.
Make the ai easier to ally via multiple methods.

The game can be played with a fixed set and a randomized set. The former is good for understanding the views of the author and can be metagamed, but the sp victory requirements that scale with time suggests that the latter is the intended set. This is fine, a small adjustment for the fixed set or even sliders would be nice though.

The game does have a charm of sorts despite its flaws. I enjoyed reading all the flavor text as well as the events, and finding ways to break the game is enjoyable. Omnem does a pretty good job on expressing them self within the dialog and has heart put into it.

I would carefully recommend the game, but be might not be for you if reading isn't a thing you like to do.

The community, while small compared to AAA games, is extremely passionate about the game and want it to succeed.  While I hope it does too, there are some lingering issues I've been hearing since the initial playtests came out.  

I am more than content leveling up operators and weapons and ignoring most issues as the game's atmosphere, graphics, and music are all incredible and I'm generally easy to please when it comes to early access games.  There's truly no other game like this and the level of immersion had been a huge focus of the team.  What I'm hoping will become the focus are some of the lingering issues I mentioned - few modes, server issues + ping exploits, lack of explanation for most items, and a less than stellar UI.  Now that the game is out and the team is very aware of these, we'll just have to wait and see.  Many of the complaints I've seen in Discord and Discussions - LOTS of spawn camping, snipers being overpowered, bad hit reg, poor aiming - haven't really been my experience.  Every competitive FPS game has similar issues and not to sound like a jerk, but most of these can be combated by changing playstyles and/or getting better at the game.  You can only block so many times in Dark Souls before the need to roll is made clear, you know?

I've enjoyed many games that unfortunately never made it (Hawken, Dirty Bomb, Lawbreakers, Radical Heights, and Last Man Standing to name a few) and I truly hope Boundary doesn't make that list.

[b]+ Embark on a journey towards sainthood in the dark and eerie world of Stigmata of Sacrilege!ヽ(´• ω •`)、[/b]

[h1][b][1] Intro [/b][/h1]
Stigmata of Sacrilege is an action RPG game that follows the journey of Sophie, a beautiful orphan who is blessed with a sign from the Lord that she is fated to become the next saint. The game is filled with many enemies and bosses, all with unique attack patterns. In order to become a saint, Sophie must overcome her trials for sainthood and seek blessings from various holy sites that have become dungeons. 

[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]

What sets Stigmata of Sacrilege apart from other adventure games is the inclusion of adult content, which can be unlocked through a special H-patch provided by the publisher. This content enhances the value of the game, adding a sensuous and sensual element to the already engaging gameplay.

The gameplay in Stigmata of Sacrilege is fast-paced and challenging, with many enemies and bosses that require careful strategy to defeat. The combat system is well-designed, and the game offers a wide variety of weapons and abilities that players can use to take down their foes. The game also features a leveling system, which allows players to improve their character's stats and abilities as they progress through the game.

One of the highlights of Stigmata of Sacrilege is its visuals. The game's graphics are stunning, with detailed environments and beautifully rendered character models. The game's sound design is also excellent, with a haunting soundtrack that perfectly complements the game's dark and eerie atmosphere.

The story of Stigmata of Sacrilege is intriguing and engaging, and the game provides a rich and detailed backstory for its characters. The game is set in a dark and eerie world, where many devious and nefarious demons stand in Sophie's way. The main character, Sophie, is a sympathetic and likable protagonist, and her journey towards sainthood is both fascinating and inspiring. The game also features a cast of supporting characters, including Claire and Grace, who are both interesting and well-developed. 

Of course, as with any game, there are a few drawbacks to this game. The game's controls can be a bit finicky, which can lead to frustration during intense battles. Finally, the game's story can feel a bit predictable at times, with some plot twists feeling a bit forced.

[h1][b][3] Verdict [/b][/h1]
Overall, Stigmata of Sacrilege is an excellent action RPG that is sure to appeal to fans of the genre. Its engaging story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals make it a must-play for anyone who loves action-packed RPGs. The inclusion of adult content adds an extra layer of excitement and sensuality to the gameplay, making it a great choice for players looking for something a bit different. Highly recommended!

Have to say the only improvement is the graphics, all other changes are just fillers and unnecessary, if not to say, laughable horror scenes. The remake is much easier. I did not expect, that the same riddles would have been implimanted, but the whole ""New Orleans""-part, took me an hour at most. When I played the 2008 version I have spent at least an hour at the safe alone.

Now the thing that realy drives me mad about this game. When we arrive at the hospital, I was quite surprised to see Dr. Gygax had become a woman, I am sure there were a lot of female administration staff in hospitals back in the days. And that all the staff memebers had decided to wear very obvious red amlets.
May I remember that this part of the game takes place in Switzerland? And then,  there is not even a German synchro for this game.

And then there are these stupidly made emotion scenes.  The developers take your picture of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson and throw it straight into the rubbish bin.

Last Frogwares game I have bought, did not buy any of the new games already. But I did not expect them to fail the remake like this as well.

There are also updated physics to mention, and the exclusive tables for the new game look gorgeous! 

The biggest problem that most Pinball FX enthusiasts will face is that they own up to 80% of the tables and have paid only a fraction for each through the various Pinball FX3 sales over the last five years. There is no way to move these tables to the latest platform, which is just another barrier to enjoying Virtual Pinball. Don't get me wrong; it's not like Zen will pull Pinball FX3 from Steam and somehow remove the owner's access to the tables they already own on the previous version. They are just creating a distaste for PFX3 owners and potentially confusing prospective consumers for the new version of Pinball FX. 

It's bittersweet that such a solid offering can drag itself down by not giving the most loyal fans a path to bring tables forward and take advantage of the apparent benefits without repurchasing every table. The alternative option is to spend endless money purchasing monthly or annual access to the tables, which is nothing I am interested in. These access passes may be a good option for others, and I will encourage everyone to play these tables as they see fit. 

In the end, I'm going to hold off for the tables to go on sale and pick the ones that I don't own first and slowly ( and cheaply) pick up the remaining tables that I deem worthy of a second purchase.

Enjoy!

1224,136618219.0,2328760,"Not impressed, ""Pro Physics"" feels like flippers are made of jelly (lack strength and accuracy), not realistic and not arcade-ish like FX3 either.

And only for that change and some other minor visual improvement (that looks completely overdone and creates a lot of visual disturbance), they're charging people again if they want to play the tables they already bought in FX3 / FX2, using some ridiculous bundles to make it seems like ""it's a great deal"" for all those FX3 players.

Optimization is not good either, performance is all over the place, loading times are quite high for a simple pinball game (even worse than FX3). Tables (both old and new) are overpriced, at least in my region. Table achievements are missing.

And they also sell coins that you can use to purchase monthly and yearly subscriptions. Yeah, I'm gonna subscribe to a pinball service, sure. Good luck selling this one, ZEN Studios, I'm not gonna be part of it this time.",0.0

1229,136662678.0,1949030,"[b]Normal Game Stuff[/b]

The environments are really nice, lighting and graphical fidelity overall is awesome with Unreal Engine 5 goodness, and the sounds are really good. You can feel the London gloom and the Louisiana heat. Stuff like footsteps on various types of terrain and the sounds of opening and closing doors are some little details that really increase the realism and immersiveness. High level of polish on everything.

Game wise, initially my main point of comparison was Call of Cthulhu - I now feel that’s a bit unfair at least from a gameplay perspective. CoC is an RPG. The Awakened isn’t. It’s a detective game, so pretty much all the gameplay is puzzle solving, mostly piecing together clues to figure out what happened at a scene. There’s never any time pressure apart from a few isolated events. 

The game is also completely linear. There are dialogue choices you can make, but they don’t affect anything in more than a cursory way. There’s only one ending.

[b]Horror[/b]

I consider myself a coward when it comes to horror, and this game is fine. There are a few semi-jumpscares (and they’re delightful), but not many, and most of the “horror” is the analytical discovery of what happened at a crime scene. I actually wish the game had more horror content to make the threat feel more palpable.

[b]Mythos Treatment[/b]

This is the stuff that really matters to me. CoC had jank, but I liked how it treated the Mythos, so that’s the bar to beat.

To me, there’s 2 crucial elements to this kind of Lovecraftian tale: the slow buildup of dread truth, and the protagonist’s inevitable descent into madness (i.e. their reactions to the truth being revealed).

The Awakened unfortunately falls over a bit here. Where CoC got freaky not too far in and then kept ramping up, the Awakened layers on the Mythos to hook you in at the start, pulls back through the middle, then ramps it up again for the end. I was particularly disappointed at the middle section, where human horror is the focus. I don’t want the Witcher - humans are not the real monsters. If you’re telling a Lovecraftian tale, sure, humans are monsters, but the real monsters are the [i]monsters[/i]. [spoiler]This is the Awakened’s biggest weakness - we never directly, incontrovertibly see a Mythos creature. We don’t see a Deep One, and certainly not Cthulhu. We never get confirmation that the Mythos is real. There’s definitely brain-bendy stuff going on that speaks to Sherlock’s mental deterioration (in particular there’s 2 actual scares in the first half that have stuck with me), but there’s always plausible deniability.[/spoiler]

Sherlock’s reactions to stuff are mostly good - like I said, the voice actor for Sherlock does a really good job of someone supremely confident in their mental faculties struggling when those faculties suggest things that don’t make any sense. This is particularly true in the final confrontation with the big bad. I love the climaxes when [spoiler]there’s the dialogue between the insane, zealous antagonist and the protagonist who desperately wants to deny the truth but can’t. The moment when it all becomes too much, and the protagonist’s hold on traditional reality breaks and they finally give in to the awful truth of the universe -[/spoiler] those are the moments that I love the most about these tales, and despite the lacklustre buildup, the Awakened sticks the landing really well.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

I would wait until this game is on sale to play it. It’s too expensive unless you’re craving this specific thing. It’s consistently middling with a very good climax.

If you’re craving a Mythos hit, play Call of Cthulhu - it’ll be way cheaper for one thing. It has lower lows (older game jank, and prolonged tedious stealth sequences) but also higher highs ([spoiler]getting violently dismembered by a Dimensional Shambler, actually summoning Cthulhu[/spoiler]), and you’ll get to see way more actual Mythos stuff and feel more scared of it. It has skill points and skill checks. It has multiple endings. It has a R’lyehian language. It has a sanity meter. God I love the sanity meter in that game. I know it’s a reductive and inaccurate depiction of mental health but I don’t care, it’s amazing. It starts full and never ever increases, it only ever goes down. Some dialogue options are locked if your sanity is too high. The descriptions of your character’s slowly deteriorating mental state are freaking great. If you want this, play CoC.

Anyway, that’s the end of my review. Hope that was helpful.

1230,136662307.0,1949030,"I feel awful leaving a mostly negative review because I love this series and I know that the devs had a difficult time trying to get this game out while their country was being invaded but I don’t think it’s as good as it could be.

For starters, IMO the best two games in this series are Crimes and Punishments and The Testament. Both get at the heart of Sherlock Holmes mysteries and really demonstrate the game play one would expect. The Devils Daughter was so bad I almost didn’t play Chapter One. And while I thought Chapter One was a little sad, I enjoyed it so I was excited to see what they would do with The Awakened remaster. 

Now this remaster looks great and I like that it references Chapter One but that’s about it. It’s too short (which I get because of the devs having to deal with real life issues) and linear which can make the side cases added to the main story difficult to complete because you can’t go backward. The mini map is difficult to use because there’s no pointer to show where you are on the map. And I know the devs like horror games, but I think this leaned to heavy into that direction while forgetting how to tell a true Sherlock Holmes story.

And the thing I really didn’t appreciate the most was the ending. Sherlock is quirky but he’s not insane. I think the devs are leaning too hard into exploring what makes Sherlock tick but have gone off the deep end. I really hope that if they continue this incarnation of Sherlock, they pull back a bit on that. Or I’m really hoping they go back to what they did for C&P and the Testament.

I think next time I’ll wait to preorder the game.",0.0

1232,136663651.0,1772830,"Rusted moss is an extremely beautiful and rewarding game play experience with a main focus on movement. The main draw to the game is that there is no double jump, only a grappling hook. This means that rather than trying to time a midair jump you have to carefully plan a big swing or drop in order to try to make it to your destination. This control scheme allows for extremely fun and addicting game play while also having an extremely high skill cap. 

Oh and did I mention there are ROCKET JUMPS!!!! Yes that's right just when you thought your bungee grapple hook experience couldn't get any better the devs added a ROCKET JUMP! so now you can blow your enemies sky high and fling yourself through rocket propelled means!

I personally put over 30 hours into just the demo of this amazing game and for around a 10-11 hour experience this game ticks all possible boxes for me! Overall this game is very rewarding if you take the time to learn the mechanics as even after 30 hours im still constantly learning more about the physics of the game and the more I learn the more fun the game becomes.

The general aesthetics were extremely pleasant, and reminded me a bit of Momodora; what story and lore there was looked very compelling; and oh - most importantly, the gameplay was fantastic. Platforming felt great, the grappling hook had a slight learning curve but quickly felt like second nature and opened up so many options and so much depth. Now that the game is out and while I'm not nearly finished with the game yet but I am pleased to report that the game is everything I had hoped it would be - maybe more. 

Everything I said about the demo holds true for the full game so far, and in terms of new observations: The game does an excellent job of providing a well structured critical path, while rewarding expert play with an incredible amount of free-form exploration which often feels sequence breaking (in a good way,). Exploration is extremely rewarding, offering skill-testing platforming challenges, exciting new guns and items, interesting lore, and brutal optional bosses.

1242,136663292.0,1893370,"Even 20 years later I still have a soft spot for anything that reminds me of the original Unreal, I remember before I had my own computer I would play it with friends in the game cafes back when multiplayer games were just getting popular, they only had 5 games installed, Starcraft, Half-life, Quake, Diablo2, and Unreal. It's a shame they are no longer on Steam, granted I think the genre has been going downhill after UT2004, they tried but it could capture the magic -  that awesome music, simple gameplay, and just satisfying carnage. This game attempts to capture the spirit and the soul of those games, but it also adds a twist to it which I did not enjoy. 

Everything outside of the core gameplay is a bit lacking, the only thing this game does really well is just the feel for the weapons and the character movement (except the bots, they are kinda junky). The current story mode only has about 70 minutes of content, so you really not getting a lot for the price. Now, you can play against bots in the custom games, but the AI pathing is very bad, pretty much making it pointless, especially in the domination and the ""capture the flag"" mode. Also, I feel like the maps need to be bigger, the bots respawn almost right on top of me, and there is never a window where I can actually benefit from killing them, it's easier to just ignore them, maybe there needs to be a respawn delay.

Interestingly, this game is not what you might think, I don't want to say much more than that to avoid spoilers, but it's not in a classic format where you progress in the arena, although I kinda wish it was, something like UT2004 would be more appropriate here, I would prefer a team management game. There are some gimmicks in the narrative that don't work, every time I am trying to enjoy the gameplay it has to interrupt me in order to do some narrative gimmicks. If I compare it directly to Unreal Gold, there is only 1 big stage in this game, and even that is only 10-15 minutes,  the tension that I felt running away from Unreal predators is just not there. 

I am seeing a lot of praise for the narrative here, but outside of some funny cheese from 90s there is really not a lot to say, it's very cliche at this point to have any kind of mind games. If anything, I think the Unreal story part was told through a good level design and navigation, and I find that many stages in this game didn't get the same treatment. 

[h1]Pros: [/h1]

(+) With the exception of the AI, I think the character movement and the weapons feel good. I find the game plays a bit too fast compared to  UT so tracking with guns can be a bit unpredictable if you play on high difficulty, but if we can just make the hardest AI less teleporty, I think it would be fine.

(+) The game seems to use the same or at least similar sound effects, for the most part, the actual atmosphere is very nostalgic. I mean the music is not as good, but I mean, how many games have better music than UT, not many. I appreciate a little bit of 90s action voice lines.

(+) I do like the visuals, but I think the dev is missing the point with some of the levels, it depends on the location, I think there is a lot of room for improvement, you could even rely more on platforming to create challenges since you can move so much in this game, don't be afraid to create more verticality for the player to jump around.

[h1] Feedback: [/h1]

[u] Enemies & Level Design [/u] - one very big problem with this game is that many enemies are not actually fun to kill. Like, you have these guns that have nice impact feel to them, but some of the story parts have these stupid projectiles that you can't see or some random birds. I have not seen any decent enemies that are not bots until one of the last stages. Honestly, you should completely remove all of that poorly color-coded junk, all enemies should be chunky and fun to kill, try to combine Unreal with Doom for the story parts.

The arena stages are too small specifically for the team modes. Also, you want to put the respawns a bit further back so the bots don't come back instantly when you kill them.

You need to make longer levels with more optional navigation, the only stage in this game that kinda matches what I expected from this game is the one with the robot boss. It often feels like you are running through an empty level with nothing to do. Also on a side note, try to avoid overusing any dark corners like the stage with the acid, even if the texture is not great it will always look better than just dark wall.

[u] AI [/u] - the pathing on the AI is very bad, and yet if you play on the hardest difficulty it's very hard to track them with a gun, the movement in this game feels maybe 30% faster than UT so it's almost like they are teleporting around (assuming they don't get stuck like they often do).

[u] Narrative [/u] - if that is what you want to do it's fine, my problem is that it feels like the game takes the control away from me all the time. Like, let me play for 30 minutes, then inject some narrative you know, if you play mind games every 5 minutes it's not going to feel like an Unreal game, you still need some immersion with the level exploration, and that means stop interrupting the gameplay.

[b] Overall Thoughts on EA 4/14/23: [/b]

I think the game gets the atmosphere and the gameplay right for the most part, but when you look into the details, like the magic of Unreal level design, it needs a lot of work. The story is a bit too much in your face, you want it to feel more natural, don't force mind games on player, more game, fewer interruptions. Probably not worth what the dev is asking for it, I expected more than 70 minutes, or at least an arena mode that is fun to play (the AI sucks). 

Unreal has some sentimental value for me so... I figure many people would find this a bit underwhelming, but it has a few nice things going for it.

Absolutely no lag.
Graphics look great with ray tracing.
Too early regarding the physics ( I shall update in time) it is different not sure for better or for worse yet.

I have read reviews on here from people having so many issues but I have not.
The difference between the graphical finesse of this version compared to Pinball FX 3 is blatantly apparent.
Some are saying they cannot see any difference but honestly they need to go to Spec savers.

Some are saying it is slugging even with the card I am using but this is not so.
There may be something wrong with their systems /drivers/ whatever.

I have bought three tables the Williams new ones.
I have played a few of the others but the polish shines through on the original tables far more than any others.

This version is not an essential purchase but more of an option to play the newer tables ( least for myself).

The pricing here in Australia seems reasonable and I suspect some of the bitterness in reviews is people using a potato and so they are stamping their feet ranting because they 'wish' they could play it.

Anyway like I said, politics aside this is worth it for the new tables of Williams etc.
I own all of the tables on the older version but doubt I shall be buying the Star Wars and other such Marvel etc.

I shall likely stick with buying only original 'new' tables.
Graphics all highest settings ray tracing on 9/10 on the Williams tables.
Sound: Seems crispier and more base better spacial reproduction.
Game play: Different from the last version the jury is still out but seems good.

Value for money for the tables: Well pinball is my thing and I shall eventually probably re-buy the original Williams because they look so damn good, yet not with immediacy.

All of the other tables I likely shall not buy at this point.

Verdict if you're on the fence.
It is NOT an essential purchase unless like me you're a pinball simulation addict and want all the bells and whistles.

There is NO fundamental reason to buy it if you're on the fence FOR EVERYONE ELSE.
Overall score and verdict:
9/10 A must buy for the new Williams tables.

You can view my initial impressions review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/BcbFdvH3lx8

If you enjoyed playing Kill It With Fire (Non-VR) then you're going to enjoy this VR port. It is a bit on the janky side though. However, it's just fun to be an agent of chaos in VR.

You get to kill Spiders in a plethora of manners. You have silencers, shotguns, revolvers, flamethrowers, molotovs, explosives, bazookas, a frying pan, etc. You can set the whole world on fire with your single-minded quest to kill any possible spider that may be out there.

If you enjoy explosives, this game is for you. If you're an aspiring arsonist, this game for you. If you just hate spiders, this game is for you. You can follow the objectives for each map or just do your own thing. The only thing that matters in the end is to kill all the spiders by any means necessary.

Game is running on the Unreal Engine. On my RTX 3080, on high graphical settings, I did experience some severe frame rate drops / stutters ... usually when lots of stuff exploded. I should have probably lowered the graphics to medium though. You have full locomotion or teleportation available, along with smooth or snap turning. You can play comfortable seated, as there is a button crouch, height adjustment, along with magnet hands. There is some jank though grabbing items or using your inventory, etc.

I think the game is fun, if you like retro shooters you probably will like this one too, I played almost 3 hours and not sure how much longer left in game but overall I think it's a good game. 

Visual are cool, specially the lighting of the game felt really nice. Game play is fun and can be challenging at some areas. There are variety of enemies to kill and as developer said it's basically killing horde of enemies. There is no story you just progress through different levels which each one has a very unique design too.

The only think that I didn't like was music and to me it felt out of place and disconnected from the game, had to reduce the music volume. But it might be just a personal preference.

I’m honestly content with how much Capcom put into this spin-off series.

Aside from my good thoughts on the BN series , the craziest thing I could say about these games especially the show (NT Warrior & Axess) pretty much predicted today’s current tech (PETs = smart phone devices, able to jack in to devices such as ovens, TVs, doghouse I know lol, etc. = Internet of Things).

I must admit that I have lost in this game... a lot! So, is it hard? It certainly can be. But unbalanced? Personally, I don't think so. The unique mechanics and strategies can be challenging at first, but I think it's a good kind of challenge. Every time I lose, I can see what I could have done differently to give myself a better chance, or decisions I could have made to be more survivable.

The game has a unique gameplay setup where you have two rows with three places on each row. You can ""crown"" units so that they are available to be played on the first turn. You can also reorder units and recall units to heal them, then replay them later. There are also a variety of cards that synergise with the units. There is so much depth to this game, and it gives you a lot of strategic options to explore.

This is what this game does, it invokes adventure.   I really am liking the survival system, and managing your partys gold. food . The more you explore, the more the map uncovers for you.

1. Bad net-code. 
A friend of mine had to restart his computer after 5 minutes from the start of the co-op session because wartales somehow completely froze the system. His computer specs higher than recomended system settings and he had never face with such problems before.
Second situation happened in the 10th minute of the game, we came into salty mine talked with npc but later understood that we can't leave this location. Any our actions had no response.

2. Lack of information at the start of the game
My friends and I bought this game just to play together. In a co-op session, you have a tutorial about the game mechanics, but there is no introduction to introduce the player to the world, and no explanation of the main objective.
Maybe this will be explained later, but it would be nice to get a brief overview of what the game wants from the player at the start of the game.

[b] Distilled gameplay elements with a survival and resource management synergy leads to a fun and replayable experience! [/b]
https://youtu.be/l-vbXDYvoh8

TLDR in case you don't want to watch the video:

1. Its less complicated and in-depth compared to bigger scale turn based tactics games (like X-Com), but the synergy and decision making during missions makes it equally intense 

2. Aside from the obvious turn based tactics comparisons, the resource management and survival elements like food, rest, stress levels, and shelters give the game another dimension that add onto its already tense combat. It's simple enough to understand, but tough enough to make it so much more than just a walk in the park

3. Its not award winning writing and dialogue, but the environments and side missions / events certainly add onto the world building and lore in Shardpunk's grimdark steampunk world.

4. Despite its rather short campaign (about 5 -6 hours on normal difficulty), the wide variety of characters, skills, tactics, quirks, campaign map, and overall types of playstyles, give it so much more replayability!

Its not the next groundbreaking title in the genre, but it certainly is a well executed amalgamation of some of the best turn based gameplay elements, and more!

I would recommend fans of turn based tactical games to give Shardpunk a try!

Finger Soccer is a Unity Asset flip, what Valve calls a ""fake game"".  The ""developer"", 小小游戏, took the [url=https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/finger-soccer-game-kit-45611]Finger Soccer Game Kit[/url] Unity Store tutorial/demo/game asset pack from the real developers, Finalboss, changed the name, and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get $4 USD of your money for someone else's work.

The products that result from asset flips aren't ""real"" games.  They lack depth and content, because they're just simplistic copies of demos or tutorials.  In this case, ""Finger Soccer Game Kit"" is just a game pack/template to teach people how to make a soccer/physics game for mobile phones, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so a copy+paste of it can't be recommended.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  Sure, sometimes they may change a few cosmetic things, swap out different assets etc, but at heart it's functionally identical to the asset they're ripping off.  In this case it's a direct 1:1 copy of the asset with no noticable changes. 

Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

1333,136734112.0,1949030,"As a nostalgic player of the original title I was super thrilled about this remake. 
I won't hide it: I love this younger Sherlock. I loved him in Chapter One and having him going through this adventure. He is freshing up the series and it was very entertaining having a younger and less experienced sherlock solving the case. 
Connecting his emotional status with the events of Chapter One was so on point. I was a little skeptical at first 'cause this is basically the very first adventure with watson (where in the old games they know each other from a very long time) but their  reletionships was developed very well. 
Knowing the rpg of call of cthulhu it's like sherlock is failing all his sanity rolls while getting all the intelligents rolls. 
Althought I didn't quite like some of the changes from the old title, others where perfect and heartbreaking.
They used the same gameplay as chapter one, which I liked, but a couple of old style puzzles would have be a nice reminder of the old title. 
While the supernatural thing in devil's daugher was meh, Lovecraft horror works incredibly well with sherlock. 
It is a good title (maybe a little too rushed in the writing) both for old and new players.",1.0

1335,136733208.0,1772830,"The game's incredibly fun, mainly having a rocky start as you get used to the game's titular mechanic the ""hook"" as the game basically forces a crash test on the player to know the ins and outs of its physics and how to manipulate it to the best of your ability. Once you understand how everything works it feels satisfying to land tricky jumps as you squeeze the physics and the movement tech for all that its worth.

If there's any issue I have it's that though the grappling is amazing when doing things like gaining height and doing tricky jumps, certain parts of the game require more... ""control"" and precision that the bungie cord mechanics simply don't provide. Otherwise it's a nitpick on an amazing game.",1.0
1336,136734973.0,1811990,"The game is quite hard but I feel like many reviews focus a bit too much on ""winning"" rather than just enjoying the game for runs. I feel like beating the game is only icing, the real fun is playing through the game and using what you're given and I want to say no, you're not always given the opportunity to win even with the best of skill sometimes but I do want to say most times, winning is definitely within arm's reach. That said, I still do have my gripes about the game:

1.) The starting leaders doesn't seem to make any rhyme or reason to how they are balanced. For example, I can be given a 12hp 5attack 4turn leader and while also simultaneously be given a choice of a 8hp 4nut(shield) 3attack 5turn leader. The second leader is very similar to the first except that it has 2 less attack and has one more turn of count down. Like why? The only explanation I see is that they're from different tribes but the tribal differences isn't THAT big to ever pick the latter leader in this scenario. I can never see a reason why any leader should be 3 attack and have a 5 turn count down - not even if they have frenzy, in fact, 5 count down leaders just shouldn't exist, period. There have been many multiple other instances of just crappy leaders and there's no way to ""reroll"" them without starting a run and quitting (which makes me feel dirty).

2.) There are some enemies that are incredibly hard to deal with and more notably, two types of enemies that consistently ends my runs. The enemies I'm talking about is the acorns that gives 3 thorns to all allies and the other acorn that makes all YOUR units aimless. These guys always spawn together and it is completely brutal to have to deal with because the aimless causes you to attack randomly within the row while the thorns is well, going to likely kill your units, especially given how the average hp of units is 5hp, getting just a couple unlucky hits in means everything of yours is dead. Now this wouldn't seem nearly impossible to deal with except that the health of the acorns are like 14hp so not only can you not control which enemies you're hitting in that row but even when you do get lucky, you have to get lucky multiple times. That is just in no way acceptable that these enemies exist with that much health.

All said though, the game is fun, I just don't think playing it with the mindset that you're going to win every run is realistic and quite honestly, that's the way rogue-like games should be. Sometimes you're just given crappy choices and you just have to make the most out of it.",1.0

1338,136734392.0,1811990,"Ignore the negative review. The game is good, but with 1.5k+ review on 3 days after launch, there are bound to be questionable people around more than usual.

The art is amazing. The music is exceptionally nice and reactive. The gameplay is highly innovative.

The game is roguelike first and everything second which means you will lose and lose a lot. This does not ponder or feed the questionable mind of ""modern"" gamers who cannot stand losing and just scream ""uwah ah oh no I'm 3 hours into the game and I still cannot win the first fight consistently. this is clearly a balance issue."" or ""uwah ah oh no I'm 10 hours win and cannot even get my first win, this is clearly a balance issue."".
Yes. The game is highly unbalanced, and it is one of the main issue right now but that doesn't justify the amount of negative review the game is getting. The first fight is definitely winnable by any means and there might be some case with cursed bells that will just make you lose but it's just roguelike in general - you are not meant to win every run.

The glaring issue; however, is the bs randomness the game can bring to your run which can be unbearable at times (yes I'm talking about you dangling cursed bells), but if you are playing casually the first few fights are definitely doable and can be won quite consistently (I'm looking at you shademancers).

Another problem is it's a card game that requires skill to play, so it might not pander certain group of people too.

So all in all it's just crying gamers wanting to win everything without caring if they're having fun or not spam their frustration on unjustified ""wah wah unbalanced make me lose 100% fight I cant even do first fight this is clearly balancing issue"" negative reviews.

If you don't care losing and just like roguelike in general, the game is for you, but if you are not just stay away. It's just that simple smh.

PS. to dev if they are reading this (though I doubt they will since the amount of comment is aggravating) please recognize how random-ish your game can be and change some achievement required to unlock some amulets. Just make them separate achievement with no unlockables instead. Winning 3 times in a row in a highly volatile and random game - really???",1.0

I see many ppl complaning about balance, some even claming you have to follow some kind of ""meta"" to get past the 2 first encounters but thats just not true, the game gives you a stupid amount of free controll during your turn(you can move around your units as mutch as you like, optimizing damage taken you can even for free recall units and they heal up). Like other games the endgame becomes ""scale up FAST"" usually but thats not a bad thing, the amount of ways to synergize your cards in this and the interaction between cards are staggering, for example did you know you could use flamewater on cards in your hands instead, for example on slapcrackers(4x random attacks that deal 1dmg) to doubble its damage output instead of putting it on an 6 counter unit. I hate to be this guy but if your complaning that the game is ""unbalanced"" or something simular then just git gud and start reading what the enemy cards do.

1341,136734033.0,1811990,"I feel like I need to leave a rare review to counteract some of the negative reviews here...

I dont know where many of these reviews are coming from maybe the beautiful artstyle of the game has attracted many people that never played a rougelite deckbuilder before but the difficulty in this game is not a problem at all. Is the game difficult? yes to some extend since you are required to build working synergies and actively think about your turns. This gets more complicated since the game gives you a lot more options in combat due to how the positioning and effect systems work. This is not a bad thing though and it is precisely because of the options you have paired with the relatively narrow scope of each tribes deck that you have a lot of control about what happens in combat.

Every effect and ability is cleary written on the cards and works pretty much as you would expect. There are some peculiarities that you need to work out when first encountering stuff (for example how the turn order works for cards or that units that consume allied cards will never eat the enemy leader) but after that it is always the same and reliable. I think if you read a card it is very obvious what purpose the card serves and which other cards would have good synergy with it.. Attack buffs are more valuable on multi hit targets / snow can be used to disable certain mechanics etc.

It is still a roguelite though so you will have some runs where you just dont get a working synergy ready in time for the difficulty ramp up. Due to the options the game gives you and the mentioned before relatively narrow scope of each deck these cases are rare though and can often traced back to bad decisions the player makes.

Each Enemy clan/type and boss requires some specific handeling  that you will need to keep in mind throughout the game. Many other rougelites work with optimizing builds for a hyper specific approach which employs the same strategy for every fight and then proceeds to steamroll the game. Such a thing doesnt really work here since you need to keep your approaches rather varied. If you rely completely on one slow heavy hitter you will be fucked by shielded enemies. If you build completely for rapid multi hitters you will be fucked by counter enemies (if you dont circumvent them which the game allows you to do). In short until you have a few runs under your belt and know what to expect you will create builds that have failure points. Again this is normal for this genre and part of the learning process.


The game so far has been awesome and I have had a lot of fun figuring out the best move in any given turn and many seemingly unwinnable battles were clawed back to victory not because I randomly got the RNG god card but because I managed to outplay the enemy setup turn for turn which in my opinion is much more statisfying than randomly pulling  the I win card.

1344,136733487.0,1811990,"First thing first, since I've played the game from the first demo back around 2022 October, I've been in love with the game. Basically innovating in the Roguelike Deckbuilder genre since Slay the Spire started it.

The visual and sound of the game are incredible. The art for each cards and the designs of characters within the game are so cute and will appeal to everyone. The music when the game is still in its relaxed state, then intensifies in combat and boss battle are amazing. Not to mention how solid the system of the game is, every click on the card or the bell is satisfactory, interacting with map events are great (like crushing the ice to get a companion), equipping charms is always fun, and many fun interactions too. Many can be improve with QoL still, but still solid at launch.

For these alone, this game is already great. But.

Now for the elephant in the room, which the majority have already written. I also agree that the balance of the game is out of whack. It took me 8 hours of gameplay and multiple tries to finally win the game for the first time. I've since started 10+ more runs and yet to reach the final boss again (which is[spoiler] my previous run winner, and I consider that is pretty cool)[/spoiler]. And I just play this genre of game casually.

Now I still do recommend this game for its innovation on the genre and solid system overall, but definitely not for the casuals deckbuilder players. Because compared to other game in its genre, Wildfrost is like Darkest Dungeon in it's early access days. Unbalanced, Stiff (in a way, you can't play your way, you have to play how the game wants you to win), and you are slave to the RNG. You can build your deck to stack one or two effects to make it strong on the first 2 battles, but then you're gonna hit a wall where your deck is useless and you have to restart again and again and again and again.

Now the unbalance does not only applies to the gameplay, but also on how it affects the players. Sure every roguelike/lite games is about making mistakes in your early runs and learn from it so you can make improvements on your next runs. But if the majority of the run you make is a failure to learn from, then the game became a chore, because you have to learn instead of just play.

That's why in Slay the Spire have the option to make the game harder for you with the ascension system, while the basic gameplay is as easy as it comes. It is more accessible and balanced for the players that just wants to play casually and those that wants to tryhard.

That's why in Hades, you can make the game harder with modifier to torture yourself with, while the basic game is a simple hack 'n slash roguelike.

--

I still like this game, and willing to be crushed over and over again since I love playing roguelike/lite games (although StS is only the RL-deckbuilder I've played). But I can't deny the game is unbalanced as I've written, and I hope it can be balanced just like other game in the roguelike/lite genre. More accessible for the casuals and still challenging for the tryhards.",1.0

With the game being released I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised with how the game turned out.

Wartales is a game with a lot of similarities to Expeditions: Conquistador and even a little of the Banner Saga.
At the start of the game you decide what type of initial squad and backstory you want to go with like being a bunch of wanderlust farmers wanting to seek their fortunes to former soldiers running from the war to bandits who have escaped prison. The decisions at the start helps to ground you to the world and inspire you to role play as the type of squad you chose. You get to fully customise four characters like choosing the sex, appearance and character traits, one for free but if you want two positive traits you must pick a negative trait to counter balance it. 
For example with my squad I made a big viking dude with a shield and club who was strong of arm and very stout but his negative was that he ate more food than the others because he was so big and strong.

The comparisons to Expeditions: Conquistador begin when you start moving around the map to explore and find new locations that have different quests and events tied to them as well as fight tactical battles battles on a square based grid (Expedition: Conquistador used a hex grid though) and begin to level up your companions and have some minor role play events with them as time goes on. Each area of the game has its own story/quest line and there are different endings for them. The first area of the game is a hot bed of refugees running from away from a war in another kingdom.

The comparison to Banner Saga is that initial battles are very much you take a turn then the enemy takes a turn but unlike Banner Saga you are not punished for killing enemies and as such you get more turns to use. The battle system also allows you to chose which character to use on your turn so for example you wanted to start combat with your big shield dude you could run them in first turn or you could use your archer and shoot at the back line on the first turn. This is different from most tactical games because in those games you have to take turns in a certain order but in this game you can chose the character you really want to move instead of having to wait till the end of the turn to use that really slow character.

The game is very fun to play and enthralling; it is the little moments that help make this game like when my archer Erin kept accidentally shooting the de-facto captain of my bandit group in the back and while camping he tried to have her kicked out but the other bandits said it was a mistake obviously and to forgive her just for her to shoot him in the back again in the very next encounter and for the de-factor captain to get a paranoid trait after it happened.",1.0

1383,136643560.0,1527950,"I came to this one after bouncing off Band of Brothers, and this game definitely has some of the same similarities - managing a mercenary company that needs to be constantly fed and paid and dealing with the pressure to push forward against the risk of permanent loss.  It's an ironman-lovers formula, where stories told are largely generated by your decisions and the rolls of the dice. 

Wartales is much more personal, however, with your initial starting band sharing a small history you decide, and each character having particular jobs and roles in your found family of bandits, heroes, or mercenaries.  The death tolls aren't quite as high (although it's possible I'm just bad at Band of Brothers), and the personal growth of each character feels nicely paced and carefully managed.  There are all these little, simple systems that categorize how you are progressing, from your knowledge of the world leading to general party perks to each characters individual relationship.  

The best example of what Wartales is, I think, comes from a simple thing I found in the first few hours. in firing a shot from an arrow into a crowded fight, I hit an unlucky 20% and accidentally shot a companion.  This wasn't a fight ender, but it had two specific mechanical consequences: 
one, the two party members relationship deteriorated, 
and two, the wounded member developed a new perk called Eyes in the Back Of Your Head, to prevent such occurences from happening in the feature.  
That's the core of it - tight mechanical tactical combat coupled with consequences that are narrative on a personal level. 

I could speak a lot to the games seemingly open nature and the really elegant nature of its combat and experience systems, but its whats in between them that most fascinates me.  This game uses its quiet preparation time really well - despite fairly light procedural dialog, the small systems interlock in a way to create a sense of family and camraderie in your little band that feels meaningful.  Because of the non combat class system the characters you're risking aren't fully featureless fighters - they're also the ones that cook your meals, or smith your weapons, or do your laundering.  They're people that  you care about.  That's a hard trick to pull in a game of this style, and its definitely worth price of purchase even if you're only in for a few runs.

The music score is amazing, the art is amazing, and the vibe and style just feel so damn good. It's almost like a Little Nightmare vibe with some Inside but all morphed into a dope FPS shooter + with it's own jam. On that note the controls are tight and the shooting is spot on. There is a jumping mechanic and puzzles and secrets so that will keep you busy and not just focus on grinding the trigger. Also gibbing enemies is like a pimp pancake breakfast you keep wanting more. It all just feels really good.

Another note the blood effects and lighting all are super nice and it adds a lot to the game. It's a UE4 game and I have perfect performance with no stutters what so ever or shader issues so that is pretty cool.

Note - if you play with a gamepad(XB360, XB1 or XBSX) and want to invert the thumb just get Xbox Accessories from the MS store and just make and activate a profile to fix the game.

Works out of the box well with the upcoming Universal Unreal VR injector from praydog. With the recent addition of a toggle for head locked aiming this is pretty fun to play like that. Would be a good candidate to add further motion controls to as well. 

Game is pretty difficult even on Easy and relies on you to use the manual quick save/ quick load system. Think the default game-pad mapping is okay but is better when the jump button is on a trigger or shoulder button. Would help if the quick save and quick load buttons were also on the controller as well.

Has ten levels, each with hidden secrets, can be replayed with harder difficulties and modifiers. Has a gun that shoots leeches :)

3) the physics seems way off (regular and pro), regular is floaty like a gummybear on a trampoline, and pro's nudging is too sensetive two nudges relatively fast after each other and instant tilt & no warning, especially hurtfull if you use a controller (irl i can drag save a machine a inch or two (5cm) in tournement settings and still not get tilt or a tilt warning).

4) issues that carried over from the epic version , Keybinds constantly reseting after a restart of the game, Event tournements like ""flip challenge"" and ""time challenge"" ending early.

5) Some of the models on tables look worse than on a VPX recreation it

1411,136675071.0,1911360,"This game reminds me of Dead Cells, but with smoother movement like in Metroid Dread. The combat is really fluid and responsive, and you need to be careful with your attacks, dash through incoming attacks, and combo your enemies to death. Some tougher ones can even be stunned with an extra stun bar.

It gets more risky in some rooms where you get swarmed by several at once, and need to properly strategize some crowd control.
Once you beat the first boss and meet the second character, Kera, the game and challenges really open up. Kera has lots of melee combos available. And the third one’s gameplay feels more bullet-hell, with long range aiming.
You still have to get in close, as all the better/special weapons use an energy bar, which only gets filled when you use your main weapon.

Run lengths are not too long, from 7-15 minutes per stage, but it’s well worth exploring the whole map, to increase the power level and get better weapons.
The mods are pretty basic right now, but maybe they'll add more special ones or some clearer synergies.

Overall, game is most definitely worth recommending. It has extremely great potential, no doubt.

1412,136675343.0,1911360,"Early Access Review

Interesting setting, very good art direction/asset quality/animations for an indie.  Currently it's a bit basic in its initial early access state, but it's clear that the game has potential to turn into a very solid metroidvania/roguelite.

There are 3 ""worlds"" with the main character having a different version of herself for each one (though functionally this doesn't amount to much yet).  As you beat the boss of each world you unlock a new traversal ability for that specific character.  You gain 2 different meta-resources (orange and blue) to help you strengthen your upgrades, though currently they are pretty lackluster, just minor stat increases.  Orange unlocks new upgrades to be purchased or increases your upgrade slots, blue is what you use to purchase the upgrades.  The second tier of upgrades includes a revive, very useful, work towards that ASAP.

The ""fusion"" mechanic isn't really fleshed out at the moment.  In later updates it looks like the 3 different worlds will be fused together in a way that promotes more thoughtful planning and preparation from the player.  Currently, you can find a terminal in a run to ""fuse"" with one of the other 2 versions of yourself from the other worlds, increasing your health, granting you one of their spells/abilities, traversal ability and giving you a new unique look for the remainder of the run.  It's a nice touch, I just wish it was more accessible and more than just a flat combination of the 2 characters.  So far nothing is in the game that requires you to have 2 different traversal abilities, but it's clear to see how it will be utilized in the future (hopefully).

All in all it's a fun enough game while it lasts.  The current state of the game is somewhat short, I got to the end of the current content in around 4-6 hours (a good understanding of how to dodge enemies will almost trivialize the game and shorten your playtime) but I enjoyed what I played.  

Looking forward to the games progress.",1.0

Bosses are pretty challenging not because they are particularly inspired in design, but due to the small boss arenas, big hurt box on your character, and reliance on clunky grapple controls. After 4 hours I still haven't really got the hang of using grappling in combat.

1416,136618772.0,1811990,"As someone who's constantly looking for new deckbuilders to try out, I was really excited to check out Wildfrost's demo earlier this year. The game combined an adorable artstyle with a high difficulty where it's uncertain whether or not you'll make it one third of the way into the run. The full game did not disappoint me at all -- compared to the demo, the runs have been expanded to include 2 more acts, and there many unlockables for future playthroughs.


The game features wonderful artwork with a cartoony cel-shaded artstyle. All of the character cards have a personality to them, and I was surprised to see that some of the cards would change their appearance depending on actions you take in combat. Blood would splatter on their fronts, a monster would grow depending on how enraged it got and an ally would increase the size of the snowball in their hands after you power her up.

Added to that are various interactive UI elements that react to your actions -- bell relics swing and produce noise when you hover your mouse over them, upgrades are presented as trinkets on a keychain that you can attacks to your units. The various locations you visit also have satisfying animations for interacting with them, be it breaking a slab of ice or feeding your cards to Muncher. This makes the game really fun from an aesthetic point of view, it's simply a joy to look around the interface.


The combat itself seems to be an involved version of an autobatter: you play down unit cards, and they automatically attack targets (or use abilities) after their cooldown is complete. In addition to that, you can play skill cards to influence the battlefield yourself, applying status effects and doing direct damage to units. In between turns, you're free to move any and all of your units around the field, choosing who is going to be at the front to take damage, who can be sacrificed to the incoming heavy hit, and who should be sent back to your deck to recover some hitpoints. Other than these actions, each card you play takes exactly 1 turn to resolve, causing enemies to act immediately, even before your own units.

This causes the game to be all about reacting to the puzzle presented in front of you on each of the turns. How do you take the least amount of damage? How can you kill the most enemies in a single turn, as doing so makes them drop more loot? Can you afford to leave this character out, or should you play it safe and heal it up, resetting its attack timer and having to play it out again later?


The downside of this, is that the battlefield can get rather complex, with multiple enemies and allies triggering each other's abilities, some of which might be unclear to a new player or someone who's not in the mind to pay complete attention to the game. I have lost several runs simply because I forgot about a keyword an enemy had, causing them to hit my hero instead of the default target and losing me the game. The combat is unforgiving -- you're not given warnings or previews about the following turn, though you do get a battlelog where you can see what went wrong. One mishap that kills your hero, and you need to start over (or close the game to reset the combat if you don't mind cheating).


Once you're dead, the game will show you the progress you've made towards unlocking new content. You can get different units to add to your starter deck, which are pets in this game; you can unlock new charms to find in your runs, which represent the game's upgrades; you can also unlock new locations to visit during a run and new factions to play, which feature their own decks and playstyles. 

I'm personally not a fan of meta-progression in games, though I think the way Wildfrost does it is fairly fun. At the same time I do feel that putting some of the encounters behind an unlock barrier feels a little unsatisfying to me. Additionally, the way the game's ""hub"" is organized is that you have ~8 different buildings. After you click on one of them, the NPC inside will show you what type of unlock you can get, and what you need to do to get it. This means that if you want to see all of the challenges you need to complete, you have to keep clicking back and forth between these locations -- and they're spread out all around the screen in a scrollable scene in buildings that aren't easy (for me) to identify the purpose of at a glance.

I would love it if there was a list detailing all the quests in a single menu screen, like the one they have for achievements, and if there was a side panel using which you could switch between all of the buildings without having to scroll or look for the right one.

The game's ""ascension"" mode where you increase the difficulty of the game after completing it is also quite interesting -- you both get penalties and boosts for doing so. The first two difficulty increases make it so enemies have a chance to be upgraded (while dropping more gold) and the waves come out one turn quicker (but your starting unit is played down for free on the first turn).


Having enjoyed this game so much, it was a surprise to me just how many people found it unfun. I read the reviews stating that this is one of the worst deckbuilders around, that it has no sense of balance, that no matter how you build or upgrade your deck, you're bound to lose due to how much stronger the enemies are, that there is absolutely no variety in viable builds. Now, usually I wouldn't fanboy over a game I like just because it received harsh criticism, however, in this case it feels to me that the reviews like that are misleading.


My opinion is that the game's balance is fine. I was capable of winning my run immediately after finishing the tutorial, but I lost because of a mistake. I won my first run on my 4th attempt, and my second one on an increased difficulty on my 10th attempt. The majority of my losses were down to me not fining a solid end-game strategy by the middle of act 2, or because I didn't pay enough attention and got my hero killed. Both of these are fine in this line of games -- you're not [b]meant[/b] to win every run. Some runs are you barely scraping by with a semblance of a deck you cobbled together, while others have you farm a ton of gold with an absurd build you were given. 

The deck variety felt good. It seems to me that you can win using a variety of strategies, [b]however[/b] the game will not let you win if you put all of your eggs in one basket. You're not going to win with a ""poison deck"" because that's likely to be weak against many smaller units, or with a ""thorns deck"" because that's weak against high-hitting enemies, or with a ""heal deck"" because you can't heal if you're dead to a 40 damage attack.


The game will present challenges to you, and you need to be able to answer them appropriately -- you need to tank damage, to kill many small enemies quickly, to kill single large enemies, to put all your pieces on the board, etc. The way to do that is to know what challenges you'll be presented with, and what answers you can use against those challenges, both of which require knowing the game. Of course, sometimes you don't find the best answer, so you might have to settle for some mid option instead, but that's kind of the appeal of roguelikes to me. This mindset helped me get through all of my winning (or close-to-winning) runs, and it is what I feel many people who are dissatisfied with the game's balance are missing.",1.0
1417,136677173.0,1811990,"Want to open by saying Gaziter's art is great. I wishlisted the game because of the art so the game being really good too just makes it even better.

The game itself is an Excellent rougelike deck builder, very unique compared to the other big ones on the market. Much harder than many I've played too, which is great. 

Many of the complaints from other reviews come from not realizing that the game play is a lot more like a puzzle with a lot of moving pieces you have to solve from turn to turn, rather than more straight forward damage calculations (although those are there too). The game demands a lot more precision each turn than most other deck builders, (even Spire until you hit higher ascension levels).

You can definitely brute force some very strong combos, but the game puts a big premium on planning ahead for specific threats, and you wont get good at that until youve lost a good few runs.

Another thing I've noticed after several dozen runs is that while leaders feel weak, I've actually been getting more robust and useful ones now that I've unlocked a good bit of the meta progression. I don't know of they're set to scale up based on your unlocks or if I'm just getting more comfortable with the game so I see the value in things I dismissed before. (I suspect its a bit of both.

Lastly, some things definitely are over or under tuned. Bigfoots are pretty insane and demand an immediate answer. A few player cards could probably stand to have their numbers bumped. One thing I'd really like to see is more cards that don't use up your turn. Not too many, one to three at most. The flow of the turns is really strong as it is, but I think being able to play more than one card per turn almost doubles the decision space that turn, which is really interesting if its not every turn.",1.0

1430,136674779.0,1364020,"TL:DR; The game has the strongest foundation of its kind, the team is super professional and the game overall is a piece of art. The developers deserve way more positive credit than they're given now.


[b]Why this game is different[/b]
I've played hundreds of alpha/beta/ea/released indie shooters over the years. There is a pattern that I've noticed with most of the games that failed: The second there was creative deviation away from the status quo, these studios would immediately make bad decisions. Round-based TDM, revives in respawn gamemodes, operator lock-in in casual gamemodes, removal of jump in a fast paced shooter, gimmicks, semi fire assault rifles by default, asthma inspired stamina systems, overpowered damage-based abilities, etc.

These ideas seem to go through a studio, without any protest. No one at these studios thinks ""hey, maybe we should add a scrollbar to our in-game chat"". It erodes trust in the developers and makes me not want to invest into their game in the long term.


[b]What the game does right[/b]
Boundary innovated a ton in this game, and they didn't make any simular mistakes. The game is pretty, the UI is incredible, progression is addictive, gamemodes are fun, the animations are smooth, audio is immersive, balance is sensible, their handling of playtests was professional, settings carried over from previous playtests, suggestions are being listened to and their communication is fantastic.

The grapple and movement module are a blast, recoil of snipers boosts your speed and emps make you spin. You can pop balloons that blow you away, there are small crates floating in spawn that you can push around and use as cover and you can pressurize rooms which blow enemies away when they open its doors. Even their weirdest gimmicks work out.


[b]When it does go wrong, the team still rocks[/b]
Every developer creates bugs. There are some crashes, bugs, the lobby system has some quirks, and there is performance spikes on some maps. You could even include minor gripes like mostly static spawns. There are some grammatical errors, but if anything they're cute and the community has adopted them. (panta kill enjoyer)

The way the team handled problems is professional and reasonable (even their replies on the steam reviews here). After the rocky launch, the team kept players up to date through their discord. After some fixes, the team gave out 2 ""compensation cosmetics"" as a reward for peoples patience. When VC was broken, they quickly disabled it until it was fixed. The team has stocked up post-launch (played during the beta) content so the game isn't dead right out of the gate.


I would absolutely say that this game is worth buying. Its fun, addictive and high quality. I also feel like the good progression system and the post-launch content can keep the game relevant for long enough. The developers deserve much more respect for all the things they did right (which is most of it)",1.0
1431,136675514.0,1364020,pretty good,1.0
1432,136675546.0,1364020,"THE GOOD:
The zero G and gunplay feels fantastic, plus the audio editing, though a little choppy, REALLY works well for the intensity and immersion. the gunplay is very similar to Titanfall 2's PVP, especially in terms of movement and the TTK, which feels juuuust right to me. Especially when the matches get intense, and you're rushing and making those split second decisions, the game's truly firing on all cylinders, and one i don't feel like stopping. 

The movement is something I've never experienced before, and it just clicks with you after like 10 minutes. Actively taking engagements, feels great! But there's always the possibility to play defensive with snipers and AR's, moving in a disciplined format, cover to cover through hallways. Although camping here will simply not work, since if you're near an enemy, you'll hear a pinging sound to guide you to them, and vice versa. Long range engagements a la battlefield, is still a possibility. 

Balance wise I can't comment, but I've not experienced any unfair fights or guns so far. Everything's got a place, although i DO wish snipers and DMR's got a buff, cause DMRs are they are, are a little too weak, and downright detrimental closer than 20 metres. 

Playing as Spike (stealth CQC lady who leaves a smoke bomb like a squid to evade), just grapple-hooking, stealthing and bum-rushing with a shotgun has no business feeling as addictive as it is. 

And the visuals? Incredible.

I'm playing this from India, on southeast Asian servers, so I've encountered none of the ping issues mentioned in other reviews, and while firefights are often too overstimulating at times, they haven't felt unfair to me in the 15ish games i've played. Plus, it helps that getting a match here, at the time barely takes 5 seconds (all modes are 5v5, and variations of TDM, TDM without respawns, Capture-The-Flag, Site Control, and Bomb-planting)

THE BAD: 
A lot of the translations in the game clearly come from Google translate, like ""Magazine"" is called Ammo Storage Device, and there's little misspellings everywhere. And the updates on steam come in english, but in game they're still in chinese. 
Plus, there's no tutorials on character abilities yet, so you'll need to just trial-and-error your way to grasping them, but that's not too difficult. 

The content is obviously very narrow. Granted the game modes are immensely fun, and the map design has a LOT to give, a lot of the maps are just ""Some space complex above the earth's atmosphere"" and so while they differ in structure, there's little visual changes. 

There's quite some visual bugs, with slow-loading textures, and texture pop in every now and then. With how much detail there is to sift through anyways, this can often get annoying and make you miss enemies which can and will result in deaths that you didn't deserve. I get that it's early access, so this is probably among the more stable games, but still. 

Someone mentioned something about the anticheat reading programs accessing your RAM or something? And how they can ban you from the game if they find sus activities, but someone who understands computers better than me can speak to its quality.

TLDR: I'm deeply deeply hoping this game's able to grow and get better for players in different continents as well, cause the localization as is, is bad, but functional. Once it gets a healthy dose of more content, and longer matches, it'll go HARD. It's worth the price as it is, and there's insane potential here. I can see this becoming one of those niche favorites like Insurgency and the like one day, fingers crossed it does. 8.5/10",1.0

This is a visual novel / dating sim where you are a writer trying to make a go in Hollywood. Overall, it was a fun, hilarious experience that none-the-less seemed fairly realistic in some ways both for the writing gig stuff, the dating stuff, and the real world stuff. Definitely hits true for the writer gig a few times, rather painfully so even, at least from my limited experience. Also seems to have a good amount of elements tracked behind the scenes, which I really like - I've always kind of felt that in game stat screens for character stats and romantic interest while a commonality to most games presented a lot of surreality, so kind of liked that those things were present but secret for this game.
Honestly had some trouble coming up with cons to the game - its early access, what I'd assume is just the first episode of the game, so it is relatively short. The price tag is sadly about average for these sorts of games these days. Now, some of you may not like that there is really no sexual content that I am aware of at least, from my play through at least. Honestly, I'm fine with that; likely some in future episodes, though I don't think there needs to be a ton. A stronger story and immerisve experience makes up for any short coming there, easily.

combat - most combat are fast and wont take you more then 10m

pay to win - the game revolves around heros/operators/avatars etc.. and every one got their own weapons/stats and passive effect unlock that you can share among other heros/operators/avatars etc.. 
here is the problem
some heros/operators/avatars etc.. cost alot of money to unlock (around 20$) so if a new ones will come out and their got a broken passive buff then the payers will get a huge advantage by being able to unlock and use it first.

classes - 2 classes are almost always full as they got the best weapons and more fun(assault and sniper) while the other 2 are almost always on half or less
mainly the support class that is out right at 20% at all time from what i saw(some support class have 0 spare magazines, that kind of brake the point of cover fire that is pointless anyway because the lmg will do next to no damage to enemies that are far and if you shot a sniper he will just take your 2 points of damage and 1 shot you back)

Gameplay looks slightly smoothier than in FX3.
And I'm out of pros actually.
Most of positive reviewers will write that a lot of reviews are just complains about prices - and that is true!
But let's face things: you won't like to play only free tables and tablepass that devs give you is just a mockery, because, it don't even grant access to all tables! Some of them allow just 2 minute trial mode!
And that's why this is a review with complaining about price policy.
I don't want to pay MORE for EXACT SAME tables that are present in FX3 (majority of which I bought during Xmas sale in 2022) and I can't recommend to do this to anyone, unless you have irresistible desire to spend your money ""just because"". The legacy bundles costs just unfair in my opinion. Again, I compared Ghost Rider table in FX and in FX3 and it feels just the same - maybe, just maybe, Williams tables worth to pay again for them. I just wasn't prepared that tablepass will be  activated instantly upon receiving and I can't play a lot during workday.
Also, would be nice to highlight that the prices on tables in ewwwwwwgs is lower that in Steam (after a year of being an exclusive) which is also embarrassing.

And so, in the end, we have nice update of the platform, which works fine on portable devices. More smooth gameplay. But without tables - it just lose sense to jump in this version, especially, if you have plenty of great table owned in FX3. I think, you won't miss a thing.",0.0

As a veteran to the roguelike genre, this game is definitely more tricky than the usual roguelike I have played, however, it's definitely a game you can consistently do well in. On my first run alone, I made it pass the second boss. Now, I have beaten the true final boss in only 8 hours of playing with 10 total runs played. What I've learned is that healing is notoriously a tried and tested strategy to guarantee you will make it far. But you should also focus on doing 4 things: racking up money (usually from combo kills and money event space) so that you can buy crowns to set up your forces and combos asap, taking events in this priority order - Money/Shop>Helper(if it isnt capped)>Card removal>Relic>Chest (card reward), focus on 1 type of synergy for your deck that corresponds to your clan, and do not take any cards with side effect with them. If you take these things into account, you'll make it far even if you make a mistake or didn't plan well.

What you need to do is switch between two scenes, find items and use them at the right spot. Scenes are very tiny and usually have one or two items and some piece of furniture that can be opened. 

Red herrings that reset the entire puzzle make the puzzles a little trickier. These can take the form of a puppy that jumps out when the door is opened, an electric outlet that shocks you, and even a ghost lady looking out of a well.

Certain situations are incredibly intriguing and unexpected. Although some scenarios are repeated, each problem contains enough fresh material to keep you from ever feeling as though you have seen it before.

1492,136645653.0,1811990,"I don't typically take the time to review a game. I think this is one of those very rare occasions when I should.

I got this game because I love deck builder games. Slay the Spire MTG you know what I mean. This game starts out so easy to learn, so fun and wholesome. The music and graphics are fun and upbeat. I even had an absolute blast playing it while I did. 

16 play hours later and over 70 straight losses and I cannot help but wonder if there is a code to counter your deck in particular instances to increase the length of the game and if that bugged out on some of us because there cannot possibly be a perfect counter every single run.

Others have mentioned it, you build a deck type and you WILL face the direct counter to it. Now you may think, ""I can just overcome the counter, right?"" Your hope of beating the decks that have literally been designed to destroy you is 0. My best attempt against a hard counter got me a through a wave and a half. Not even close. This has happened over 70 times. 

You might think I just have trouble with hard games. Well for reference I loved and fully beat Bloodborne, Darkest Dungeon, Demon Souls, Enter the Gungeon among others. Those are punishing games and I adored them.

People complaining about the difficulty are being absurd. It´s what actually makes this game fun! The choices you make, the paths you take, the cards you upgrade, what you play, how you position your troops, it ALL IS VITAL and will change the outcome of your run! 

People want games with meaningful choices and strategy but once they make bad decisions, they call it too difficult. 
80% of my runs have failed because I made a dumb decision and the game punished me for it. This makes it super fun, though. With every run I´ve unlocked new things, keeping the content fresh! And with every dumb choice I make, I learn from my mistakes and get further in the next attempt.

The tribes you can play are incredibly varied and play very differently. 
Heroes, companions, charms and cards with a dozen varying effects make combos and strategies super fun and somewhat unique every run.
The progressive unlocking of cards, charms (card upgrades), companions keeps the incentive to re-run interesting and high.

My only complaint is that some effects are somewhat unclear and require testing to understand. A few of my runs were ruined by this issue. Part of the learning process but it would also just be easier if it was specified how certain effects affect results. Same thing with not being able to see if you´ve reached your companion limit. Other than that, all groovy!

I can only recommend!!!",1.0
1499,136735539.0,1811990,"After playing this game for 15 hours I feel I can give my honest opinion on it. This game reminds me a lot of Slay the Spire and The Darkest Dungeon, with how strategic you need to be and with some level of RNG that's involved. However, I will say this game looks and feels quite polished compared to the two, as it feels more fluid. The art style is quite nice to look at and the story/characters you come along as interesting as a whole. However, if I had one thing to say about this game to sum it up, it's that it's very very difficult. It took me a good few hours just to figure out a few mechanics that aren’t told to you, and the learning curve is very steep for new players. I'm not a god at the game but if you take your time to figure out different combinations and paths you can take it's very rewarding. I would say that perhaps it is too harsh for newcomers to this type of game and the beginning can be more forgiving, however other than that I do enjoy this quite a bit, and I do believe everyone should give it a try at least once.

The physics are so good that I drain about as fast as I do on the real machines... and that's not a bad thing!

In its current state, the game could use some optimization on some lesser hardware and there is a strange issue where there is occasional input lag that can be quite frustrating, but it's not common enough to be a deal breaker and somethign that should probably be ironed out in future patches.

The only feature that feels sorely missing is VR support. Anybody who has ever experienced pinball in VR is probably aware that it's a bummer going back to a flat screen where you just never get the perfect camera angle versus feeling like you are actually standing at a real 3D machine using your head naturally as the camera. If this feature isn't added by the developers, there is at least an upcoming mod being worked on that will make VR possible soon.

however as much as i enjoy this game, their remains a problem of players using wall hacks, not to shoot through walls or anything but to know your position some may disagree with this, but having witnessed it in multiple matches it is their, and some people are using it, as to which it get's to a point of this just isn't fun, so i enjoy this but find myself being put off playing it with the fact that in 6 hours of play i have encountered around 4-5 people using said cheats, 
that is the only con to this game,

the playerbase are all really friendly and get along except for the ones who forget to unmute all of us have done it at least once XD.

the gunplay is nice and smooth the movement and all is good, they also have a shooting range available at the menu where you select what you wish to do just turn left, their is also a pre-lobby between matches with basketball, a bar, and just a place to interact with teammates and the opposition.

 £25 was a steep jump in price for what is currently their but as they add to the game the price would 100% be worth it, provided they start dealing with these cheaters, permanent bans would be the way showing them if they wish to cheat they have to purchase it again on a new account, i do recommend the game if you dont mind running into those sorts of people occasionally, but if that sorta thing really get's to you i'd avoid at that point, this is just my opinion",1.0

1547,136741934.0,1811990,"The game really doesn't feel fair to play.

I have a LOT of hours into Slay the Spire, Roguebook, and many other card games. It is entirely unbalanced, there's basically no point in withdrawing cards into the pouch to heal them, as there's zero chance you'll still be alive by the time you can use them again.

Your start is entirely random, and you will outright lose almost every game based on the selection of leaders and misc crap you are then given.

In something like Slay the Spire, Roguebook, or Monster Train, if you lose MOST of the time it is due to a misplay, or not following through on a strategy. Occasionally or rarely it is due to bad luck. In this game, there's no way to (consistently) heal your character, and you get one of three choices of leaders, all of which are usually bad in my experience, they either do no damage, have aimless (which will mean when they DO attack they attack at random), or are just mediocre. If your leader dies the run ends. Enemies have very high HP, you will get to pick between 1-2 cards generally between fights, every fight has a boss, and depending on the RNG of what you draw at the start, you can lose pretty much from the get-go.

For example, I get no snowballs (the only way to delay enemy turns), no allies, and am fighting the monkey boss. One of the minor enemy monkeys has 8 hp, attacks every round, and gains 1 damage every round starting from zero. The problem? In my case it takes 4 turns for my character to attack for 4 damage, they have like 9 hp, in that timespan the monkey has hit me for 6 damage, and if I had no attack cards it is only at half hp, while i am down to 3 hp, with no consistent way to heal.

Keep in mind there'll be another like 5 enemies that will spawn in during that time, and on the round I can attack, I'll be attacked by the boss, the monkey that is much stronger than the boss, and all the other misc. enemies.",0.0

1574,136740635.0,1651560,"So far the game has a strange hold on my brain. I love it. Its cutesy art style and relaxed approach to gameplay are refreshing. Its missing a lot of content right now, but that's only because its in Early Access, but what's here is currently very good. For someone who plays a lot of city builders, and played this game's demo extensively, there's a few hours of content. For a more casual audience I'd say there's easily double what I got.",1.0
1575,136740497.0,1651560,"Cute is an understatement for this game. It still lacks features and content but thats somewhat okay i guess, since it's early access. It was fun playing this though and i have high hopes regarding the further development and the roadmap. Please don't disappoint me. Unpolished gem right now. Perfect for winding down though.",1.0
1576,136740118.0,1651560,"There's a great foundation which also uses (foundation's) territorial system here but some stuff is lacking per say , pacing is tacky and some stuff is just weird.

Pro's - Unique systems and charming laid back art direction its super charming + relaxing. There's lots of potential here (hopefully it delivers)

Con's - pacing is tacky - to put it mildly  the concept is there for food and gold etc. which are kinda basic , but the timing and cost of it encourages a super slow play style which might not be for everyone.

Desirability - buildings have upkeep and certain heavier industries give or reduce desirability/beauty of a certain spot. Having high desirability increases happiness of the housing in the area- leading to a faster immigration rate i think at least) but really don't affect anything besides that so far.

Cost- The cost of buildings lends to its slow play style , buildings are pricey at the start and taxes are fixed, ie the initial farm of vegetables cost you 225 gold for the max of 40 fields, a single homestead for 3 peasants (2 workers) costs about 55 gold , with a ratio of 2-3 peasant houses giving enough cash to reach double digits + support the upkeep of one building that needs it.


Food- It aint fully there yet, (fish comes in the future updates it says) + each food type gives its own number of food needs fulfilled . I.e wheat requires 2 processes to become bread - but has about double the food fulfillment compared to vegetables which don't need any processes to be used. The main problem is the ratio of the wheat products - you need 2 or 3 wheat units for one unit of flour, but 4 flour for 1 unit of bread, or just 4 units of wheat for pork (requiring a herd), this means essentially a super high scaling cost of a 1000 or more to get it to a stable supply for the next tier of citizens .

1578,136739618.0,1651560,"So I was looking for a new city sim kind of game, you know something to pass a little time and loose myself in. Now what we need to remember is this is a game that is in early access but that being said.... I sank 6 hours into this no problem. There is understandably quite a bit locked in game at the moment. Honestly though this runs super smooth, is peaceful and the mechanics aren't too hard to understand if you have played this type of game before. Yes the animations may seem a little ""childish"" but for me this added a lot to the charm of the game. A solid game and can't wait to see what else they do to it. 
Would highly recommend for anyone that loves this style of game.",1.0

The characters are all unique and super fun to play, and the gameplay is smooth as butter. I can already tell I'm gonna sink hours into trying to beat all the bosses and unlocking everything. Plus, the devs have already laid out their plans for upcoming content, so we can expect even more cool stuff by the summer!",1.0
1580,136742889.0,1183800,"So far a very nice game with a lot of tactical depth, there are somethings that I think could be improved:

1. Actions like venting, overwatch etc. that all characters share should always be on the same button, so it becomes more intuitive to do the right action without checking the UI
2. Its almost impossible to tell how far an enemy could be walking and whether or not he could be in range to attack your characters on the next turn, would be good if you could see their walking/attack range when hovering or selecting enemies
3. Would be nice to have a UI scaling setting, so that texts are a bit easier to read on bigger screens
4. Like others already mentioned, having some way of deciding the walking path (or automatic routing around dangers) would be helpful

I will let you know if I find anything else :)",1.0
1581,136740332.0,1968710,"This game is very fun, it is basically ultrakill and cluster truck combined into one game. The sound track is really good and there is a lot of potential to replay the game by doing speed runs (leader-boards open on April 27th) and doing different difficulties or if you really want to just use the kick. Overall I think the price tag is a good spot at the games current state. The campaign is not that long currently but I believe the devs said they would extend it. There are a few minor bugs but nothing game changing. Overall I would recommend this game to almost everyone, it is a fun fast paced shooter that combines ultrakill and cluster truck into one great game.",1.0

1588,136739782.0,2380240,"Overall a short boring walking simulator, barely any horror in the game at all. Got stuck at a point where I had to shoot on a solid door that apparently was one way-glass with a really small ""fragile"" text in the bottom of it. Before that I walked back and forth trying to figure out if it was some kind of puzzle element with the 2 switches in the game which you could turn on and off, the only thing that did was confuse me making me believe one had to be turned on and the other off to progress.

When I played the game I was forced to join the discord and type a stupid command to get a code if i wanted to progress in the game. This has apparently been fixed now in a recent patch which is a good thing.
There is nothing chasing you 97% of the game, the only ""chase"" sequence is in the end in a maze which lasts about 1 minute.
I would say the graphics, sound and lighting are the only good things with this game and the fact that it is free. 
The developers have another game upcoming based on this so I would like to assume this is a kind of demo of the upcoming game but if that is the case I think it should be stated on the store page which gives you less expectations of an actual game.",0.0

this game is incredible. if Slay the Spire is deckbuilder Dark Souls, Wildfrost is Sekiro. Come in thinking you can dodge roll to victory and you'll get wrecked.

It's very difficult and mistakes are punishing but in my opinion this is a big part of what makes it so addictive!  It's crazy to me that anyone would leave a negative review as clearly a ton of thought and effort went into this game. Aside from a couple bugs I've encountered (mostly related to the smackback mechanic?) it is a great time, and I'm sure even those issues will be ironed out shortly.  Highly recommended!

I played WOW regularly for 17 years - yes 17 years and finally got so used to it it started becoming boring so is why I was looking for something to take it's place and this game is it.  Give it a solid try and I think you will see the fun and enjoyment from it.  It's not a first shooter by any means which personally I don't care for anyway it's kinda layed back and peaceful.

The gun play, audio and graphics are amazing and so long updates are release this game is 100% worth it. If you are sceptical then i would advise waiting for several months for the state of the game as it exits early access but from what i can see the future of the game looks promising.

Played the Demo of Boundary a few months back, and i was highly impressed, on how good the game worked in this early phase. I barely never played any Early Access game, which felt more finished, like this one. Sure, it definitely needs more ""maps"", more guns, more astronauts, but performace wise, it's already in a really good condition. If you like shooters, but you are on the search for something new, give it a try.

The game is amazing, gunplay is very fun and the mechanics are very cool, definitely something that i see myself playing a lot.

1622,136743147.0,1649740,"Hunt the Night is a souls inspired 2D action RPG with some platforming and shooting elements. It is a relatively short game that can be beaten in around 10 hours but can be further extended if you are going for 100% or new game+. below are some short pros and cons for the game.

PROS:
- The controls are responsive and dodge timings are tight but intuitive.
- The shifting between melee and gun combat is pretty nice and the ammo system is not to punishing
- Aside from 1 boss [spoiler] mother [/spoiler], I find them to be fun, have good auditory and visual cues, and have amazing designs.
- The enemy scaling is pretty good, you can beat the game with the starting equipment on a first playthrough.
- I know people are pretty mixed on this, but I really liked the puzzles as it doesn't hand hold you and 1 of them was down right cryptic.
CONS:
- I find most of the mechanics underdeveloped, I never use grenades as they are too clunky and deal little to no damage; the crossbow is inferior to the pistol and shotgun; and poison and burn don't deal enough damage or proc enough to warrant a build dedicated to them.
- Exploration is a pain in the ass. You don't have map or a collectible checklist, and a good portion of the early game is a swamp that needed a special unlock to traverse through.
- Story is pretty mediocre; I wasn't really invested, and the lore is pretty much all over the place.
- Music is okay, I wasn't impressed nor disappointed.
- Some bounty bosses are buggy; I bum rushed 2 of them and they died getting stun-locked by sword slashes.

Overall, I find the game enjoyable, albeit unpolished for the most part. If you are looking for a short game to binge through, but still want a decent challenge, then I highly recommend playing this game.",1.0

1628,136743514.0,1183800,"An absolute blast. If you're familiar with XCOM - which I assume you are if you're looking at this game - you'll feel right at home with the core combat. Where it differs is that in this game, I feel so much more agency when it comes to how my unit hit. There are several ways to improve your hit chances and make it much more likely that you'll connect, to the point where I almost never worry about taking a shot unless I'm basically certain it'll connect. Variability comes with damage, enemy armor, and use of cover and clever tactics. There's also a resource management element where you need to collect loot as you fight and flee, so that you can heal or upgrade in between fights. The core loop is just perfect. It also has a nice aesthetic, and an intriguing world. The narrative does seem simplistic, but it's a good enough framing device to get you in the action.

If you've played the original 20 years ago, it'll send you on a trip down memory lane like smelling an old candle you used to love as a kid. At this time of the review i'm done with one of the 10 games and here are some notable change worth mentioning:

- Gameplay is just as smooth as the original, it's a great port on that regard
- Art Gallery, Music Player, they're fine whatever, you'll spend 5 mins in there and be over it. Mostly nice to see once.

Game Buster Max breaks the game. It takes away every challenge. Which if you're a veteran and simply want to speed through the game I guess is fine, also if you want to speed up grinding for chip collection, but I find myself with the Batman corollary as in, if i use it now, why not use it all the time? And well, it kills every enemies in less than seconds can count on your end battle report card. If it's your first time playing the game, please don't turn on this feature, it takes away a lot of how amazing the battle system in this franchise is. 

Beyond that, it's the same as the games on Gameboy Advance, except now you get access to the rare chips from the start and there's achievements to accomplish which adds flavor. 

I haven't tried trading or PvP, frankly said I usually stay away from such features in all my game, but i appreciate the inclusion for those who may enjoy it more than I do. A very fun game worth the full collection price if you care to support the franchise.",1.0

So having played in the open alpha and beta play tests, and now owning the game since release. I would say it's a pretty decent game as it stands and I do recommend getting it for yourself. (At the time of writing this the game has only been out for barely two days and more updates are to come so keep this in mind.)

Here's a couple of things I've noticed since launch.

[b]1.) Spacial Audio Issues [/b]
Now since the play tests to the now fully released game, I will admit the audio has gotten loads better. But there is definitely still some issues when it comes to hearing your team members foot steps much easier than the enemy's foot steps, even when they're almost right next to you. The audio for team and enemy foot steps should either be the same volume, or switched.

[b]2.) Where'd the Compass go? [/b]
There was a compass that used to be attached to your wrist making it easier for you to communicate with your team mates as to which direction to enter the building from (attacking), or say where they're entering from (defending). I haven't fully gone through the settings again to see if they've made it so you can toggle it on your wrist or not yet so this might change.

[b]3.) No Tutorial for New Players [/b]
At this current moment in time the only way for someone to learn the game is ""trial by fire"" in a sense. They're basically having to rely on team members to understand the game mechanics and how they work. Even something like tool tips would be helpful, and maybe just adding a toggle in the settings to disable them.

[b]4.) Gun Play [/b]
The gun play is actually quite nice for a newer VR Tact-Shooter, and it's quite refreshing if I'm being honest. It's very rewarding for hitting head shots. So for all the VR shooter head hunters out there, you'll have a great time with this game.

[b]5.) The Community [/b]
The community is absolutely amazing. Obviously you're going to run into kids being this game is on both PCVR and Quest. But when you're in the right lobby, it could be the highlight of your day (or the absolute rock bottom depending on which side you got).


[h2]T.L.D.R. [/h2]

With Breachers only having been released for two days, for what it is I couldn't recommend it more right now. It is honestly enjoyable (all be it with the issues it has). As stated prior the community is great, the developers are working hard on updating the game while talking with the community and getting their input as to what people want/like the most about the game.

The second issue is that the game is random about what cards it gives you, but there aren't enough to pick from or maybe just enough in general because trying to build to apply a specific status or do a specific thing is almost impossible and many of the quests require you to do so in order to complete them.

1712,136753374.0,307950,"I have played Caliber since August 2022 prior to the Steam launch.

Great game overall for being F2P, good PVE/PVP 3rd person gameplay if you're looking for something that is similar to Ghost Recon Phantoms (RIP) or the old SOCOM games. 
Continuous regular updates for bugfixes/balancing and good communication with the Caliber team on discord.
Wasn't expecting much from it when I first started as it just seemed like one of those lower budget random foreign games but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of it (graphics are good, lots of different mechanics, somewhat authentic operator designs from multiple different countries that you can tell the devs researched with some effort, etc). 

As it is F2P, has a lot of monetization stuff to make your progress a lot quicker, which is annoying but expected of course. It is ""pay for convenience"" but not ""pay to win"".

Pros:
- Graphics and character designs are pretty good.
- Gameplay variety (has PVE, PVPVE, PVP and limited special gamemodes)
- PVE isn't super easy even on lowest difficulty (you will die if you aren't paying attention or taking cover)
- Large variety of different operators with different abilities, you have to level up operators by playing them to improve their abilities and make them more viable. Different operators have different play-styles and strategy.
- Good communication with Caliber team (I personally saw a design error on an operator skin with an upside down NVG mount, brought it up on Discord with a screenshot, and the design was fixed within an update or two).
- Very fun when playing as team and actually communicating. Bring your friends. Sometimes sucks though if solo-queuing and your team has braindeads/leavers or doesn't communicate at all.

Cons:
- A lot of monetization that reduces your grinding. It is expected as game is F2P, but some of the real money prices for certain things are super high, such as $10-20 USD for a new operator to play (there are currently 68 operators, some are more expensive than others). You can grind for ingame credits by winning and doing challenges but it will probably take a couple days to grind out enough to buy one operator. I believe when you start out and do all the tutorials and stuff you have enough for a few operators to start out with though. Try them out at the Firing Range before you decide on what to buy / play as for awhile if you aren't going to drop real cash on the game.
- Often has toxic players in PVP who get mad and quit if you lose a round (annoying, as this game is 4v4 you will be at a significant disadvantage).
- High ping if you aren't in Russia. I believe this is less of a problem now as they have added back in US and EU servers.
- Some balancing issues with operators.
- Battlepass system is weird. Very expensive, comes in multiple different parts that are paid for separately, takes awhile to level, and the operators obtained from the end of the battlepass are unobtainable once the battlepass ends for a long while (months), in which they finally open up to being purchased by real money or credits.

1726,136754742.0,2328760,"Pinball FX is a great game that builds on previous iterations. Some of the 
biggest improvements you will notice are in the physics department and with the graphics 
and lighting. I am a seasoned digital pinball player and can tell you this is by far the closest
this game has come to having realistic physics. For me, the physics are what really sold
me on this title and I have played it since its first release on the Epic Games Store.
When you play digital pinball games, realistic physics can go a long way because 
it challenges you to make good shots and rewards you when you do but also punishes
you when you don't. In FX3, for example, the physics felt like the ball had a predetermined path
(especially on the Zen tables) which is why I played the Williams titles for the majority of my playtime.
That is not the case with Pinball FX and because of the physics overhaul, I am finding myself enjoying
titles from FX3 that I didn't have much interest in before. 
The second biggest improvement is the lighting and animations that you will notice while you are playing.
The Williams tables received a glow update that improved lighting specifically around the flashers which was
very noticeable.

If you are coming from FX3, the physics will feel a lot different at first and it will take getting used to because
it's a different engine but you will notice how much more ""realistic"" they feel the more you play.
Lastly, the amount of tables Pinball FX offers is actually quite insane. There is something for everyone. For old
timers like myself, I enjoy playing the Williams recreations the most but because of the renewed physics,
I am also enjoying original titles like Crypt of the Necrodancer a lot.

It's also a story about love and expectations while also murdering monsters and helping save the kingdoms across the land.  Avoiding spoilers I remember it having a decent story although some NPCs were... annoying but that's to be expected.  The music is also a bit different than what you'd expect for a fantasy rpg but it is good, the enemies challenging enough without being cheap, and the boss designs can get very much out there but in a good/unnerving way.

Compared to other RPGs there's some QoL features like visible displays to see where hidden treasure is lying (although treasure chests can be hard to spot behind some object) and now there's an optional guide system.  Alchemic item/gear crafting is pretty straightforward and not too material demanding although some drops may be hard to come by.

1771,136756710.0,1811990,"Wildfrost is a near 10/10 rogueLIKE deckbuilder with fantastic visuals, a gloriously catchy battle theme (especially in the first area) and meaningful/impactful decisions that drastically affect how you perform in your run.

Addressing many of the negative reviews (its okay to genuinely not like the game of course) which state how absurdly difficult the combat and balancing is:
The the combat plays a bit like Slay the Spire but the few battles and heavy inter/intra-battle decision making is much more akin to something like Monster Train; If you make one or two big mistakes you WILL be punished rather hard. But the opposite is also true. Big combo plays and making an almost degenerative deck can have you crushing through monsters with relative ease.

Yes the game can be brutal. Yes the leaders aren't super consistent with choice at the beginning of the run. Building a deck, deciding if you needs charms or crowns, deciding if your starter cards should be munched....these are all things to consider while looking at your cards special abilities and those of the enemy. So for all those struggling, let me give a few tips that may help you engage with the game a little better, rather than just write it off as ""bad hard game.""

1. If you can safely go for combo kills, do it. That little bit of money adds up, especially if you want to blow it all on the charm vending machine.

2. To meta progress, hit escape at find the achievements menu. Try and clear these to unlock various cards, charms and events.

3. You can and should be moving your cards around in battle as direct responses to the battle situation every single turn. With this in mind, if the battle is almost over, use this chance to recall some of your more damaged companions so they will not incur the ""injury"" debuff for next round. Also, your leader always full heals after every battle. Use this knowledge wisely to tank hits. Essentially, you want to be winning each battle as closely as possible to leader death. 

4. Save your charms until right before a battle. You may find another card later on that synergizes with the charm better. Or you may pick a card to work with a powerful charm.

5. READ. THE. DANG. CARDS. Tooltips are there for a reason. Right click on cards to see more stats so you may better plan.

6. Go slow, have fun. No need to rush, take your time and plan out moves.",1.0

1785,136755971.0,1527950,"First thing I want to say is that the game isn't awful, but it isn't great currently either. My reasons are that the story isn't really a story it doesn't feel like, they seem more like side quests to which you can choose to either help one side or the other. During these ""story missions"" you can kind of just go around the map and find them at locations which to me isn't too great, the reason being you don't get much backstory into the factions I am only on second story line but so far i haven't found a faction or group i really care about. The other thing from what I can tell (not tried but seems like can do this) is you never get locked in to helping a faction so i could do all the other factions quests for one side but get to the end back-stab the group I have been helping and others will think I am a hero.

Second is that the world is vast but very limited. I have travailed around and generally speaking all I can do is craft, kill, hunt (same as killing though), steal (which seems kind of pointless), explore few dungeons or bandit camps and do quests given at towns which are generally same as stuff listed above. 

Some ideas for more to do could be that like maybe getting your own town or village or castle to which you can have mercs with their own party limit (garrison) which could maybe go out and do assignments or just store your loot and you need to improve the structure there and that could get attacked. 

Maybe like a sandbox mode where you could actually be hired by a lord or group in wars against the other territories basically like a TRPG mountain blade get own territory or help lords take more and maybe raiding. 

More dungeons for sure from what I can tell is 1 dungeon area per location.

More character interaction like randomly generated backstories or interactions beyond the 3 choice interaction already have. I have fair few members and I know none of their names they die I don't really care just off to the town for another.

That's just some ideas bit stumped at what else could be added honestly but I just feel needs to be more variety or a more engaging story.

Combat in the game is alright I have had a few lag moments at start of playing or reloading in but nothing major. Combat can be fairly tactical but it is mostly thinking who is going first seeing what roles they have and dealing with ones you hate the most. If you play adaptive mode though the one where everything scales as you do then you need to think about everything every fight is just brutal. Got a farmer with his pitchfork and rags, you got heavy armour big shield and sharp stabby sword well ... that pitchfork was forged in dragon fire baby and it going to just pierce right through. 

The other mode though where they level per area is much easier so I would play that honestly I restarted my whole campaign because the other mode was just brutal, it got to the point where I was either losing a person every fight or near death. Clearing out a strong bandit camp just seemed like was impossible because they always have equal or more troops due to reinforcement and same or higher stats.

When comes to food, money and happiness I never had a problem honestly my party currently is 2 ponies and 10 people and i haven't struggled once with any of it to give an idea i still have 10D worth of food and 1.5k Krowns. Generally all you want is money get money buy food buy salt cook food feed them pay them and they happy to murder whoever.

That's my overview I am going to play the game to completion I don't think the game is like the worst thing to ever be made but it does feel like it drags on and is limited to what you can do I think it can become something really good it just needs more stuff to do, more engagement and fleshed out lore and backstories of places and people and a better story really but that could be too late to work on now so perhaps the other areas.

Score 5/10 currently good but needs more

1789,136757491.0,2328760,"First off, let me start by saying that I adored zen releases in the past, (mainly fx3, the deals they offered on bundles, ease of use and incredibly smooth gameplay) and ended up buying 99/100 tables, though I know there are more from lost licenses I was very pleased with the amount I spent. I never found Indiana Jones to be worth 3x the other tables, so I didnt purchase it. Then we get the announcement that a new, remastered game was coming in hot from Zen studios named Pinball FX that would be exclusive to Epic games for exactly 1 year. Here is where things started to go sour, with no option to move any tables or receive any vouchers from Zen to make the transition seamless. While I understood this gesture, I didnt understand why that also came with an awful version of the game, on Epic. Nearly unplayable. I accepted this and simply moved back to fx3, which I did not mind as I already had quite the collection of games to keep me busy.  Moving forward 1 year, we get the Steam release and to my incredible surprise, the game plays quite flawlessly albeit missing a native resolution (3840x1080, which worked flawlessly in fx3. 2560x1080 is the resolution I use in the meantime, which gives pretty significant black bars on both sides of the screen, and a slight downgrade on the resolution that shows a bit of jaggedness, no matter, the game still plays great). The game also now comes with an integrated orientation swapping setting, which is awesome and actually works on my screen, nearly looks like a full size pinball machine. So after exhausting my 1 day of free pinball pass, which is also a nice gesture, I looked to see if there were any options to swap my fx3 tables to no avail. Again, new engine, physics, graphics, which are all great, so I really dont mind paying for the tables I dont own on fx3 already,  HOWEVER, while this new version of the game is an incredibly well done version of what we have come to love over the years in fx3, I feel like it is pretty scummy to expect any sort of payment for tables that people own on your ""abandoned"" platform, fx3, in your new game, pinball FX. The people who would end up continuing to support your game into the future, are the same ones you are looking right in the eye and saying ""pay again"". No thanks. Great game, great remaster, awesome tables, scummy, SCUMMY tactics. I wont be recommending this game to anyone until they find a way to shake the hand of those who have supported their previous iterations for so long.

The amount of Characters, Weapons, and Upgrades, will surely make you plan your meta first! You don't just go on in and shooty-shoot. Even in the beginning of your playthrough, there is a per-level upgrade choices and Shop that you can pick and access so that you can strategize your gameplan or your chosen meta.

You start of in a level select, weird with no introduction, but alright. I hit new game and got brought instantly in the game, graphics are fine but have this weird effect on them.
It felt pretty good moving around, most objects could be picked up and there was text showing me exactly what to do, or at least trying to tell me. The text showing where the eviction notice was was fine for the first level or two, but after that i felt it was fairly annoying seeing all the time. There could have been an option for it, but as said earlier, the graphics had a weird effect on them, and text was hard to read.

It was alright going through at first, but there was little to no variation, go and pick up the poem (optional) and then throw the eviction notice off. It quickly became bland and boring, as the map was only changing a bit.

The audio was meh at best. ""with stunning visuals and lifelike sound effects that fully immerse the players in the experience."" The only audio that i vividly remember is the music that just cuts off if you're in a level for too long. No variation in the audio either. Not even a sound effect for picking up a poem or throwing the eviction notice off.

The graphics as told earlier had a weird effect, but were fine. Immersive enough, but not better than anything like Boneworks, Pavlov or H3VR. Looking down though, you see a very undetailed ""map"" of the construction people? If you fall down, then it renders with better quality, but you're not falling down all the time.

Controls were fine, grabbing onto most things is more than a few games can say. I was confused though when grabbing the handle of a drawer grabbed the entire drawer. You grab onto the entire model instead of just bits of it, which was unfortunate and sad. Also wish they had more things, triggers didn't even do anything other than just twitch the index finger.

There was a bug apparent too, hands getting stuck in things was not fun. You just get stuck there and have to twitch yourself a lot to fix it. Also, in a level, you started just by falling to the bottom of a container. I'm usually fine to falling, but not when its unexpected, nothing from stopping me from playing, but pretty bad for others if they can't expect it.

Those were my main gripes about the game, but why include achievements if you're only going to have one that's given from starting up the game?

I think this type of movement could be better utilised in a climbing game, or something of the sort. I would be more fine with most of these things if it was free, because free things don't usually expect quality, but having to pay, even if it's a low price is setting the standard higher. I think a few patches could maybe fix up some of these complaints though, but the game in its current form, is more bad than good.",0.0
1827,136761203.0,1498040,"Пример того, как можно взять хорошую идею и сделать ее еще лучше.

Био-прототип - это клон vampire survivors (на самом деле, бротато, но пофиг), где все способности и предметы сделаны в виде внутренних органов, которые отращивает наш мутант.

Органы делятся на две группы, ""рабочие"", которые что-то делают, и ""соединительные"", которые выступают в качестве перемычек между рабочими и активируют орган при определенном условии.  Еще органы бывают разных типов - например, щупальца стреляют, конечности наносят урон в ближнем бою, детеныши плодятся, позвоночник активирует следующий за ним орган, а глаз - активирует следующий орган, если предыдущий нанес урон противнику. Из этого всего, как из конструктора, нужно собирать организм своего мутанта, причем органы лепятся друг к другу не просто так, а по определенным правилам.

В качестве корня выступает мозг, к нему можно приделать, например, позвоночник, который будет что-то активировать раз в несколько секунд. Добавим щупальце - будем стрелять пульками. Прилепим к щупальцу нерв, а к нерву коготь - и каждая пулька при попадании будет бить когтем вокруг себя.
Можно сделать хитрее: к позвоночнику приделаем детенышей, детенышам дадим кишечник и мешочек с ядом - и теперь они будут создавать лужи ядовитой жидкости. А во второй слот поставим им еще один позвоночник, к нему щупальце стреляющее по спирали, на щупальце повесим глаз, а к глазу - паутинную железу, которая выпускает паутинку в детеныша и наносит урон всем кто с ней столкнется - теперь каждый детеныш будет выпускать по несколько пулек, которые будут летать по спирали и резать паутиной всех, кто окажется между ними и детенышем.

Сначала эти крылья, ноги и хвосты вызывают головную боль, но стоит лишь немного разобраться - и из очередного  horde survival игра превращается в развлечение ""собери мутанта с самыми безумными механиками"".

1828,136761840.0,1811990,"I have beaten the game once and here are my thoughts.

Now first off is Wildfrost a good game?

Very. It is quite fun and really makes you think.

Is the balance flawed?

Very.

Some builds simply do not work and in most instances even if you are going for a build that can work you are reliant on specific units (in my case spice flag and the weaken damage charm I likely could have won without any of the other buffs on Mika but without being able to increase her combo reliably and maintain spice I would have had no win condition viable with what was given to me.) Often you just do not get the pieces you need to make a build work. For example say you get a unit in the shadow tribe that doubles afterburn.

Cool I'll do an afterburn build.

Sometimes you won't get any afterburn applying cards.

2 x 0 = 0

This happens a lot in this game, and there is little means to manage it.

You can win and skill is important there are no per say FREE wins here but sometimes if the game isn't giving you the pieces you need you just kinda lose.

You may think you can reroll or skip cards.

None of that no you get 3 good luck fucker.

There aren't even many chances to take cards in the first place, you get around 6 before the first boss and if you don't have a good basis for your build by the time ya reach the area after that boss you are unlikley to survive.

There are also times the game can feel overwhelming with like up to 10 counters on screen and units to move around. It can often feel like a bunch of spinning plates even with a decent playable build.

In other games you can make a couple mistakes and still one, but in Wildfrost one missed position or one forgotten enemy who attacked one turn sooner than you planned for is a run ender.

The game is more overwhelming and has less wiggle room than anything else.

This isn't without pros it really makes you think which is great but it can be frustrating.

Not to hammer home the comparison but if I misplay once in Slay The Spire I can still recover, there is risk reward and one bad roll on that risk or one unblocked attack is not the end of a run granted it does punish you.

Here that one misplay does end a run and this can be frustrating especially when you simply didn't get the combo pieces you needed.

Some builds I feel are underpowered are sacrifice builds for the shadow tribe and shell/healing builds.

For sacrifice builds you need multiple specific card or a main hero that can summon (which btw heroes are rng so good luck with that) otherwise it doesn't work even when t does it ramps up far to slowly to be useful often needing 2 cards played to do one thing even with some decent synergies.

Healing and shell aka armor don't work cause means to apply healing or armor are to slow and in a game where enemies can in some cases one hit you they are not very helpful.

There are cases they can work but the scaling on them is VERY slow and dependent on getting very particular cards, in addition most healing cards have low max hp so one would assume that you could mix the two to cover that but most shield applying cards deal damage or lower your max hp so that's some pretty hard anti synergy.

How am I gonna use a healer with 4 max hp when most enemies have 6+ attack?

And they heal two?

See above point.

The real issue in my opinion is how punishing the game is compared to others and how dependent you can be on card rng in particular when you have so few chances to try to get other cards every draw really counts.",1.0

I am glad that I did. Only played it for 9 hours so far, beat the game only once. So its not easy and sometimes you get surprised by how abilities interact, but you die and you learn. So this is not an easy game, but dang its fun. There are many different ways you can go about finding a win condition and so far few runs looked similar (You have to make work what you get and the choices didnt feel forced, but I dont know what I am doing yet). Kind of like when I started with slay the spire, until you figure out what works and what the great synergies are. The artstyle is cute and I like it.

1831,136761550.0,1811990,"I don't normally review but the skew of positive/negative reviews seems insane considering how high quality this product is.

Difficulty: This is most people's main gripe but if you love a challenge with rogue like deckbuilders, then Wildfrost is excellent. It is harder to begin with than Monster Train or Slay the Spire but this difficulty eases up as you unlock more features. Sadly the features take a while to unlock, but are very easy unlocks that encourage you to try out all styles of play in the game. Once you beat the game (and the first difficulty was easily beatable in 5 or so hours) you can add modifiers to increase the difficulty. Personally, I cannot stand rogue likes that are too easy and make you grind through countless ascension levels just to become a challenge. For me, Wildfrost hit the balance of challenge right, otherwise it simply would not be a good game if you won every time.

Graphic and Design: Impeccable, succinct and streamlined.

Balance: This could do with some shakeups as certain playstyles  do feel imbalanced and easier to get results with. However, the game is well balanced with a ton of variety in enemies.

I highly recommend this to any deckbuilder veterans.

Wildfrost is a well executed roguelike deckbuilder with an engaging gameplay loop, clean and cute designs, interesting core mechanics, and a variety of valid strategies. As many others have already stated, the game is difficult but definitely not unbeatable or (imo) unbalanced. The game requires careful consideration and planning during battles which might mean taking a few minutes per turn every now and again. From my personal experience, most of my runs have ended owing to faulty decision on my end rather than unbeatable enemy encounters. It is not only vital to collect cards that synergize but also to have answers for various enemy types and situations in your deck. 

Overall, if you have played and enjoyed similar games, I can wholeheartedly recommend Wildfrost and I truly hope that the unwarranted percentage of negative reviews does not rob the game of the attetion it deserves.",1.0

1835,136762192.0,307950,"After having played for 23 hours and getting a good grip with the game I can recomend it. The game is fun, the gunplay is good, not the best I've seen but still good and for a change it actually has PVE modes (imagine a game that does that in 2023, it's almost as if the developers wanted the game to have success). I played  the PVP and PVEVP to try once for the rewards but honestly I'm not a fan of anything with PVP, however it seemed just fine though take my opinion on the PVP content with a grain of salt.

The buisness model seems fairish. The prices are a bit high for cosmetics in my opinion but it seems fine otherwise. It's is playable free and I really don't believe that buying anything is required at all. You can gain XP faster if you have premium but because your money will not progress anywhere nearly as fast as your XP, grinding the money is the real deal and therefore you don't even need premium. Something could be said about being able to spend real money for the in game money trade which reminds me of the aweful rates of WoT and such (this game used to be tied to wargamming not sure if it still is) but overall it seems alright.

The negatives points from my perspective are in the customisation. Characters are gender locked and though other skins exist they are always the same gender. This is a big let down for me and since the gender makes no different in the gameplay, it would be better to allow everyone to play whatever gender they want, even if through a skin. If they lowered the prices but made many skins of different genders it could easily become a good revenue source.

Another thing that you can't customise is your loadout. You can swap your cosumables to some minor degree and chose whether or not to add the fixed upgrades you unlock for your guns. You don't get to chose what scopes you have and what silencers you have and different mag types and so on. I believe this will let down a lot of players and though it would change the gameplay a bit, especially with the mags I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to balance. Another let down is how all scopes are fixed zoom (at least I haven't seen them being able to zoom in and out but I could have missed it).

All in all, it's still a fun game and it's free so give it a try, it won't cost you anything.",1.0

I believe the goal of the maps was to move towards a yellow mineral which moved me to a different map with other blips on the map. Walking through trees is possible, and I saw no collision detection. The deer I was controlling had very strange colours, and the deer had a slight animation problems when it was running up or down hills. I would have preferred a more natural looking deer. The most off putting thing is when walking up or down a hill and the immobile camera showed the underside of the hill. The sky coloured bottom below my deer and short line of land separating my deer from falling forever wasn't relaxing to see. My deer didn't fall through the land though, so big plus.

1849,136762209.0,2328760,"TLDR: Bring some stonking good PC hardware for the raytracing & HDR benefits, otherwise you may as well stick to FX3 for the time being, until further optimisations are made.

My vote could go either way on Pinball FX at the present moment.  My own *personal* experience would lean toward a highly-qualified ""recommended"", but only because I have a rather powerful gaming PC and an HDR display that can do this title justice.  I have an 11th gen i7 processor and a RTX 3070Ti GPU with a 144hz Gsync 1440p HDR display... which is upper mid-tier hardware atm.  I can run Pinball FX with Raytracing and HDR enabled in Portrait/TATE mode at @100-120 fps.... at 70% display scaling (1080p effectively).  This isn't as bad as it sounds, because it would seem that display scaling doesn't not affect rendered element in a linear fashion.  The playfield texture resolution, for example, seems to maintain 100% (or close) resolution even at 70% scaling, so it's really only the 3D ramps/rails and raytracing elements that seem to lose definition with the reduced scaling.

The point is - expect that you'll need to compromise on some settings if you have anything less than an RTX 4090 gpu.  To my mind, 60fps is simply not good enough for natural-feeling pinball.  You will probably have to turn down some settings to hit a smooth, flowing, responsive FPS.  I find that it needs at least a more-or-less consistent 90 FPS before it starts looking/feeling good.  120 FPS or higher is buttery smooth.  And of course, you need to have Vsync disabled, or you will feel the input lag.  Which also means that your display will require variable refresh rate  (VRR/GSync/FreeSync) or you will experience tearing.  Some of this is not Pinball FX's fault, to be fair.

This new Pinball FX has exactly 2 things going for it, as compared to the previous Pinball FX3: raytraced lighting and HDR support.  The updated physics are... fine... but I thought they were fine before.  If your PC hardware doesn't have some serious heft to it in order to push raytracing and HDR... well, then... you might as well stick to FX3 imo.

But, with raytracing and HDR enabled.... wow.  I mean, it really is quite visually stunning!  Being able to play my two favourite IRL tables of all time in Pinball FX (Twilight Zone and The Addams Family), in portrait mode, with raytracing and HDR enabled.  That's the stuff of my dreams - it's really, really excellent.  I would massively recommend THAT experience.  But you won't get THAT experience unless you come packing a behemoth of a dedicated PC gaming rig, and that's the main reason I can't give a thumbs-up right now.

Pinball FX doesn't currently support AMD FSR 2.0 (or higher - 3.0 is releasing soon) and it doesn't support DLSS.  So, enabling raytracing on support hardware will cut your FPS *BY HALF* -seriously!  It feels like a lot more people could enjoy these tables the way they're meant to be enjoyed if this software were to support current upscaling technologies.  Also, Pinball FX claims to finally support custom camera settings for each table.  That's only slightly true.  The settings are incredibly limited to just a few broad camera tilt adjustments at the moment.  That's not proper custom camera support.  Pinball FX claims to have cabinet settings for a separate backglass and DMD positioning.  But if you enable it, the application drops from fullscreen into borderless windowed mode, meaning you're stuck with Windows always-enabled Vsync (input lag!) and a 60 FPS cap.  Lame!

There's a lot of potential here for the developers to implement performance-saving image upscaling methods, more granular display settings, proper custom camera settings, and more.  If they do, then I will change my review and give my full heartfelt recommendation.  But, as it stands today, proceed with caution.

as someone who's played and owned all the old cartridges back in the day, let me say this release has been a bit of a dream come true. 

QoL changes, AI upscale filter for my old eyes, everything I know and love is in here + extra.

If you do the math the way I did at $60 USD, each game, including the alternate versions (3 White/Blue, 4RedSun/BlueMoon, 5Proto/Colonel, 6Gregar/Falzar) you absolutely SHOULD play both versions as they contain entirely separate characters in the story that you'll face off against. so to get the entire Battle Network 3 experience you'll need to play both Blue and White, etc. 

based on this alone I already justified the purchase as a steal at $6 per game, with working Online Multiplayer functions. They imported that Japanese exclusive Battle Chips that were only given away during promotions and the only way to get them in America was to use a GameShark or ActionReplay

2: Is this a good game/franchise to get into

oh my god, yeah, this is really good shit. 10/10.
an action RPG, with card battler elements, and fast-paced battles with a strategic 3x3 grid layout. 

The combat is the coolest and hardest thing to describe and it's only after you mess around with the intricate systems and start virus busting and building out your chip library and finding cool Program Advances that you really get a feel for it and it becomes so rewarding and enjoyable. 

if any part of you is even considering playing this or is a little bit curious; definitely check it out. These games are so near and dear to me and they will always have a special place in my heart.

Tray Racers is a really fun procedurally generated party racing game. There are currently 2 game modes (not sure if there will be more in the future): time trials and racing lobbies. Up to 16 people can race in a lobby, and because the tracks are randomized, it always feels like you have a chance at winning since it's not like anyone gets the advantage of practicing before you. The way the races work is you get 5 minutes of practice all together and then one final race. The winners are determined by both the practice trial times and the final race time.

I played this game on stream as well and had chat members join in for races, and it was extremely fun and everyone had a great time. Tray Racers oozes charm and the surprise of ""what comes next"" with each race keeps everyone's attention.

1900,136765319.0,1364020,"I do recommend this game, but not now. Best to wishlist and wait for the game to be in a better state.

My thoughts so far on the game:

The Good:
- The gunplay is amazing! No weapon is too strong or too weak.
- Movement is also a solid plus. Can be a bit clunky at times, but gets better with practice.
- Operators in game have stats and abilities that are unique to them, loadout options are pretty flexible.
- No Astrophysics PhD required!

The Bad:
- No region locked servers, so it's practically guaranteed that you'll encounter players above 300 ping.
- Uses ACE anti-cheat, which can be a red flag for some people.
- Operator abilities have 0 description on how they work, so you're basically forced to figure it out for yourself.
- Some maps are small, other maps are way too large. Some maps are predominantly indoors, other maps demand fighting out in the open.
- An in-game currency (obtained as a reward for leveling up) which, at the time of writing this review, has no use whatsoever.

1926,136765134.0,2367980,"[i]The Witch, Wife, & the Wish[/i] is a very short single-read novel without any choices that will take less than 30 minutes to read from start to finish.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Westley is a married man whose wife is lost to him.  She is suffering from a malady which means she cannot remember him.  So he leaves his village to visit a witch in a nearby enchanted forest; a witch who “sells” wish fulfilment in order to make a living.

He asks her to cure his wife so that they can live happily together again.  What transpires is a very bittersweet narrative which builds the relationship between customer (Westley) and supplier (Charlotte, the witch) before revealing the truth – which, in itself, is very easy to pre-empt just by absorbing the initial exchanges.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
Despite its extreme brevity, by keeping it very simple and focusing on only the two main players (although a 3rd person does appear briefly) and the one story thread, the writer successfully creates a false depth which makes the leads endearing and has the reader supporting them.

For a free game, both graphics and sound are fine.  Graphically simple, with a slight blur on the background which fits the atmosphere.

The English isn't [i]quite[/i] perfect, but it's close enough to not matter.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
For me, the game opened in a small window covering about one quarter of the screen.  I found that odd.

There's no “back” button, although there is a good log.

The text speed is preset, so sometimes you're waiting for it to finish before reading or moving on, as it is not instant.

At the end of the story, it simply says “The End”, and you have to X in the top corner to close it.

It is literally so short that the story itself remains unresolved.  I'd add that this is as opposed to unfinished, it's clearly meant to be left “open”, but as the writer successfully makes one care about the characters, it's a pity that there isn't a properly satisfactory conclusion.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
It's nice, sweet, and for less than the time it takes to wait while dinner cooks, it fills time pleasantly when you have a little gap that isn't long enough to do anything else.  It's definitely worth a visit, it won't cost you anything except a few minutes that you probably wouldn't use more constructively anyway if you found the opportunity to look in the first place.

Quite an easy recommendation, this one.

TL:DR
Negative review = Skill issue",1.0
1935,136769095.0,1811990,"The negative reviews for this game are extremely misleading but common issues are understandable here. However: it's entirely unfair to negative-review bomb a game to this degree. When I want somethings' reputation to suffer, it's because the product is failing to function as a game: crashing, undeveloped, you know, it feels like crap and plays like crap

This game runs clean, all content is extremely well implemented and balanced, and the charming atmosphere is polished to a standard that most game studios never achieve. This game is well-loved and well worth the price, especially the soundtrack. There are many effective deck-strategies that are as fun as they are different from another. What I'm trying to say is, the reviews requesting balance changes appear to be from a misguided consensus conversation happening elsewhere, probably on a reddit, because it's not reflected here in the game.

The reasons for the disconnect between players and the games current state are better explained by the two problems that are confusing players. 

1. Many mechanics are simply not clearly explained, leaving the player surprised at the results of some actions listed on the cards. This is a serious issue, I've had entire runs ruined by a single turn and it was frustrating to learn 'the hard way' how something works. This problem can be fixed easily and the developer will likely straighten the verbiage out soon. Keep in mind that smaller game studios will have these issues without a AAA QA team, Not worth a negative review though.

2. There is a steep learning curve using aforementioned unclear mechanics. This problem becomes far less punishing after you've unlocked most of the content after several runs. I've won multiple times now but only after many losses. This is also a serious problem and likely why players are bouncing off the game. Expect your first runs to be losses . My recommendation would be for the developer to create a shorter adventure track that earns double rewards until you unlock the second tribe, just to give newer players a fair shot at beating the entire gameloop before they hit the grind.

Despite those problems, this game is immensely satisfying and rewards clever planning and synergizing
I hope this review can persuade you that this is a diamond of a deckbuilder currently buried beneath a pile of snow. The reviews telling you it's an unbalanced mess, i.e 'the game is doomed because the foundation of balance is crap from the beginning', are totally inaccurate.

Due to that, instead of playing the style I feel like, I feel that I'm constantly pushed to either switch styles every run or reset until I get a decent leader (which takes a lot of steps for something the equivalent of a reroll button) This is especially frustrating when trying to unlock everything or hunt achievements.",0.0

Cons-The narrative aspect is at odds with the gameplay.

1970,136767329.0,1183800,"A very charming XCOM-like, but it is *not* kidding around. I regularly play XCOM 2 on Legendary, and even Normal difficulty here is a significant challenge. I'm sure synergies and optimal strategies will emerge over time as I gain experience, but just know that it's not watered down. 

The primary difference to XCOM-style engagements is that the ultimate goal is escape, not victory. The more loot and remaining HP you escape with, the better. But the game often forces you to prioritize HP, loot, or XP over each other with no neat answers. It also runs on autosaves, which disallows save-scumming and really ratchets up the tension.

1. The game is ~35 minutes long.

3. Melee, sniper, kamikaze, just three enemies, all roughly at same health, no particular strategies about them. Some vehicular bosses but no helicopters to shoot or whatever.
4. [b]You don't need to kill anything[/b].  Far too many enemies constantly spawning anyway. Just dash forward with the hook to skip to next level, killing enemies is pointless. It's consistently easy to out-regenerate them on Normal.
5. All guns feel the same. You can kick people with your foot, or don't. You can also kill them with the hook I guess. Doesn't matter. No depth to combat whatsoever.
6. Physics have this wonky Unity feel to them. Some objects are surprisingly not solid at all (especially on the final level, but all destroyed vehicles are also super wonky).
7. Technical issues (game freezing at loading screens, not preserving the selected language, framerate issues on one level). They'll probably get fixed but they aren't now.

1982,136767901.0,2273470,"this game, even for a prologue, has a lot that it needs to improve. currently there is no displayed way to skip time for any more than 3 hours(technically three hours because of glue drying time option)  so delivery set for two days is agonizingly long and pointless for a prologue; fortunately there's a delivery speed setting that can be changed, but i haven't noticed any difference using it yet. not only that, but there are barely any graphics settings for performance, and it has a lot of room for improvement with realism. painting on different layers in this game is not realistic at all, and this comes from someone whose father has half a dozen guitars and has watched a couple of his guitars been painted before. 

overall for the game, however, is very bright in its potential. i see this game as having a very promising future in its release, but as for the prologue, it's very rusty and confusing. the tutorial isn't the most help in the process, and you oftentimes have to figure out things on your own.

so to conclude, is this game good and flexible? not very much, but it has lots of room for improvement and plenty of time to fix itself. just currently, it feels like a lower-quality type of simulator game that has to do with building things, partially due to the non-realistic aspects of some steps taken during assembly. the full game without a doubt is going to be better than this unless the developer(s) don't make any changes to the process of each order in the game.",0.0

Adding animation to make it to where people can't spam the reload to quickly similar to pavlov could be a great way of implementing this. I feel reloading is a core experience to a vr shooter. I also think weapon skins and character skins would be cool to add in the future for completing milestones. The game is already $30 so I think paying for cosmetics could be hit or miss, if paid ones are in the game I think some should be added to be earned from milestones (challenges) Of course new maps in the future should be added, but the 3 we have now are fun so far. You should be able to hold items in your hands so when the new round starts you can hand things to your teammates, you survived the round you should keep all items.

One of the things I loved most about Unscripted is the way the game allows the player to make choices that have a real impact on the story, I am mostly talking about the River path. There are a few choices I haven't expected to go that way, so I had to Save before, and check them on later.

So far, there is a lot that I really like about the game, but one major thing that has impacted my enjoyment. I have pretty sensitive eyes and can get eye strain easily. The issue is this: the camera sensitivity in the game is TOO TOO sensitive, which means it's very easy to get eye fatigue, feel nauseated, etc. I literally turned my camera sensitivity to zero and turned off head bob and could only manage two hours of gameplay before I had too bad of a headache to continue.

1993,136771988.0,1811990,"The visuals are fantastic and the game involves lots of tactical opportunities. Most mistakes feel very punishing and hard to recover from which makes you focus on most decisions.
There seems to be tons of varieties to be had with the different factions and tons of different main characters randomized for each run. Some of these options are very easy to master but some way way way less so.

Unfortunately like many people say there are some balance issues and some runs are guaranteed lost early cause there was nothing else that you could do provided with what the run got you.
While this is a factor in other roguelites like Slay the Spire that many people compare it to, it isn't nearly as prevalent there as it is in this game.

When it comes to locations that you visit during your run, it feels like that is one of the games greatest shortcomings.
Because the power level that they provide to the team is also very drastic.
You pretty much always want to upgrade your cards, if that location isn't available then you want to get money so that you potentially can get a shop so that you can upgrade your cards even more. 
But there are some terrible upgrades in the sense that they are extremely situational like reducing the attack of your cards and giving a special type of hp that only can be applied to certain creatures.
Getting good upgrades feel essential for a good run cause some of the upgrades are really awesome
Some locations are unlocked later in the game that gives you some options, but from my experience upgrades are key.

Even after all these negative aspects, I'm still enjoying myself. Combat feels like a puzzle because you don't want your allies to die because then the next fight will be harder and you don't want your main character to tank too much and die because then the run is over. When it all looks over and you realize that you can survive one turn more and it just snowballs into a win is one of the best feelings to have in this game,
You move around your team constantly to get the best types of attack and defense, it just works so well!

If you get this game, try to go in with an open mind and don’t expect to get a win or go very far. There is some rng that can feel devastating, like the enemy having a single minion that can wipe your entire team cause you had no way to play around it or even worse that the enemy makes 3 random attacks and your main character goes from full hp to zero resulting in a loss. But in the end all you can do is try again until it works.

This game definitely doesn't deserve to have Mixed reviews cause it can be so much fun and it has tons of potential.

2003,136770464.0,307950,"Caliber is a third person shooter with abilities and gadgets feeling mostly unique across the 64 operators available in the game. I have been playing this game for exactly 1 year since April 2022 and in that time, I have seen the game shaped for the better. The developers have been very receptive to the community feedback and are constantly improving on the game. There have been numerous changes to the economy, operators, matchmaking, and finally the inclusion of NA, SA, LATM, and EU servers on steam.

PROS:
•	The game is free to play and costs nothing for the user to get into the game. Players have a complete range of content to choose from for all game modes and over 60 operators.
•	Operators can be leveled up for 15 levels and have a nonlinear trait progression where you can select a trait/passive for each level as you progress.
•	There are four different roles to choose from and the PVP matchmaking allows you to select any number of 16 operators for each of the roles. 
•	There are skills that can be unlocked and selected from each operator. You can select the 4 different skills to run on your operator as additional passives. The skills can be changed on the fly before the start of your game, just after the operator selection phase. This allows you to choose a set of skills based on the map or enemy operator choices making the game feel dynamic with a depth of options to choose from.
•	There are executions and emotes that are top notch. You can pick up your enemy and slap them in the face to finish off/execute them. I'm adding this in here because it truly is one of the best things that I've ever seen in any video game. It must be the most disrespectful way to execute someone.
•	Reserves cost nothing and you are given them free at the start of every game.
•	There is no lean peeking in the game which lends itself to a more effective TTK.
•	TTK is in a great place for the majority of the operators.
•	This is a TPS which involves a lot of gun skill. It is easy to get into and play as a new player of TPS games.
•	Games are only 5-10 minutes long with 2- or 3-minute rounds and first to 3. This means the games are over and done quickly. It’s easy to pick up and put back down again.
•	Developers are open to feedback and are working tirelessly to produce all of the changes that were requested over the last year.

CONS:
•	The games sometimes feel too short leaving me wanting a bit more. I would consider adding more rounds to the game modes to give a bit more time in a match.
•	Some of the operators (especially medics) can feel hopeless when you match up against very tanky supports. I’ve heard some criticism about a few specific operators feeling like they’re shooting marshmallows. The problem with this is buyers’ remorse and players not being happy with their selection of operator. This happens in every game and can be difficult for players to get over. 
•	With a game having 60 operators, there are balancing issues because it’s very hard to balance 60 operators equally without a couple feeling unfair. Currently there are about 15 or so operators that stand out among the pack and have become the “go to” operators for the game. I would like to see other operators that are weaker get buffs to bring them closer in line with the best operators.
•	The BattlePass is not available at certain times. The BattlePass should always be available and give players the option to buy those operators. Additionally, these operators should be able to be purchased for a larger number of credits which should be reduced to a normal amount of credits when the next BattlePass comes out.
•	The amount of time it takes to get an operator to level 15 can feel a bit overwhelming and grindy. But I would like to point out that you do not need to get every character to level 15 when there are only 15 or so that are considered the top of the pack. This reduces the grind considerably. I would like to see the amount of credits that players earn increase a little bit.

Conclusion:
I know that a lot of players would say this game is pay-to-win and that was (past tense) previously the case before they did the economy rework. I think that the changes that they have made over the last year have really moved the game into a great place where players can get anything in the game as long as they spend the time playing it. With the new Daily and Weekly objective system and all the new player exclusive benefits, players can earn their first few operators very quickly. Additionally, for those completionist who want every operator unlocked, there is always something to grind for. The game’s hit registration feels very crisp, and gunplay is the most important aspect in this game. The 60 different skills, 15 different traits, 4 different reserves, and 60 different operators give the game a depth that will pique your interest and constantly keep the game fresh. As someone who normally doesn’t like TPS games, this TPS game is at the top of the list and will easily become a main stay.",1.0

Be wary: THERE IS NO REAL COOP IN THIS GAME, it was added with the same idea in mind - ""lets add something that are not fun and doesn't work just because Battle Brothers don't have that"".

There is a beautiful 3D world. Where nothing is randomized, so replayability is very low.
There is plot. With quests where you ""sorta"" have a choice, but in reality you don't, as decisions are forced on you, and it won't affect anything storywise anyway after you do 4 quests in a region.
There is crafting with clicking minigames. That's okay, but i'm really bored clicking on circles for 100th time. And you can craft gear with only the most basic abilities, which you don't want to use, believe me.
Combat is fun for the first 10 hours, then it became sleep fest as the damage doesn't scale too much, ""fast"" combat animation isn't really fast, and it took forever to finish a turn with 8+ companions. There are no zones of control and no 
matter how thick your frontline is, AI will sneak though it, so no chokepoints for you except rare cases of map generation. Also, fire is very !FUN! mechanic (no).
Arenas are pure cancer. Wanted and suspicion mechanics are annoying and is not fun. Trading is nonexistent. Regions are alike. Scaling is unfair - I guess that won't be an issue if I play on regional difficulty, but I won't start the game from the beginning, as there is literally no replay value and I will make the exact same things for 17 hours.

Good. . . ish is probably the best way to describe my experience with Hunt the Night. On the surface it has a lot of things working for it that, in theory are fun, but it doesn't quite seem to know what do do with those mechanics. This game is sort of a shotgun scatter of different ideas that are loaded into it but never really seem to reach their true potential. 

The combat is sufficient, but the enemies don't really telegraph their moves so much as you learn the patterns and then just get the timing down. Enemies who shoot projectiles are almost easier to deal with than anything with a melee moveset. 

The exploration is fine, but the lack of a map means that a lot of the areas sort of just blend together and it's hard to get a sense of where you are at times. 

Power progression is strange in this game. It doesn't really exist. The weapons don't feel like they do enough to differentiate themselves from one another, the spells feel generally lacking, and the most direct upgrades are all to tertiary systems. Health is tied to optional hunts, finding sanguine altars, and your gear. It feels strange to have 3 direct ways of influencing your maximum health. It might have felt better if the altars increased your base strength or did something else other than just increase your max health because the optional hunts already do that too. Stats are all sort of okay. Hemostasis causes your attacks to heal you and Plagus is just a poison DoT. Those are the only two, and Hemostatis is objectively better because of the limited healing resources. 

Overall this game feels like a bite-sized version of a more full experience, and that has nothing to do with the actual length of the game. It's moreso that there's less nuance with the subsystems in the game than I expected. The campaign of the game is there, but the rest of it is still stuck in an early access stage. Some things should have been left out, while others should have been expanded. The traversal with Umbra is one of those things. It just doesn't feel fun, and it breaks the pacing of the exploration too much.

The music and art are good. There's clearly a lot of passion put into the lore and world overall. The gameplay just leans into being  good enough, and so the game winds up feeling 'good-ish'. 

A very light recommendation from me. I think it's price point saves it in this regard.",1.0

I contacted them in email, (no reply) but in discord they responded and said its been an issue they're aware of and that they will work on it asap since they were gathering as much info as possible. I worked with them, sent them copies of my dxdiag. Tried some things they suggested. So i left the demo on a positive note, thinking it'll be bugfixed before release.

However,
I recently bought it, and copies as gifts for friends.
Sadly, I thought the issue was addressed. It was not.
Same issue. Crashing around the 20 minute mark.

It is so fast-paced I would wager most people start and finish this game in one sitting. This is very possible because the game's campaign, as it were, only takes about 40 minutes to complete (I took 45, though I died a few times). There is also an infinite mode though, which is a good addition that adds to replayability.

At this price point for me its a biiit lean for my liking and in spite of how much I enjoyed the time I had with the game, I initially considered refunding it since I had thought this was all we were going to get until a MEATGRINDER 2 due the lack of an Early Access tag. Thankfully however, I saw I had made a mistake, because the devs have said in a Discussions post that they are actively working on new levels and achievements to add in the near future. I hope the game gets fleshed out significantly more in subsequent updates because I can't wait to return to grind more MEAT!!!

1. Unlocking weapons is too difficult, I don't even know how to other then a basic idea of killing a boss with a weapon and getting that weapon afterwards.
2. The zombies (And ESPECIALLY bosses) are relentless, and sometimes during blood moons they will just KNOW where you are. Keep in mind I've gone out of my way to avoid this by closing all the doors of the house i'm in, sitting in a room with no windows relatively in the center of the house, and they still find you.
Bosses have it much worse, they will follow you and follow you for eternity, even if you die or suicide.
3. The bosses are WAAAY to difficult. I just quit the game during the Riot Boss fight during the second phase. It literally has a gun and even 150 damage is barely even a few pixels of his HP bar.
4. Literally every single Rifle is underpowered, even the RAREST rifles. This normally wouldn't be too much of a problem in an Open Alpha, but the rarity of rifles combined with the fact that most use Sniper Ammo, the most RARE ammo, makes it a huge issue.

Although there's some UX issues I've stumbled upon I expect them to be fixed and the whole game to be improved upon in the future, even though the team who created the game is small, I will be more than happy to support this game and excitingly wait for future updates.

2065,136773224.0,1811990,"To be clear I like this game close to love but it has a few balancing issues that i cant get over currently and this is why i'm post a negative till its balanced out. As of this review i have 11 hours into this game and almost all unlocks in town and have beaten the game once but as stated some issues i do want to point out to hope they get adjusted or fixed out right that will make this game better to new comers and over all. I will also state the reason for each negative and leave spoilers out of the review till the end to be clear.

Pros
- Mechanics: out of all the deck builder's and roguelikes i have played it stands out and is fun most times.

- Keywords: All are great and add fun aspects to them except for two of them explained later.

- Clans: Cool and distinct to one another.

- End game: Mechanic on how it plays the first time and home it gets harder is super cool and unique.

- Events/Pathing: Simple and impactful.

- Enemies/encounter: Fun and cool that they are themed.

-Sound: The game sounds great to play with and relax.

-The inventors Hut: feels great to unlock and start using.
Negatives
- Keywords: 
          - Aimless: is fine for the player to use but as for the enemy it feels unfair from as low as sometimes to out right unfair. The reason is that once the leader is low or even has low hp to start it feels unfair when you can't stop aimless from snipping the leader in just the short 11 hours i have played i have had to many runs end because the aimless seemed to only aim at the leader and i was unable to kill all 5 of them on the field by the time they did snipe my leader just does not feel good as a player to leave so many enemies to attack randomly. To fix this i suggest just adding a indicator when you hover over them to where they plan on attacking keep it random but show us where it is landing if the players line up stays the same if changed because of another attack changing the players lay out then the enemy changes target location or something to the like allowing it to feel a bit more fair because i knew where it was attacking or have a bit less enemies with aimless 
          - Overburn: To be fair over burn on allies are fine and the enemies that have it is also fine the issue is mainly the ending and how that works knowing that i had a god run as my 4-5 run where i beat the final boss with no issue but now with the endgame mechanic i'm stuck with dealing with a over HP god run boss that once he gets to attack i loss because the amount of overburn i get in that one attack it is just over( to be clear my boss has 54hp and 8 overburn with barrage and with most allies and leaders having low hp pools that's a wipe on that row but the other allies also are problems with 2 willows, berry sis with teeth charm, big berry, 2 plums, and 2 Vesta's (glad they lost double overburn)don't know if hp matters for allies but you try to kill this team before they can attack i wait.) the issue is that overburn on a player is fine but keeping as high on the final boss is bafulling and currently ended 10 runs a few with ink but not a good way to obtain make sit to hard to have by then. My suggestion just if they have overburn half the amount.

- Clans: Clans are great the issue comes with the cards you can get because you have 3 clans but dont lock off the cards that arnt from the leaders clan leads to too many different archetypes competing to be in the players deck it's a simple fix  by having all allies you save being a 2/3 being from the players selected leader at all times making it be more consistent for the playes deck and there skill being needed to beat each fight not luck on a good ally being in the deck and not junk compared to your leader just sucks having a game where i only got allies that apply demonize but have only low attack leaders that dont really get to take advantage of it.

-Store/event: The only issue that i have is that it feels a bit odd that the store sells random charms and the event sells them out right i feel like either the store should also sell charms out right just 1-2 or they should switch this is just a personal thing and i know that don't know how others feel about it just does not make since to me that the store does not sell any at all.

-Leader: The leader system is cool but i feel like you need to give the player a additional reward for there leader when completing a boss where they get stronger and not just the game charm this mainly comes from me having an issue with the final boss i have right now just a small increase like they get more damage because they found a better weapon more health because better cloths or food for more energy to attack sooner and then remove the ability to add charms or restrict it to 1 or something similar may need a good amount of testing but it just sucks having a leader that dies in one hit late game.

-Charms: only issue is having no way of getting rid of charms you won't/cant use, allow us to sell them because having a scrap charm when your deck is summons based. Sucks even more when you don't even see another way to allow you to use it.

-Boss Charm: I don't know if they are more because of said issue but the first one should only affect 1 ally each fight because i lost a few match's where a minion with 9 attack got frenzy and was in the back line while one with teeth charm was in the front just felt unfair that the enemy had more charms then i did and since they are all minion related they are almost all better for them unlike my charm that i got randomly that i could not use yet.

- Unlocks: the unlocks don't feel great to unlock because they don't really impact your run as they should so far i have only bought one from a store and have yet to choose one for my deck because they don't seem as impactful as they should be.

-Pets: pets feel fine but i feel like they need a bit more adjustment they should be a good ally but feel like garbage and a waste of a turn sometimes to play.

-Hot Spring: Most of these allies feel bad to use in most cases considering you had to unlock them and they are barely as good as other allies you already have. 

I really like this game and want it to be great so i'm posting this as a thing to know about and can look into at least to improve the game but being a game designer i understand the troubles of balance and designing but keep it up you guys have a great game here and i want to keep playing it.

However, you can't even display them the way you want because they don't let you mix collectibles from different tables (unless they're from the same genre of pinball tables).

Tables can only be changed so much until they are not real life comparisons.

Some also are deterred by the fact that Pinball FX3 (and its engine) is over 5 years old at this point and shifted to unreal, giving people some decent discounts (or even free transfers) on tables they have previously released (PinballFX2->Pinball FX3) for quite some time. Be wise on your selections.

the content may be identical, but they have been updated and nobody does all their work for free,
so why should you expect to get something for free because of the decision you made?
(facts are facts about issues, but that doesn't mean you can complain when it isn't warranted :) )

You aren't going to get EVERYTHING transferred over for free. You've seen Dark Souls: Remastered, and other games that have been released at the time.
This is why most games that do remasters give discounts (sometimes generous/deep) to the owners of the previous versions. Zen does this in their own way while bringing new tables in on top of that.

Remember: this game is free to play, free to start, to anyone and everyone can make a review here, and this just came to steam.

-Very fun to play! Not a lot of players yet so it's hard to get a full match, and there definitely doesn't seem to be a system to balance teams, so you WILL have 5vs2 matches.

-Maps are decent but everything kind of blends together shape and color wise, so orientation is a bit hard to get used at first to with the additional axis of mobility.

Controllers:  (Why? A: not using a desk B: Ergo...) 

- ADS is the same for all guns whether it's a pistol or a sniper, which does technically make sense being in space but, it makes swapping weapons mid game basically impossible without changing the setting every time.

 - Can't swap weapons and automatically return to ADS. (personal, but still seems like an oversight when trying to make a fluid control scheme.)

- Don't know if this is a controller specific thing, but once I'm on a surface it feels like I'm stuck to it unless I do some odd moves to get off and away from it.

Something fast paced, with great music, wonderful visuals and a satisfying sense of power, that kind of quick power trip is so therapeutic, you just need it sometimes, to kill boredom, anxiety, depression, you name it, maiming it in the digital space has always helped my people. 

This feels like one of those great games you would pick up on the weekend, even if you beat it on a sitting, you would play that thing over and over, well, at least us 90s kids would. Man, I wish kids today knew how to have fun, it sucks that fun is missing from so many peoples lives...

2115,136775336.0,1727270,"Great movie, bad gameplay.

To be honest I am super conflicted about my opinion on the game. Let's start with the good. You get all the D'Avekki goodness. These excellent British actors that (from a couch) bring you into a mysterious town which oozes atmosphere. You get all the D'Avekki tropes... Aislinn De'Ath playing a lady to die for, Rupert Booth voicing the policeman, Cameo-Girl gets a bigger cameo this time and so on. As a fan of D'Avekki, it feels like the family has yet again brought you another wonderful few hours to lose yourself in - and I'm pretty greatful for that. Tim has also learned to not overdo it with the jumpcuts this time^^. Compared to the other titles, the characters are a bit less subtle and a bit more on the nose this time. But the tone has been hit very well. 
If there's one complaint I can bring forward in terms of the whole world-building then it's that for the first time, then, for the first time in a D'Avekki game, the lore has been spiked with animal cruelties, which for me personally is something that drains the enjoyment out of the game. In fact I'm quite angry about that, and especially Sally's remarks in that regard makes this game trash-bin material for me. For me, it's a biggy, but I'm aware this will be irrelevant to most players.

Anyway, let's address the elephant in the room - the gameplay. Now one D'Avekki trope is certainly to take bad UI design and make it the sole gameplay loop. Which kinda works weirdly enough for most of the games, this time though, it's a bit too cumbersome.

So, there are 6 suspects in the game. There are three days, at each day, each suspect will be asked one question by the police, which amounts to ""are you guilty in this aspect"" and the subject will answer with yes, no or maybe. You pick out the person, which answered yes to all three and tadaaa... you win.
All other information is irrelevant. It's unimportant who had the strongest motive and who would be the most capable or just any other background information. It's just these three questions and their answers that matter.

Where the irrelevant fluff information gets used is in unlocking these police questions. Each suspect has three fluff-topics which need to be activated in order. To do that, you hang a painting onto a slot with the corresponding topic and a cutscene will play. The contents are irrelevant, you just need to match the topic. The painting have an ammo-counter, which needs reloading after 6 questions and ammo is scarce. So you can't just ask them all the topics. And the other thing that happens is that the slot will change to show another topic now.
It's not difficult, it's not challanging, it's not compelling, it's not deep, it's just annoying. It feels like they didn't want to make it perfectly easy, so they put the topic-change mechanic in and they wanted the possiblity for the player to fail so they put the ammo-counter in.

Now there are some secrets and some unlocks on repeated play-throughs. So, you're incentivised to play through the game multiple times. There's some randomization going on, but really, even that is done very half-backed, you see the assets not lining up perfetly and so on. Speaking of assets, which the artworks and videos are pretty great, the regular textures and environment certainly aren't. I dig the idea of the art gallery, but the execution is... questionable. Also of course, controls aren't rebindable and a lot of options, such as the fov-slider lack don't show their values.

So, to summerize, this game is an odd mix of the very good and the very bad. It's something where new ground was tested and some aspects sink and some swim. While the atmosphere is stellar, the gameplay is just nothing I could honestly recommend. If you're a fan, I won't read this and will have bought this anyway, which is fine. But if you're new and haven't played the other games yet, start with those.",0.0

You get what you start with and need to make the best of it, which might allow you to think outside of the box.
Take some time to think about each play before you make it, simple.

Now with that out of the way, learning the game can take sometime at first, I think that makes it rewarding in terms of feeding your brain. Chuckle Fish made a banger which was Starbound, I knew I had to buy this because I trust the team and card games have been my kick lately.
And they didn't disappoint.

The game is perfectly balanced, it's just a skill issue for a lot of players who are too lazy to learn something out of their comfort zone.

I",1.0
2119,136776751.0,1811990,"I've been playing since it released a few days ago, and the first thing that stands out is the charming, welcoming presentation. The game rides that fun and cutesy atmosphere as a counter to its (current) lack of balance in player agency and difficulty curve during the course of a run.

I gave this a positive score because the devs have stated they're looking at balance, accessibility, and the difficulty curve in their first few patches, and I'm glad they're taking action. I'm also having fun with the various synergies and strategies that are available. That said, I'd also like to have fun while having a chance at making it further in the game. As of yet, I usually die to the first boss. When I do make it past the first boss (either snowman or monkey) I usually die to the first battle past that point. On the rare occasion I make it past that first battle (usually the purple fellas), that area boss wipes me out in seconds as my party is wounded and my map options unhelpful.

First problem: The leader selection is completely underwhelming. Each leader is a random set of variables that either add up to being a potential burden to your team, or a massive boon that establishes your main strategy. If they simply had a couple leaders to choose from, like they do with pets, I think it would be fun to see what you could do, even if you were still offered a random selection to choose from.

Second problem: The difficulty curve ramps up as you enter the first boss fight, a near cliff face you have to scale with a meager deck of scraps. Each boss enemy has two fazes, yet also has numerous waves of enemies on the same timer as a normal battle, swamping you in priority targets, any of which will destroy you as you try to deal with them, or the boss. The battles that show up past this point are carefully crafted sets of synergies that are designed to show you just how pitiful the synergies you have access to truly are. Better hope you have the right type of deck to deal with each combat, or a linchpin card you guard with your life because it can deal with things you couldn't have predicted running into.

Positive 1: Each card feels like it should have a purpose and a place in your party, even if they are simply fodder to guard your leader in some way. There are many different status effects to wield and administer from poison and curses, to yellow bombs and shells. Each has a purpose, each has a strength, and each is used best by the enemy. Its hard to not frame this somewhat negatively, by pointing out how weak these feel when the player uses them, but they are fun to mess around with in the first stage of the game when you have a chance to do so.

Positive 2: Unlocks are a constant flow for the first few runs you have, before they slowly trickle away as your number of runs increase, but your viability remains the same. The pet system is great and offers a lot of choice in how you augment your usually pitiable leader into a decent force on the battlefield. The art is also ADORABLE, and helps in carrying this aspect. While some unlocks feel minimal, considering they mostly add to already rather extensive card pools, others you can feel the impact of, like the multiple factions. I look forward to seeing any other factions they add, as those add to the gameplay more than anything else you have a choice about!

I'm going to stop there for now. Its a great deck-building roguelike, marred by a difficulty that inflates itself by weakening the player's choices and agency and inflating the enemy's strength by providing numerous synergies and frustration-inducing effects that further limit player agency. I look forward to seeing what the team does to address the balance and difficulty concerns, and will update my review accordingly when they do so. I'm optimistic, so I'm starting it with a YES.",1.0

I paid full price for it and it was totally worth it.

Also if you are the developer reading this, I feel like there are a few charms that could be adjusted. the 3/3/3 charm is almost always negative, the bread charm always is a ""worse charm"" then almost anything else.... and the removing your charm limit is basically never relevant.  I'm not saying remove them, but it certainly is a ""feel bad"" moment when you get the fish charm before the first boss - because it isn't about to help you.

Pros
-Unique world setting (unlike foundation, settlement survival, and banished which are more medieval realism it's take a more fantasy oriented rout with magic""not available yet"" and heros ""limited gameplay"")
-The art style is eye-caching and stimulating and can be very beautiful
-Not the most hardcore survival city-builder, allowing time to plan relax and just have fun
-Build and overview UI wasn't confusing
-The relationship system it has with other neighbouring kingdoms is quirky and fun
-Every Seasons has effect to the overworld ( not just green for spring/summer/fall and white for winter)

Cons
-NPC AI is dumb (farms and resources gathering are full and no one brings them to the storehouse/granaries or to the homes. Once your city take up half the map people starve even when you have alot of food everywhere)
-Very early access (not alot to do past small city stage)
-Certain core resources are limited (like stone) after you run out that's it you cant build anymore
- NPC AI is REALLY DUMB, I know I said this before but it really breaks this game

However, game is kinda easy. If you have no experience with this type of games, play on Normal.
If you [b]ever played any X-COM/Xenonauts/Tactics game[/b], play on Hard and thank me later. 

[h2]Main con - Meta-Progression[/h2]
Wish there was more meta progression, right now you can unlock 2/3 of the unlocks in single game. And the rest requires you to actively play bad (like shoot your own team bad). Because unlocks are locked behind achievements. 
So past single run, game doesn't promote any rewards for playing actively well, with no meta-progression or anything. 
Wish that would change.

2181,136778859.0,1364020,"This is the reboot/clone of Shattered Horizon I've been dreaming of for many years, and I nearly wet myself when the trailers came out! Shattered Horizon was the 1st game I bought on Steam, back when they had that beautiful, clumsy single gun everyone had to use. It took real skill!

 But this game is just not playable for me right now. I have a X5900X CPU, Aorus X570 Master MB, a 2700 Super and 16 GB of ram. The game is installed on a Seagate FireCuda 530 M.2 SSD.  My network card is a 2.5 GB that performs better than my 1GB Intel card. Yet, I have to dial down some settings so the game will stop hitching every couple of seconds, even in the tutorials. The game crashes every minute or two even while going through the menu. Especially while in the keybinds menu! It would be nice if they let us add a comment to our crash reports. 

I thought it was my overclocking of my CPU, or possibly the GPU, so I turned off overclocking. It didn't make a difference. 
I read in the discussions that, being based on Unreal 4, performance issues can be caused by a bad connection, or even an under powered router. I've got the best connection, getting 0 to 50 ping max to several MP games I play. Heck, I believe PUBG is based on the Unreal 4 engine and I don't have these issues. So that seems like total non-sense to me. Maybe it isn't, but not in my case.

It also lacks an important sound option: Choosing your audio devices. I run several and channel stuff through each one. So that would be a really nice addition.

I'm probably going to have to wait a couple of months before this game becomes playable for me.  You've no idea how badly I wanted to be able to buy this game as soon as it came out. But it's just not done yet, so I can't currently recommend it to anyone. Shattered Horizon performed better in its beta stage! When things improve I will definitely recommend it though!",0.0

Gameplay is fun, with the few maps available providing a lot of variety due to varied bombsite placement and dynamic map layouts akin to R6Siege.

This is the first game I've tried on the Pico 4 so this might be due to the haptics of the controller, but the guns can feel a bit weak, not in terms of damage but in terms of gamefeel.

It could certainly do with more varied maps, modes and guns as we go along, but as is it's got everything you need to have fun for many hours, with no bugs to power through. Some things are a bit simplified, but seems to do so to provide a consistent experience. 
The IK system is really well done, with very lifelike movements replicated. It also features a lean system, that let's you use your playspace to lean your ingame body around corners etc. It's very well implemented and having tried it, it feels weird that this isn't a thing in all VR shooters.

- Interesting decisions to make.
- Fun card combos.
- Lots of unlockables.
- Great art and music.

Cons:
- Limited card options out of the gate.
- Takes a while to gain enough knowledge to mitigate the RNG.
- About 30% of your games will end early due to RNG putting you in an impossible situation right out of the gate.

Overall: It's a fun game that definitely scratches that Slay The Spire itch I have.

2213,136781403.0,1811990,"I admit the whole controversy about the difficulty just made me buy the game because I was interested in what of it was true. So here I am and 3,5 hourse later I got my first win after 7 or so attempts. That being said I am a veteran who play most deck builders since Slay the spire and have beaten Library of Ruina without mods. I get how many people could have difficulty beating this game. Some encounters are really hard and some are unbeatable if you dont have a counter in your deck. Knowing that counter in your first playthrough is impossible. 

But this isnt unfair. This is a roguelike with progression. Losing and learning are part of the game. Yes it is extremely difficult. Just like learning to swim is difficult. Your gonna dip your head underwater till you learn it. If you dont wnat that, stay out of the pool.

The game itself is fine, has extremely nice art and is quite different from other games of its kind. Turns are played in a way that you play cards, which either place units, companions and scrap items, on the field or have active effects. Each card you play is a turn that reduces the activation of every unit on the field. Those that hit 0 make their actions (attack, heal, whatever). 

With that you try to kill the enemy boss before your boss dies. Your boss is a unit on the field and you can pick one out of 3 at the start each run. Those have randomized HP, Attack, activation time and special effects. Companions can be recalled to be healed, but if they die they´re gone for the battle and have half HP and Attack for one fight after that. 

You also get charms which you can attach to cards. A lot of charms can be attached to units and active cards. So if a charm increases the number of activations that means your unit can attacks twice when it activates or an active card activates its effect twice and so on. You can attach up to three charms to a card which can lead to really silly and busted combos. And you NEED these. The later fights are unbeatable without at least one busted unit. And this is FUN. I love creating busted combos but in most games having these just means you breeze through the run. Here you need ot do this to have a chance. This means RNG is a large part in what you get. If you dont like that, then this isnt the game for you. If you like building the best of what you get with being force to use extremely different tactics each run, then this is the game for you. 

Spoiler for the end of a run:
There also seems to be a mechanic where the deck you win a run with gets possesed by the boss at the end? I dont know what that means yet, I assume you have to fight your own deck at some point. But since I dont have any more time today I cant tell you what that is about.",1.0
2214,136781243.0,1811990,"I love the game, it's been great fun. My only complaint so far is the lack of counterplay to teeth damage. Unless you have a ton of hp on all your units, or you have built a deck that can direct kill your 10+ hp of problems, teeth damage really don't have the same level of counterplay that all the other keywords have. You can't stop your hero from attacking, so when a unit generates with a random teeth charm on the front line the same turn your hero is ready to attack with their 1 hp, there's just nothing you can do. Which feels extremely punishing for ""bad luck"". 

Unlike most other abilities, neither ink nor frost will bail you out of that situation, and you cannot retreat your hero, so unless you have a self freeze or a kill spell to take out the spawned unit, there's just nothing you can do, which is really annoying.

2225,136782939.0,1364020,"If you're a fan of intense, high-stakes multiplayer shooters, then ""Boundary"" might just be the game for you. Developed by Surgical Scalpels, this tactical space-based shooter game offers a unique and exhilarating experience that's unlike anything else out there.

The game's zero-gravity mechanics are a standout feature, creating an entirely new way to approach combat and movement. Engage in fierce team vs team battles, executing low-gravity operations on orbiting space installations against enemy astroperators and other entities. The gameplay is fast-paced and intense, requiring quick reflexes and strategic thinking to come out on top.

Visually, ""Boundary"" is stunning. The graphics and visual effects are top-notch, making every firefight and zero-gravity maneuver feel immersive and realistic. The attention to detail in the environments and characters is also impressive, adding to the overall atmosphere of the game.

One thing that sets ""Boundary"" apart from other multiplayer shooters is its emphasis on teamwork. Communication and coordination are essential to success, and players who work together will have a definite advantage. This adds an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay, making for a more satisfying and rewarding experience.

Overall, ""Boundary"" is a great game that's well worth a try for fans of tactical shooters. With its unique zero-gravity mechanics, stunning visuals, and emphasis on teamwork, it's a game that's sure to keep you engaged and entertained for hours on end.",1.0

The second round in the game we ran into a bug when hiding in the mansion, I saw that the door was closed and my friend saw the door opened. When the door was closed at his viewpoint, the killer didn't come in and only growled outside. When the door was open at his viewpoint (for me door closed), the killer teleported inside the room and killed my friend at my viewpoint. Otherwise because no one was playing the game public, we didn't get the chance to team up with others to see what they make of it. 
Pros:
-Extremely horrifying, especially if you gaze into the old mansion with the flashlight on when the front door is open. the killer will chase you  from an angle. The doubleface-kids and skeleton props are also bloody and designed well.
-Gives the option to mute scream. Most times I don't get scared at the killer's face but the screams I make.
Cons:
-With the flashlight on, the visible range is too narrow. Realistic to see only a short distance, but only having a cylinder range in the middle of the screen, with total black on both sides creates a sense of being trapped in a bad way. I had to constantly turn my head up, down, left and right to look for stuff, which made me feel irritated and gradually dizzy in two hours.

2247,136785379.0,1811990,"WIldfrost is a new take on a well-trod genre, that of the deckbuilding roguelike.

With an appealing artistic direction, you lead a group of companions through the snowy landscape while facing an array of challenging bosses. At its core, each run is about both creating a strong deck and making tight tactical decision during a variety of combats. Your deck must be one that straddles the line of both having a synergistic means of scaling against increasingly tough threats while also having the versatility to deal with many different threats, which proves an engaging challenge. This is akin to similar games such as Slay the Spire, but the margin for error here is tighter, which is likely the cause for many of the negative reviews. Secondly, each encounter requires maneuvering your units around enemies that are on discrete timers, reminiscent of Through the Breach. 

In testing both dimensions, Wildfrost creates an experience that is greater than the sum of its parts. With some added quality of life features and some balancing (note, the issue here is more about the perception of balance than any actual balance), Wildfrost will become one of the top roguelike deckbuilders if it is not already.

Strong recommend

Edit: Upon looking at the other reviews, at present (April 16, 2023), the English language reviews are 85% positive while all reviews are at ~65% positive, meaning that non-English reviews are less than 50% positive. I'd suspect that there's some issue with how the mechanics are depicted in non-English languages (it seems many of the negative reviews are in Mandarin).",1.0
2248,136785265.0,1811990,"Charming game. The main draw is probably the aesthetics, though the card battling itself is fairly mechanically unique, which is pretty necessary when the 'indie card rogue-lite' genre is currently so over-saturated. It's currently being review bombed for it's atypically harsh difficulty, which isn't at the level where it's worth being called 'unbalanced' or considered an objective flaw, but the game also isn't exactly marketed as the 'dark souls of card games' or anything, so many players seem to have been blindsided. 

If you aren't afraid of having to put in effort to succeed, or of sometimes losing a run despite your best efforts, these negative reviews shouldn't dissuade you. The game is, in my experience, entirely free of the issues that would otherwise justify a negative review- no performance issues, all the systems function as intended, and the concept of the game is solid.
I would like to see a little more player control over the deck they assemble though. Especially the starting deck. I know this is somewhat antithetical to the genre (the rng is part of being a rogue-like), but setting out with the intention of building a deck around the 'shroom' mechanic, and then completing the run having never been given the option to take even one card related to 'shrooms' can be frustrating in an entirely different way than difficulty. You can already choose your leader and pet at the start of the run, except not really because the available leaders are three randomly generated options, and sometimes they'll all be bad, or just not what you want for your run, and there is no re-roll or quick-restart. This sort of complaint is easily remedied though- just a re-roll button, or 'build your own leader' option, and perhaps a few more systems that unlock more player choice as they progress (like the pets).",1.0

City Builder players who want a fun and relaxing casual experience. If you are looking to try this genre out for the first time, this is the perfect game for you as the entry barrier to learn the game isn't high. The game has a unique characteristic thanks to the art style, the narrator, and a few cute surprises you'll encounter along the way.

[b]How is the game's performance?[/b] 
Gameplay's smooth. It's not a game that requires 144 FPS, and isn't here to eat a lot of your computer's resources. No crashes ever since the game's release apart from the small texture issues. However, there's currently an issue with the game using 100% of your GPU. It's not an issue for everyone though.

[b]What are the devs like?[/b]
Like this game, the people behind it have the same characteristics. It's a pretty small team and they're vocal about the changes they want  to put in that are based out of data they gathered. 

[b]Would you recommend this game?[/b] 
Yes, specifically for the people who think they want something chill, casual, and fun to play especially if they need something in between their hardcore games. I've enjoyed the city building aspect so much.

Not yet for people who want tons of content.",1.0

The greatest parts I could not believe were that the majority of the games' region exclusivity differences, for example, in Battle Network 3, each version it's own differences and both also had an exclusive 'Navi Customizer' boot up screen, which used to be a Japanese exclusive ""cut-scene"". 
Overall, the first 3 games in the series are the more tedious and story-line driven games with similarities between them all. A very interesting start to the series but definitely not a bad entry to the Collection.

Additionally, it is inconvenient that the playing guitar button and head machine buttons are too far apart from each other when tuning.
Also, there is a bug where the character keeps moving if you press the W and A keys simultaneously and then release them.

2277,136784731.0,1934520,"I randomly came across this game, and as a massive fan of roguelikes and, more recently, survivor-likes, I found this one to look interesting. It was on sale, but the negative reviews warned of a horrific sounding mechanic where if too many enemies were on the map, your run just ends. Sounds counter-intuitive to this type of game. There was an update just recently where this mechanic was changed from outright killing you to immensely debuffing you instead. I decided to take the plunge with a 20% discount and try my luck.

I did not enjoy it. I couldn't get past the first boss, the first level, nothing. I'm not saying it's all the game's fault, but I found many frustrating, anti-gaming mechanics thrown in here that made little sense beyond packing the game in with frustration. You start off with a very slow firing, low damage bow that fires automatically. You'll get swarmed pretty quickly in this game. The balance of ramping up the amount of enemies versus your own power is very tipped towards the enemy. I found myself hitting the limits of this baffling horde mechanic in no time. Had I played the patch previous, I wouldn't have made it past the first minute in any run. Even with the change, this horde mechanic still helps stack the deck very much against you. I didn't see a reliable way of powering yourself up. The chests are random and may not give you what you need, the ""Sister Statues"" will only buff you if you take a debuff first or will add to the enemy count/decrease your max HP/other penelty if you don't take the blessing, and the first ""boss"" I encountered was a slime enemy that messes with your movement big time by causing the ground to be slippy and force you into obstacles and enemies against your will. It is abnormally easy to be surrounded and trapped against an obstacle, causing a quick and frustrating death. This all coalesces into a gaming experience that is not fun, at least in my eyes. 

Part of the charm of the survivor-like, at least for me, is the power ramp of your character. A bit of a peak of difficulty is expected, but only in line with your own power increase. Every mechanic in this game seems designed to build the difficulty wall and force you to scale it with almost no increase to your own power. It is supremely unfun. 

My last run, which was my best attempt at it, is what decided I was going to refund this. I was slipping around because of the slime boss, not having any real way to even get to it because there were so many enemies on the screen blocking it. These are enemies that will push you around, drain your health quickly, and all of that is multiplied due to the horde mechanic which will almost always be maxed out. I definitely tried seeking out chests, forges, sister statues for blessings (even if they hampered me further). I activated a statue which would give me a random blessing, but the trade off is that I had the slime debuff, on me (which I already had permanently because the slime boss was still alive) until I found a corresponding statue which was marked. I just decided to run there because any help I can get against this ridiculous tide of enemies that I had no real chance against I would take. But, for whatever reason, the framerate started plummeting. I somehow ended up at literally single digit frames where it would skip to a future frame maybe once every few seconds. I was able to pause and navigate the menu okay, but any graphical changes I would make did not help whatsoever (potentially not helped by the simple graphical options I had). My guess was that the mixture of amount of enemies densely pooled together caused the game to deteriorate. For reference, my computer has Intel i9-9900K processor, NVIDIA RTX 2070 Super, and 32 GB of RAM. I should not be experiencing such a thing.

So, the above has caused me to initiate a refund and share my negative experience. It is a shame, because I really like these types of games.",0.0

2283,136716571.0,1798020,"Okay, listen, I've been playing the Battle Network games for a little over a decade now, and I thought I'd basically experienced the peak version of Battle Network 5 with the Nintendo DS release, known as Double Team DS. I have my copies of BN3, 4, 5, and 6 on GBA as well, and even got the Bass icon on my BN5 save file so I could access Bass Cross on the DS version AND send over whatever the heck kind of folder I wanted to build from the GBA version of 5 to the DS one.

Let me tell you that all of that does not even compare to how shwacked the mod cards are for BN5 alone. Holy moly, I loaded up FireMan's card immediately because I love that guy and I get a Fire Arm Charge Shot AND a Heat Elemental affinity, complete with a new super rad color scheme to boot. I usually don't bother to get the Black Bomb R from the Purple Mystery Data in ACDC 2 until I've at least got the Hot Body chips at my disposal, but with the Fire Arm charge shot, I made that the first thing I beelined for in this new save file. It is BUSTED this early on AND there's a mod card section for items. Guess what's among them? BLACK BOMB Z. I have two, fucking TWO Black Bombs in my folder and I haven't even put ProtoMan in his place yet.

This is the most cathartic run of Battle Network 5 I've ever done and I have so many different ways I can now modify my play style. I loaded up a card with the Status Bug for a free 50/50 shot at either a temporary buff or debuff, which is normally something I have to bug my Navi Cust for with more than four colors, but now I just have that! I had experience with Mega Man Zero 3's mod cards before thanks to the Zero Collection on DS and the Zero/ZX Legacy Collection, but those pale in comparison to what's offered for the Battle Network games. Oh my god. I'm already making plans for my next Dark Soul playthrough of Team Colonel after I finish my current playthrough of Team ProtoMan.

Good lord, this is a whole new way to play some of my favorite RPGs of all time. I've already been juggling these games for roughly a year now on my DS, as the combat's so consistently satisfying to me that it never gets old or leads to burnout, but this pair of collections has reignited my passion for experimenting with loads of different folders and strategies. I haven't felt this close to combat nirvana since the first time I used the different Mod Codes in Battle Network 3's Navi Customizer all those years ago. KTEIUE2D, the Super Armor code, still remains embedded in my mind and I'm convinced it will remain there until the day I die.

So yeah, the collections fucking own. Play Battle Network 2, 3, or 6 as a starting point and go from there. 1 and 4 are super rough and I'd recommend at least having a foothold in the series before attempting them. 5's probably the hardest one, so while I love it to death, I can see it being a bit much for newcomers at first. Still damn good though. Absolutely give 5 a shot. God, I love Battle Network so much. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Wildfrost is a deep and engaging game that a lot of players seem to be approaching the wrong way.

[b] Forget everything you've come to expect from other Deck Buillders [/b]

Wildfrost leans heavy into the [i] Rogue Like [/i] side of things. Instead of building and perfecting a deck, you get a new hero every run that sort of decides what your build and run is going to end up as. Some heroes maybe  even end up being duds who end your run early, while others will end up synergising an insane deck that completely wrecks your opponents. Depending on which faction you pic, you do get access to cards and support heroes that are constant. As you play, you may get a random hero and immediately know which support cards will go with that particular hero and what you should look out for. And there's a lot to look out for. 

For one thing the game has a number system that counts down on individual cards and when the number reaches zero, those cards carry out their moves. So keeping watch on enemy cards and delaying cards as needed through mechanisms is important. You also need to watch for buffs and debuffs on both your team and the enemy team, and you gotta make sure you sub-out team mates to heal them! In fact, there's a lot going on at any given moment and you really have to play around a bit to pick up on all the games nuances. 

I'm surprised there are so many players calling Wilfrost unbalanced, when they have such little play time. And players saying that the game is ""too hard"" and ""unfair"" just because they can't kill a boss or two on the first try. Really dude?

This game rewards your time investment. There are unlocks, that help make the runs a little less RNG dependent and there are mechanics to learn that level you up as a player. A sort of meta progression if you will. 

I absolutely love Wildfrost. The art and presentation is stunning, the characters are so well designed and show off so much character for mostly static images and the game as a whole has a charm that makes me want to stay with it. I think it deserves way more than praise than it's getting. (Critically, the game is getting love online, but I think it deserves way more love on Steam)

I highly recommend Wildfrost, but I implore you to go into it with patience and an open mind.

[i] And devs, I'm all for you guys making tweaks as you feel fit, but please don't dumb down the difficulty or the core mechanics/ vision that you have for Wildfrost. There's a game on here called Souldiers, that a lot of players called out for being too difficult, so the devs for that game caved in and tweaked the difficulty to make it easier. This alienated the players that were actually enjoying the difficulty and now the game sits in Review-limbo. [/i]",1.0

2300,136717668.0,1811990,"The game is good, now on to the problems with it. 

- People complain that this game is like filing taxes. One wrong move and your entire life comes crumbling down, and half of the time you don't even know what you're doing. I consider this more of a skill issue since you guys do know you can move the position of your dudes every single turn right? There is no time limit, so you can adjust your dudes optimally. This is clearly designed to be a brutal game for some of the more hardcore roguelike fans. Also, for those of you who are confused with attack order, it starts from the front top, then the turn order moved down. It never goes sideways, unlike my life. 

- The deck can easily be bloated just like your mom. It's a known fact that having a smaller deck would make it more consistent, so this can be a problem. There is only one way to get rid of cards (through the Muncher) and you can only do that two at a time. I recommend allowing us to remove one card when in the shop for a fee. In the meantime, if you are not interested in adding new cards to your deck, I recommend going to charms whenever you have the chance. Another pro tip in the late game, you can pick frozen travelers and put them in reserve permanently. Who knows, maybe they might be better than what you currently have, or you can laugh at their face.

- The card pool is too polluted, just like the waters in Africa. There are a lot of cards, and I'm fairly sure half of them aren't tied to whatever faction you are at. Yet you only get 3 choices out of probably a couple of hundred in the pool, and some of them aren't even meant for synergizing (such as the one where it gives 4 gold after every kill, I mostly just use that as a blocking dummy if I had no real good choice). I do agree that it can be frustrating when you don't get the cards that help with your build. I propose that we should pick from a pool of 4 or 5, allow us to pay money to reroll, or maybe both if you're feeling merciful and lost your mind from all of these negative reviews. 

- The final boss. It's easy until it's not. Everyone who got there understands exactly what I mean. I personally wish to opt out of it and be severely punished for it someway somehow because I'm at a massive standstill right now. I wish I could build a deck that could counter it, but because of the previous problems I explained, the game relies a lot on luck to see if I pulled what I needed. In short, I have to be really lucky and find the synergy or I'm not... and trust me I'm not by default. 

In short, I hate myself in the best possible way. This game makes me feel pain in ways that I myself enjoy, but can't (and won't) explain to everyone else. That being said, I want all of my deaths to be my fault, and I don't want any outside forces that I can use as an excuse. I'm pretty sure everyone else feels like this in a way. 10/10

P.S: Why do people keep complaining about the cats when the hogs have annihilated me 12 out of 13 times. I counted.",1.0
2301,136789211.0,1922010,"[b]Summary:[/b]
It's simple, it's fun, but it's lacking in content.

Players mileage will vary depending on how much they like the competitive nature, local community and general game play. Personally I've gotten my money's worth during this and the beta play time. Encounters can become stale and samey after a while, with preset destructible locations leads players/traps to becoming kind of predictable.

[b]Visuals:[/b]
- Visuals are nothing to write home about, they're fine and suit the intended purpose. A lot of complaints about it, but nothing objectively terrible - just a whole lot of unrealistic entitled opinions. Personally, I appreciate being able to maintain a steady FPS on 120hz.  
- Clipping plane may need to be lowered for higher FOV headsets it seems, it's exploitable on the index and according to another comment may be worse on the Pimax.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]

- Movement is unrestrained and responsive to inputs unlike Pavlov with it's speed ramp/playspace movement kill system. It's simple, but it's fun.  
- Aiming feels smooth and doesn't lead to feeling outclassed by v-stock users, though have heard one player comment that they feel like controllers are being smoothed out too much tracking wise - but I haven't found issue with it. 
- The lean mechanic is under-appreciated by players, but is really neat piece of game design. Sometimes feels like a minor de-sync from player hit box though, in one extreme case a player put down their headset and visual mesh was completely disconnected from hit box location by about 2 meters. 
- Weapon mechanics (active reload) are non-existent for balancing purposes, but it kind of feels like a cop out - the frustration from waiting for an arbitrary cool down period to fire your gun after reload kind of sucks.
- Bullet penetration. It exists between players, but there's times that feel like you're registering limb damage instead of head/head. Unsure, but it was an concern that players block head shots due to hands in front of head.
- Balance wise there's many guns that feel lacking a purpose. The Auril & Urakan in particular stands out, Canutt is incredibly unreliable and Viper/RCB may need adjustment.
- Factory is the best map out of the three competitive maps visually and mechanically it just feels balanced design wise - perfect amount of long distance -> medium/short range encounters with each bomb site feels distinct.
Compared to hideout which feels almost too busy and bland with it's small rooms and winding corridors. Skyscraper, mixed thoughts - one pair of bombsites needs more accessibility for attackers imo.

[b]Sound:[/b]
- Sound is incredibly important in this game, a lot of players don't either have it up loud enough or lack game sense to distinguish friend from foe.
- Seems to be inconsistent across players, unsure why or if true but it's leading to a lot of frustration. My sound on 100% index, I can hear footsteps just fine. 
- Directionality needs work though. It's impossible to distinguish between up and down floors without relying on map knowledge for material sounds. 
- Spectators are able to heard sound anywhere on the map, which gives the dead players something to do - help track alive enemies and report positions to friendlies which is usually accurate to about a 4m radius. 
Which is fun for me and gives a purpose to dead team mates but feels like it needs to or will be removed. 
It brings on a lot of comments with people feeling like players have wall hacks, but that's more an issue with unskilled/uncoordinated pub matches. Ideally would like it to stay, but can see why it would go.  

[b]Wishlist:[/b]
- [u]Kill trade system/reduced bullet deletion[/u] - There's too many encounters where both players may land shots but one will register faster then the other leading to their shot being deleted. The problem with this is that blood effects play before the player loses control and dies, leading to frustrated players that know they have made the shot, know they saw blood
and accounting for weapon damage knows that should be an instant kill. This would also help cross regional play. From my experience it's frustrating enough with a 50 ping difference against equally skilled players. 
- [u]Player model clipping[/u] - Low priority but there's a lot of thin surfaces that players are resting against their model will clip through leading to them getting shot in the back through a wall. 
- [u]Ping markers[/u] on broken walls need to be fixed, allows spectators to identify what's been breached despite no visibility.
- [u]Bots[/u] get stuck at doors was a big issue before in the beta, seems like it may still be an issue. In general, they're super frustrating at times, aim locking you through walls and corners. 1 tap head shots at great distances, to not being able to kill a player within a meter. 
- [u]Toggle Grip - Vive Wands[/u] are vastly under-appreciated. For someone with re-occuring wrist problems, they're most comfortable controller for me to use. Having a hold to grip system makes them a no go. For comparison, I can't use a quest 2 or reverb G2 controller without major pain. Along with the reliability and input response make them preferable to knuckles. This issue is stopping users from purchasing the game and was requested back in beta to no avail.
- [u]Player moderation[/u] - It's understandable that devs wish to prevent player abuse, but not allowing players to moderate themselves in their local communities is frankly silly. 
This has lead to a lot of instances of player trolling with ping spam/flash bangs/FF/noise/camping, with no way to kick afk or people abusing glitches/bugs, or simply being abusive.
Having to record footage on the players end for ban reports on the discord, or using the in game system surely leads to an increase on dev time on mundane matters, no? - when players could simply kick and move on with their day.
- [b][u]Ping needs a separate audio control in options[/u][/b] - It's incredibly triggering and distracting. You can mute players to stop this, but if they're unconnected to the VC then they're free to spam. But alternatively you may want to chat with them just not hear the ping sound. They're frankly abrasive, a cool down wouldn't hurt either but mostly just want a mute.
- [u]Grenades[/u] feel like they need a better radial damage system. There are times players are within 1 meter but receive no damage, one instance of a player standing directly on top of the nade survived. Mostly just if it roles underneath some small gap, table or trolley it won't hurt an adjacent player. In particular ballistic room on Factory.
- [u]Local match recording/playback system[/u] - It feels like it may be scope creep at this point in time when more content is needed but there's too many times people call bullshit hacks. Post-game this would at least allow a player to re-wind and examine their mistakes.",1.0

2303,136715956.0,1772830,"I have not completed Rusted Moss yet, but I plan on getting further into it. So far, I am enjoying it but I do have some criticisms to lay out. 

What I enjoy about the game is the fast-paced action where you have to be careful how you proceed or the enemies will make quick work of you. The areas are very different from each other, and the accompanying music matches well which can be challenging for some games to do. As someone who loves an engaging plot with character development, I didn't find much of that here as the story was more in the background and not interesting enough to focus on. 

Where Rusted Moss lacks the most is in its controls and grappling hook ability. It's fun to be able to swing around and get to places quickly, as I could see professional speed runners putting their skills to the test here. The problem is if you aren't used to the feature it can be difficult to get through some areas. 

I often spent more time in one section trying to swing past some spikes than getting through the stage. It made the game less enjoyable and at times I wanted just to quit and do something else, like write this review to not get tired of being impaled.

I would give Rusted Moss a chance if you have not played it as it is fun, but the difficulty certainly should be modified which I would find hard to pull off since the level design would have to be changed. It's a game that succeeds in making a pixelated platformer that tries to be a Metroidvania, but gets stuck in its own mechanics like the grappling.",1.0

The grappling hook functions like elastic and these spaces play around a lot with the physics, but many ask for some hyper precise movement that is difficult to nail down consistently with how inherently chaotic such freeform mobility can be, there is little room for error in this basic traversal ultimately making it feel like a frustrating test of patience. I spent large chunks of time within singular rooms wrestling with the grapple trying to get it to behave just the way I needed it to in order to progress, sitting on the edge of my seat trying not to die and be sent rooms and rooms back to the checkpoint, which is not something I've ever experienced in a physics based platformer before. The pacing of upgrades is also incredibly odd, within the first thirty to forty-five minutes I picked up the basic grappling hook and a high jump, and those were the only movement upgrades I had received up until my final half hour. Everything in-between was either a passive effect or a weapon I could only find a niche use for. It was very refreshing to see a new mechanic and potentially loosen up some of the tighter platforming areas, but it was immediately made irrelevant by the next area where I was in zero gravity and at the whims of hazards that are made to force the player in different directions. I really wanted to like Rusted Moss, but I felt like I never got a good handle on the controls or stopped fighting with the game, and my aggravation led me to dropping it close to the finish line.

Good game.

Strong gun play, important mobility, interesting tactics.

Probably won't give too real a review until the game's actually in full release since it's been a WIP for a while now, and it's still a WIP. 

I recommend it, if only so I can have more folk to play with.",1.0
2338,136789872.0,1364020,"First and foremost I really really wanted to like this game. It has a very cool premise and the map design is super neat. Being able to move in every direction is something that not a lot of shooters do and it really adds a bit of complexity to finding enemies. Being able to see enemies moving the distance and around cover based on their thrusters is something you will have to learn and control as you try to sneak around or reposition around the battlefield. Cosmetics were neat but seem unfinished as their is a currency in the game but nothing to spend it on. The best part of the game is the fact that you can grab any weapon and go into a range to test it out quickly. Unfortunately that is where the good ends.

Guns and Classes are super unbalanced. The tank class offers no more survivability than other classes with the added negative of being the slowest class with the worst weapons. All the other classes play pretty much the same with the only real differences being the mobility items which either stop you in your tracks or give you a lot of speed, or the weapons which only makes a difference if you can't get a hold of the DMR or TK47 as those are far and wide the best guns in the game right now.

TTK and connection are inconsistent as there are only 3 servers currently and the game mashes everyone from the US, Europe, and Asia into the same servers constantly. I was constantly killed by people that had not appeared on my screen or in only 2-3 rounds after I had dumped 8-9 shots into them only getting hit markers, and that's if my bullets didn't simply pass through them. 

New players will be highly disadvantaged to the game as more people unlock better weapons and attachments as the lower tier attachments almost hinder your gameplay more than help. Sights are clunky and take up too much of your vision or are just plain unhelpful against the inky darkness of space. This serves to only push new players out of the game when they get repeatedly crushed by opponents that have access to better options that new players will have trouble unlocking because everything requires kills to unlock. 

Menus are good to look at but unhelpful and clunky. Selecting equipment shows no description of what it does beyond a few basic stats. Frequently guns would lose attachments between games and have to be re-edited after the match. Some attachments offer 0 upside while actively harming the guns stats. The path to unlocking attachments is long and take a lot of grinding against opponents that will be more deadly as the game goes on with little recourse to level the playing field other than picking the assault class and grinding out the TK47.

Respawn systems are also a weakpoint of the game as I was constantly trapped in a 2-3 spawn point cycle of getting gunned down by people sitting just outside of our spawn shooting us before our character would ready their weapon. 

Overall the game could use a lot of balancing changes to the weapons/classes to make them actually feel unique and balanced. Cluttering up some spaces so that snipers are not dominant and able to shoot from one spawn to the other. Progression system rebalancing so that new players are not locked out of weapon attachments for quite as long. Lastly better match making so that players can choose which server they would like to play on instead of getting pushed to a server that is far away and having massive ping in the process.",0.0
2339,136655883.0,1567000,"There have been a lot of retro-style shooters released in recent years. A lot of them have been disappointing or flatly bad. I've played many of them.

Even though I haven't played illWill for very long, I can confidently say that it's one of the BEST retro-style shooters to be released since the ""renaissance"" for this type of game started. The guns feel great to use. The enemy variety is really solid even just part of the way into the second level. The level design quality seems high without being overly complex. Looking at the screenshots and trailers there seems to be impressive variety in the design and aesthetics of the levels, and already the second level is much different from the first (this contrasts with a lot of old-school shooters that have overly similar levels). I'm also happy with how quickly the difficulty has increased in illWill. I've only tried ""Normal"" difficulty so far, but on this setting it's harder than plenty of retro-style shooters on ""Hard."" Finally, the game runs perfectly--there don't seem to be any performance or other significant technical problems, it's very smooth.

I just hope there's a good amount of content here, because so far, it seems unlikely that anything could be seriously wrong with this game unless it ends up being too short.

Btw I recommend turning on ""Infinite corpses"" in the options menu as long as it doesn't result in any technical problems.

Bottom line: This seems like a fantastic game. If you like retro-style shooters, BUY THIS. Hopefully some big reviewers will bring attention to illWill so that it enjoys the success it deserves.",1.0

Frogwares Sherlock Holmes series has been very hit or miss for me, with the previous title, Chapter One, being a miss in my opinion. The older version of Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened also didn't do it for me. I loved the story, but the game was too janky for me to truly enjoy it. Luckily then, that this remake delivers that same excellent story, expanded upon it, and delivers it with an entertaining gameplay loop for those who enjoy more narrative-driven puzzle adventure games.
Admittedly, the game is fairly easy and straight-forward. It didn't challenge my deductive reasoning skills as much as Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments did (in my opinion still the best Frogwares Sherlock Holmes game). It's also fairly linear, and the path forward is usually not difficult to figure out. But while the game is easy, it provides just enough of a challenge to never be boring.
The best part of this game is its narrative and presentation. This game oozes atmosphere, and the story is a compelling one. It often expands and improves on the narrative of the old The Awakened game, and even for people who played that version, this game's story will have some interesting surprises in store. Truly, it's one of the best Sherlock Holmes stories to date, and that is including the movies, TV series, and novels. But of course this game isn't just about Sherlock, it's also about the Cthulhu Mythos, and it doesn't disappoint in that area either. If you're looking for a great Lovecraftian story, this game has what you're looking for.

2349,136710627.0,1811990,"The game is fantastic, I sunk many hours in since purchase. It shows how fun it is. The game is straightforward with it's mechanics, and the cards are explained really well. There are 3 full unique factions that are easily unlockable right now. The art style and music are wonderful and add to the experience. The charms are my favorite part of the game, they add great synergies and give you the ability to craft unique cards!

Game is challenging enough to feel rewarding to win. And the progression of the game is exciting. Getting to fight against your own squad to win is ridiculous, hilarious, and can be a fun challenge.

Things that could be improved are adding even more variety. If you enjoy the game a lot at the release, some things can get a bit repetitive. But it's understandable at it's current state of the game. Also, I don't really like the pet mechanic (you get a first companion of your choice), because companion choices are very limited. I wish the first companion was also randomized after you choose your leader. Lastly, would be great to see 3 leaders of each faction as a choice. Because once you unlock all the factions, you get a randomized leader per faction, which can be limiting if you really enjoy playing only one of them. I felt much better about it before I unlocked factions, because I could choose 3 different leaders from starting faction. Other than that, it's a great game that I really recommend, and I hope it will only get better. 

This is my first review of the game ever. I can't help but notice lots of negative reviews. I think people forget how challenging roguelites can be. I do see the frustration element where one positioning mistake could quickly end your run. However, currently, I find the game well-balanced, and full of opportunities to explore broken synergies with companions, cards, and charms.",1.0
2350,136710890.0,1949030,"A better Lovecraftian tale than most.

[i]The Awakened[/i] tackles the collision between rationality and the irrational, and pits the man of deduction and reason against those things that destroy you when you come to know them. It's a great blueprint for a story, but the execution of such a high concept is difficult for even the best storytellers. Focusing in on this angle, on Sherlock Holmes' descent into madness as he tries to unravel his first big case alongside Watson, is the strongpoint of this remake; I haven't played the original but I feel like it wasn't an element there. The characters are endearing and the performances strong enough to sell their relationship - another improvement, as I understand - over the older series of games.

It's clear that Frogwares have evolved their craft, both that of telling Lovecraftian stories and of making Holmes games. With this one, they understand that they key to selling cosmic horror is not to portray it directly (as they did in the ambitious, but flawed [i]Sinking City[/i] - a game I rather loved, for all its faults). The key is to dance around the edges, revealing the minimal amount possible, skirting the line between mundane human cruelty and supernatural evil, until the characters (and hopefully the audience) start jumping at shadows. Holmes [i]can't[/i] be allowed to be certain either way if he's sane or mad, and the narrative sustains that ambiguity well.

The problems, I'd say, are the same ones Frogwares always has. The standardized investigation gameplay yields to easily to brute-force play, and the concept of the game deserved a grander budget and more time. It feels, at least, like the game could have benefited from a few more connective scenes here and there, an earlier setup for the final villain and more polished presentation of certain gameplay elements (like the shooting segments), so that it feels more natural and less on-rails. However, given that this game was made in the middle of a warzone, it's a stunning accomplishment as it stands.

I think the madness sections deserve special consideration. Narratively, they're great breaks in the game's pacing and are very good at setting up a sinister, unnerving atmosphere. I also love their game design. Very clearly they function with rules so violent and obscure that they might as well be madness (even though they *are* rules). That's a pretty elegant representation of the kind of stuff Lovecraft was talking about. They were really good sections and I only wish they had been better spread throughout the game. Maybe shorter, and added in a few more spots.

In the future I would like to see more involved and complicated deduction mechanics and better setup and characterization for supporting characters. Making the many outfits in the game actually relevant to the gameplay (as they were in [i]Chapter One[/i]) would also be nice. And, also, Frogwares, *please* go through one of these games without referencing Moriarty. We get it. He's out there. He even has an anime now. Stop trying to make him into an Marvel arch-villain.

I was very happy to support and play this game. I may have been critical in my review but it's still Frogwares at their finest. I look forward to seeing what other games they make when this war is over.

The game itself has its moments where it can be super fun but then once you play enough youll started getting into ""sweat"" lobbies...players who have the most OP operators completely leveled up and skills trees grandfathered in from the old MTX p2w system. But they recently change their whole MTX system so thats cool. 

If you're a new player, your best bet is to look for guides on some OP operators to compete with in game.

Operators can cost anywhere from 100k to 200k, of course the good/most picked operators being 200k. So be sure to do your research on how good that operator is. 

In order to play ranked you need 3 Operators OF THE SAME CLASS, meaning you need 3 assaults or 3 snipers, etc. That alone will cost you half a million coins, a little more-or-less depending on the Ops. After you get those 3 operators you need to level those operators, a level 15 operators will cost you 156,000 credits along with experience points, which is basically another currency. Once you do that 3 times youll be able to play that ONE role in ranked. 

Oh WAIT I forgot Skills...

Each operator can have 4 passive skills to help them perform better. Now...how do you get those skills? EACH operator in the game gives you one of those skills...after you level that operator up. Thats another 200,000 Minimum.

SO this means if you want some skills that are considered good, you will need to buy the corresponding operator and level that operator up to unlock that skill he gives. So if a skill you want is on an operator that really isnt good, you still have to level that operator to get the skill to put on your main operators. 

I ran some numbers, for 4 skills that are considered competitive, it will cost you roughly 650,000 credits. 

Another issue I have is with the Battlepass...

This game introduces some VERY strong operators behind a paywall, which is why people say its P2W. It is a VERY VALID point people make. In order to get access to the newer ops you NEED to buy the battlepass, if you chose not to, then that operator will not be available for that season AND THE NEXT SEASON. That's TWO whole seasons in which the OP operators will be unavailable to non paying players.

However, the game almost feels like a puzzle in that sense, you are attempting to figure out how to tackle the weaknesses in your deck, 'Should you cycle your companion, or wait for just oooonee more hit?', 'Should you put the Play it for Free charm on a an item and be able to increase your coverage or on a companion and allow you to cycle their health faster?', '[spoiler] Should I buff my companions/hero with a charm, knowing that if this run is successful the shade will possess them, or should I put it on an item and hope that I cycle into it enough during combat to keep my squishes? [/spoiler]'. These are the kind of decisions I stick around for and enjoy.

The main issue I had with the game is once you've unlocked everything (excluding all the achievement charms as I haven't gotten there), it doesn't feel like there's tooooo much there and some charms are so specific that having gone out of your way to get a charm or buying them for 50 feels like a punishment. Hopefully, in the future, there will be a content patch to add more stuff and probably tweak the balance as the community has been saying.

2423,136683935.0,1183800,"TLDR: An excellent roguelike featuring turn-based tactical combat in the style of XCOM that mixes in elements from Darkest Dungeon (Eg. Camping Skills). I would recommend Shardpunk: Verminfall to anyone that enjoys or is looking to get into this particular genre of games - especially at this price point. 

Having just finished my first successful run on normal, which I binged over the course of 9 hours, I have to say that it's quite the compact yet fairly polished experience. The core combat loop is extremely enjoyable and is fairly similar to XCOM in this regards, where good positioning and target priority is highly rewarded. This is complimented by an excellent soundscape and a banger OST, which creates a wonderful atmosphere of perpetual tension — which really comes to forefront in the lulls between combat encounters. 

The game, much to my surprise, also has an excellent tutorial stage. To someone who is new to the genre, it does a good job of bringing the player up to speed on the key game systems and guiding them on how they actually work in practice by introducing important complexities - such as how Weapon Heat interacts with Overwatch. As such, the tutorial is quite useful for veterans of the genre as well, as it clearly explains and demonstrates mechanics which either iterate on the X-COM formula or a simply brand new (Ohhh Looting Spree my beloved)

Whilst I could go on at length about how I enjoyed all these iterations/additions to the X-COM formula, the sheer excitement and/or panic that I experienced when I interacted with them for the first-time is something I highly recommend that you experience yourself.

That being said, I really like CK so I knew he could make a decent game and that was enough to convince me to spend the money to give the game a chance.

1) Technically the game is fine with the notable exception of the sex scene that wasn't because when I clicked on Yes for manual control, it went by so quickly (and I don't mean the scene was short. I mean it was like somebody hit fast forward and the pages zipped by) that it was basically over before it started. A bit like losing your virginity. 

2) The graphics are fine. Nothing much to say one way or the other. 

3) The writing. This game tries to be serious and funny and doesn't succeed at either one. The MC is whiny and inept, but can suddenly transform into super smooth once you figure out the secret formula (and you will because it's a trope, and a bad one at that).  Your friends seem to exist for no reason other than to further highlight said ineptitude. Most AVNs, or at least the ones I've played, are mindless lighthearted sex romps. Some actually have a little bit of a plot that works in between sex scenes. Some have the potential for a good plot depending on how it develops. Unscripted is none of these.

My only problem compared to monster train is runs feel a lot shorter and you dont get as many upgrades. Which doesnt feel as fun to make a powerful deck.

Great things the game does:

When you beat the game your team that beat the game becomes the new end boss for the next run. Amazing because you have to plan your new run on countering your old broken team. Very strategic.

Random starting hero card. So cool rolling the dice and getting a new hero every time.

Bad stuff is RNG can end runs early because you die on like the first boss. Even many runs in this still sometimes happens for me. 

Some enemies are too strong, I hope to get some easy encounters and dread getting others. And a bug for developers to fix, rng ended a run just now where an enemy card had a teeth modifier charm, but the text didnt show up on the card because it already had a full card of text.

All my guys attacked the teeth charm card and died, and I obviously wasnt given a warning in text only the small little charm in the bottom left. Text needs to be scaleable so if it runs off the card it will just put the front smaller to show up on the card.

I will agree with some of the other reviewers on the biggest thing wrong with this game is the balance. There are some archetypes that just aren't viable and that hurts the replayability because it feels like you either build the same couple runs or lose. However, that will come with time.

2506,136682386.0,1798010,"This review will cover both volumes of the collection. I am reviewing as a newcomer to the series.

I'm going to start by going over the part that isn't the games themselves: The main menu stuff. Right off the bat you're introduced to a fully voice acted Mega Man.exe who will greet you. There does not appear to be any sort of subtitles option in the release version of the collections, so if you switch the language to one you don't understand you might not get the full benefit of the change in voice actor. Mega Man will greet you every time you boot up the game, and from what I have heard he will even sometimes have different things to say based on the time of day. There's an interact button if you want to make him talk, although the pool of things he has to say doesn't appear to be very large. I so far cannot confirm whether he gains more things to say as you progress in the games. He's overall nothing too complex, but he's a harmless inclusion. If you want him to be quiet, you can also just simply mute him. Pre-orders received cosmetic skins for him, they do nothing other than change his appearance slightly and give him some minor new dialogue. They do not apply to the in-game look, only the main menu.

In regards to other main menu features, it's comparable to the Zero/ZX collection released in 2020. Unlike collections prior to Zero/ZX, there doesn't appear to be any merchandise you can look at or trailers to watch. There's an option to download battle chips, which appears to only work once per save file per game. Volume 2 seems to have a lot more right off the bat. Depending on which volume you're playing at the moment you can listen to the various music from each game and even set one to play as the main menu music, and you have a gallery of artwork based on the games in the volume you're currently in.

As for the games themselves, a noteworthy change compared to previous collections is that entering the collection settings menu doesn't pause the in-game music. I don't really know anything about the content compared to the original releases, but I do know that there's a new font being used for text. There's a filter you can toggle on and off, though the CRT filter of previous collections is missing. It's not really missed in my opinion. With the filter on, there appears to still be stray elements here and there that remain unfiltered, and with the filter off there's still some things that are smoothed out such as certain text elements. It's generally not a big deal, though if you prefer the filter on for some reason you might be annoyed by how many pixels are still visible.

Like previous collections you can choose a border to occupy the space outside of the original aspect ratio. Noteworthy however is the apparent lack of an option to disable borders entirely. If you like having black borders surrounding your retro games instead of stylized artwork, that sadly doesn't seem to be possible here as far as I can tell. You can also choose what size to display the game at on screen. There's small, medium, large, and largest. Largest is as close to full screen as you can get. Testing at 1080p appears to preserve pixel scaling regardless of in-game screen size settings, so you don't have to worry about any misshapen pixels. However, I have heard reports of alternative monitor resolutions not producing perfect pixel scaling. This issue does generally seem to be easier to solve than previous collections however.

A noteworthy inclusion is the new Buster Max mode. This can be toggled both while you are on the main menu and in the collection settings menu in-game at any time. It changes your standard buster attack to do 100 points of damage, trivializing encounters. You can use this as a sort of easy mode, as a way to speed up grinding, or just generally as you see fit. The collection does not punish you for using this in any way, even in regards to achievement collection. It's up to you to decide whether you want to use it or not.

Unfortunately as a newcomer to the series, I don't have much to comment on regarding content inclusions for each game. My understanding is that almost all of the content for each game is here including previously Japanese exclusive content, however my knowledge is limited to the pre-release marketing as I have never played these games before now. I am aware of a new online component regarding trading/battling with other players, but I have not used this feature yet personally.

Overall, the collection doesn't seem to disappoint. It's exactly what it seems to be, and has pretty much everything you could want from such a collection. I'd recommend saving up for the bundle with both volumes and/or waiting for a sale. While I do feel as though the content offered here is worth the release price, I also understand that many people might not be able to afford it at that price. That's okay, don't feel pressured to impulse buy here if it's looking like a bit much for you.",1.0

2508,136683315.0,1798010,"Besides the stupid Denuvo DRM, the game runs pretty smooth with no issues. 

Here you have a collection of battle network games from 1-3, and it seems like the trophys are linked for all 3 games instead of it separately... I'm personally going for a 100% completion which means I have to play it more than once. 

The menus are clean and simple as you are greeted with a Modren 3D model of Megan.exe with the original voice actor from the anime... There is different language options and changing your language does change the logos of the games which is cool but it's still the same game don't be confused that it's some ""different version"" or anything just because of the logo change for another language. 

In terms of gameplay there isn't anything new, it's basically the same gameplay from the GBA games.

Was is new however is buster MAX mode that allows you to do 100x the damage of your normal buster shot, which is EXTREMELY helpful especially for the first game that doesn't have an escape button.... I don't think I have to remind everyone here how much of a labyrinth structure MESS the first game's internet areas are... And because they are a mess you keep running into enemies that without the escape chip your forced to fight, every, single, TIME... But thanks to Buster MAX mode you can make quick work of this mess. It also doesn't effect trophys, so go ahead and use it if you get stuck, it makes grinding for chips and zennys easier too. 

Extra features include the exclusive battle network Japanese only chips that you can immediately download and use at the start of the game.... they are very overpowered in the early game but if you think you feel guilty about using them early don't..... these games spike up in difficulty. There is also the Japanese only 499 patch cards they added but those are separate from these battle chips and you won't be able to use those until Mega Man Battle Network 4 which is in collection 2. 

Capcom also added online fighting and online trading to all the games, I haven't tested these features yet as it's still pretty early for people to be using it. 

There is a HD filter that makes it less pixelated, in my opinion it looks fine and does make it easier on the eyes but that's just me. 

You can also have different custom borders, which is a neat little addition. 

And then you have the usual MegaMan Collection stuff with the art galleries and music players.... You can actually run as specific music piece to play as your main menu theme though so that's nice. 

Overall your getting a lot of bang for your buck here, definitely recommend getting it.",1.0

2514,136713689.0,307950,"Game feels great but being a slow paced TPS game, this is a game of ""peekaboo"", which means everyone and their moms are hiding behind cover and using Third Person view to check for enemies.

Another problem is classes' weapons, in other shooter games, all ""classes"" have weapons that doesn't make them useless, here some operators just have bad weapons and you can't do a thing with it, there is a reason why Medics and Marksman are never used while in other shooters they're always filled first, their weapons SUCKS, marksman in special, they have no option to change to another main weapon so your best bet is either the VSS or a DMR with high fire rate because most ""snipers"" don't kill on headshot and because of that, you're always looking for at least 2 shots to kill people.

Some small problems would be progression, like, you need to play a lot with your operator to ""level him up"" and then unlock passive/talents to bulk him up, you pay an in-game currency for that, I reckon that it should take quite some time (maybe 8~20 hours?) of playtime with an operator to fully unlock him...and then unlock other operators to use their passive on other operators too...in any case, I don't feel like this one is a major problem because it adds progression to the game.

In any case, this game is a hard pass, specially if you're not into TPS shooters, if it were an FPS game then the slow paced combat and the need of awareness would definetely make this a good game, as of now, I can't recommend it to anyone.",0.0
2515,136657215.0,1364020,"- 5v5 matches

- Character classes

- You start out with basic weapons and iron sights. All other weapons and attachments are locked behind scoring dozens or hundreds of kills.

- Movement is a bit slow. This isn't going to scratch the Titanfall or Tribes itch. 

- Seems mechanically sound aside from some issues like roll being slow. 

- MTX, Battle passes, fortnite style funny skins, like the tiger mascot space suit that early backers unlock

- Mechanics are easy to learn if you've done any 6DOF movement game. It took me all of ten minutes and half of that was re-binding keys. If you haven't played 6DOF games before it might be harder to learn, but you shouldn't let it intimidate you. Remember that the enemy gate is down and you'll be fine. 

I wish their was a ""meh"" option instead of yes or no. If you're looking for something different from Fortnite and CoD and CS:GO, and you don't mind grinding for hours to unlock red dot sights, I'd say it's worth checking out, but it's not a strong endorsement. I'm put off by the small teams, the small maps, the inclusion of sniper rifles (in a 6DOF game snipers can go anywhere in the play volume, making them much more frustrating to deal with than in flat games), and the requirement to grind for weapons and equipment in a small team competitive game.",1.0

Music - noticeable loop transition and not very noticable - muted it after 10 minutes of idling.
Gameplay wise it isn't much of an experience, comparable to someone's first text-based weeklong HTML incremental, sadly. This is the main thing holding this back.

I held on after the 2 hour mark just hoping to see something happen but it's just ""numbers go up"" in the most unsatisfying literal sense. Meh.",0.0

I can't believe they released a game without testing. I guess money is more important. + no market research whatsoever. Why release a game on the same time as a bigger studio's hyped beta? The playercount dropped by 22k.  And why release it with so many fucking bugs.

Plus, this game should be free to play with battle-pass and cosmetics. It is not designed to be a paid game, but again, short-term money is more important. If the game stays paid, it will struggle to lift-off (no pun intended).

2535,136655107.0,1364020,"Hello so here is my review. The game has some issues that I'm going to address really quick. The settings has no FOV slider and you cannot edit or customize your in game UI like the mini-map's position. They also have a server issue that I encountered as I was trying to start a match play and just left the game to fix it. Another issue I saw was that your username doesn't show and instead shows the in game names that are random to a degree. Gun customize is very good but feels as tho in certain areas its lacking in the parts and guns. Tilting is slow and needs to be tweaked just a little bit faster in my opinion but others may think otherwise. With all this I still suggest the game and give it a positive review. The reason being is because compare to many other early access, this game is pretty spot on even when I played it in alpha. Gun plays good, movement is good, concept is good, and it gives the itch and customization I'm looking for. I think with a little more time over this year until its full release it can upgrade and add more things as its open to the devs to listen to community and try there best to keep it going. It will need content if they want this game to survive. Eventually they will have ranked but they don't as of currently. I think this game is worth a try and just needs support and feedback as it grows during early access.",1.0

2546,136655586.0,2357670,"Fourteen Fiends! I played this new game and enjoyed the fast paced, card game style RPG almost?? I think its pretty cool that the game ""helps"" you by allowing you to know which of your cards may win the battle vs an enemy, but the system also allows you to do your own strategy, by using item cards you acquire throughout battles and purchasing from the merchant, a very greedy man indeed. I like it when I am completely lost in the game by just testing it out on the first run, I prefer learning by trial and error, and this game takes about two tries til you are getting the hang of the mechanics and beginning to create strategies of your own, of course there are some flaws, like the merchant being greedy and perhaps a little ""math"", but i think that is positive since nowadays too many game hold your hands, anyways...

2553,136714065.0,"1798010,1798020","Its exactly what it claims to be: Its a legacy collection of the MMBN games. Its not a remaster, its not a remake, its all of the games in two packages. They give you extra goodies like artwork, music player, and other things, but please don't go into this assuming its going to be some upgraded reboot with crazy HD features. They never promised that. If you enjoyed MMBN (I definitely did), you'll enjoy this. If you didn't like the MMBN games, you wont enjoy this, Also, its best to play this game with controller. Some people complained about the lack of remappable controls, but I maybe I'm too much of a causal to care. I play most games with controller anyways, especially 2D games. 

The ONLY thing that I don't like about this collection is the Buster Max mode. Its too OP of a option and I hate having the option to take an easy route in games. Id rather the temptation not be there, But considering that its an optional option (Im using that word ""option"" as if I have no other word options), I'm going to keep it turned off. Buster Max will take away the fun of the game for me, but its good for if you revisit areas that you already beat and want to look for any loot you missed without dealing with battles. You also don't want to use Buster Max if you plan on playing online unless you are already a master at the game, otherwise, you wont understand the mechanics of the game and all of the cards and your skills are going to atrophy. You will get deleted like an ""I'm sorry"" text to your ex. 

Overall: Get it! Its really fun! But try not to use Buster Max except for grinding. Play the game the way it was originally meant to be played and you'll have a blasty blast. :)",1.0

Not only that but there are achievements for each version of the game (such as one for completing mmbn5 colonel and another for mmbn5 protoman).

2560,136679263.0,1968710,"I'm not gonna recommend this game. I'm sure people will enjoy it, but for a fully released game, I don't believe there is enough content here to justify its $10 pre-sale price tag. As much as I like the concept, I believe it is held back by a few factors: 
1. The weapon variety isn't fleshed out enough. I think that 4 weapons is good, but the weapons themselves (besides the rocket launcher) didn't bring me to try different playstyles. The minigun is essentially a faster firing pistol, and the shotgun is typically the best gun for most situations.
2. Level design. Aside from a few levels, they mostly play the same. All trucks are the same size, all cars are cars, It would've been cool to use bits of the environment more as a way to navigate. The enemy placement is another thing, and is noticed towards the end especially. They tend to be spread out or condensed, but the AI doesn't like the latter so they tend to trickle towards you unless you rush in.
3. Movement. The movement is fine, and I don't want to compare this to ultrakill too much, but for a game that is all about fast paced movement, it is really difficult to keep up momentum. The only truly fast way of moving is the grapplehook, which stops you at its point. Dashing out of it still loses that momentum. It would have been nice if movement focused on that momentum that surges you forward, since the game forces you to move ahead.
4. Enemies. There is little enemy variety. When combined with weird placement, it feels as though there are no challenges. In my game, the #1 reason I died was the tunnel level, where signs and pipes instakill you. They also kill all of the enemies, so it just becomes ""run forward and dodge."" It would have been nice to see enemies have to be taken out in different ways. Melee enemies are always killed in a kick, but what if they could block it or counter? I never really felt endangered in my time to just run into a group of melee guys and kick them. 
5. Time. It took me 39 minutes to beat the ""main game."" And while yes, there is infinite mode, that is just not for me. I kept expecting as I played through the game that there would be some big moment, something that would test my skills toward the end. Instead, it tests whether you remember to use your grappling hook. It left a sour taste in my mouth. 

To Conclude, it's not a bad game, but because of the factors I mentioned above, I cannot recommend it in its current state. As much as I dislike early access, this game should be labeled it. It doesn't feel like a fully released game, with nominative amount of content for its price. This game ends with a cliffhanger stating that it will be continued, but that isn't enough for me to recommend it. Just because I do not recommend it does not mean it is a bad game, there is probably something there for people, but not for me. 

P.S. for the devs
If you want to improve this game, please prove that it is not a unity asset flip by continuing development. Go beyond being a copy of the clustertruck formula. There's a lot more I could say, but I'll just leave as this: prove me wrong.",0.0

The PvE is absolute garbage, nothing salvagable there, unless the last unlock is good, but I wont be playing anymore to unlock that mode. First mode the missions are shitty voice acted, terribly boring missions that last 10 minutes, one of them at least has the worse boss fight ive ever seen in any shooter I've ever played. Do yourself a favor and stear clear.

PvP is alright, I would play only PvP if I were you, however, prepare to realise you are at a significant disadvantage until you level up your operators, as they get more hp, armor, improved abilities and up to 4 traits at later levels. You can compete, and even win, but you are fighting uphill against players much better equiped than you.

The PvPvE mode Frontline is the only actually good thing about this game I would say, its interesting at least for a couple hours, it gets boring fast, but I can see someone play this game just for that.

Graphics are fine, nothing to write home about
Sound design is just... either missing or just minimum denominator, lazy voice acting, boring gun sounds, I've never been bored firing an SMG in a game, but I sure am here.
Animations are passable, they arent horrible, but you can see some jank

Although managing the group becomes quite a problem after a while I would imagine. It is turn based and you can have 20+? people controlled at once. In single player that certainly sounds excessive, but in co-op it is fine. But late game even in co-op this will become a problem most likely.

Also, I wish there were more camp events, certain companions would form rivalries etc. as they do in Wildermyth but that isn't really in this, you have relationship +1/-1 and thats it, doesnt do much in terms of group dynamic or anything. Or like in XCOM or rimworld where if a character dies in combat it negatively impacts the other people, if they liked the person or positively impacts if they hated the guy or something like that. Needs more flavour events

Also people dying isnt end of the world so I would recommend not save scumming, if somebody dies they die. Sad event but you move on and hire new people, great stuff. Rest in peace Sibric",1.0

This game is about half as long as Chapter One was, even if you do every optional case. That by itself is disappointing, but the story is also really lackluster.

A Lovecraftian story needs to have unexplainable cosmic horror. A Sherlock Holmes story, meanwhile, need to have every mystery explained in impressive detail. So a Lovecraft story where Holmes is the protagonist can't have both; it has to pick one. Either Cthulhu is real, or Sherlock figures out that it was just a squid-shaped hot air balloon that was part of some plan to steal the crown jewels and murder the butler. Frogwares, bizarrely, chose the option of ""neither"". Nothing truly unexplainable happens, and Sherlock never wraps up the mystery.

Three times in the game Sherlock has hallucinations of some alien landscape where he has to solve some (trivially easy) puzzle to get out. Despite there being multiple obvious explanations for the visions, namely that he was drugged and envisioned landscapes that were implanted into him subliminally by all the bizarre paintings hung around the bad guys' lairs. Sherlock suggests that the visions are caused by drugs a few times, but inexplicably dismisses the idea as if it weren't less ridiculous than many of his other deductions in the games (and books). But for some reason, this causes Holmes' sanity to completely unravel. It's like Frogwares wanted to go full-Lovecraft with the story, but didn't have the guts to pull the trigger and have an actual eldritch abomination show up. I know they were somewhat tied to the plot of the original game, but why stick with the original plot when they rebuilt everything else?

Thankfully, there's multiple murder mysteries you get to solve along the way. Unfortunately, they don't get the attention they deserve. The worst example is in the insane asylum when you find the director dead after discovering all the horrible things she was doing to inmates. You examine the body, and then without even determining the killer he's like ""we got what we need, let's get out of here"". It's implied that it was Gerda who killed the director, but since when has a Sherlock Holmes murder been so straightforward? It was such a wasted opportunity for a murder case in an insane asylum. And the game's short length could have used the help.

And on top of all that, the mystery-solving segments are all pretty easy. The most challenging part of them is figuring out what you can interact with (I played on the hard setting where they can't be highlighted). Everything basically falls into place after you find everything to interact with, and the mind palace portions can be easily cheesed by just spamming all your evidence into the equation until something sticks. It's a LOT less challenging than Chapter One was.

2633,136659440.0,2328760,"This review is coming from someone who has no history with Pinball or Pinball FX3!

I'm happy to see this finally make its debut on Steam (after a year of Epic Games exclusivity)! As a newbie to the Pinball scene, I'd say this is a nice entry. You get a few free tables to start with and then can purchase more tables as DLC; this business model of free game + DLCs makes sense as I doubt they could encase every licensed DLC within a single (reasonable) price, and still make it profitable.

The big elephant in the room is that previously, players could transfer their DLCs from Pinball FX2 to Pinball FX3 for free, as those two games ran on the same engine, and thus, there was basically no labour involved to move assets from one entry to another. The problem here is that this title makes the jump to the Unreal Engine, and thus, porting the older tables to this newer game required the devs to do manual work. As such, they're now charging again for these tables, whereas loyal fans are conditioned to expect to be able to transfer their previously purchased tables for free, as they have been able to before. This isn't a problem for new players, but again, fans who have purchased tables before are disappointed.

As an outsider looking in, I can understand the frustration; it can be debated whether the graphics were even improved, and thus, whether it worth jumping to a new engine or not in the first place. People don't want to pay for what's essentially same thing twice. On the other hand, I've seen multiple players act as though they MUST purchase the new DLCs. It's not like you're losing access to the tables you purchased 5+ years ago, those are still accessible in the phenomenal Pinball FX3, thankfully. I think expecting DLCs to be transferable isn't necessarily the norm in the gaming industry, so it's unfortunate that Zen Studios have put themselves in this situation where it's expected of them now. The DLC bundles that offer a discount for those who already own the tables from older games are a nice middle-ground, but not one everyone is satisfied with. I'm not sure what an alternative could be.

I also think the optimization / performance of this game is a bit questionable. I have to play on lowest settings at 720p to reach 60 FPS on my Steam Deck, which is a bit of a bummer. Perhaps this can be ironed out down the line via updates.

As for the game itself, it's Pinball! Lots of tables to checkout, with flashy effects and addictive sound design. I think if you're a newcomer, you'll really enjoy this game (provided you're willing to purchase / rent tables), but if you're a long-time fan, you may only have interest in this game's exclusive tables, and otherwise, you'll likely want to stick to FX3. If previous DLCs were transferable, I'm sure this game would have a much better review score. That's the biggest contention point.",1.0

2636,136657493.0,1091920,"Plantera 2: Golden Acorn is a sequel to the popular farming and idle game, Plantera. It is a relaxing and engaging game where you grow and manage your own garden. The game has colorful and detailed graphics, pleasant music, and simple controls, making it easy to pick up and play.

In this game, your main objective is to collect Golden Acorns that come from the oak tree. These acorns can be used to unlock new features and upgrades. You start with a small garden and gradually expand it by planting various crops and trees and placing decorations. As you progress, you'll encounter different types of crops and animals, each with their own unique characteristics and requirements.

The game also features unwelcome guests like moles, crows, rabbits, and even a UFO, which can eat your crops or dig up your garden, causing damage and reducing your Golden Acorn production. However, you can protect your garden by clicking on them, hiring guard dogs, bees, and scarecrows to chase them away.

Plantera 2: Golden Acorn is a well-designed and enjoyable idle game that provides a relaxing experience. With its fun and engaging gameplay, the ability to expand your garden, and protect it from unwelcome guests, the game is definitely worth playing.

2639,136657415.0,2198070,"This review was written by someone who is somewhat into many game genres, though not very relevant to this genre. I would like to list the important parts that I see in the game without any distinction between positives and negatives. (So ​​you can decide for yourself <3)

- I want to start with the gameplay time. I'm playing the game incredibly slow in a really chill mode. That's why I haven't seen every card and event in the game even though it's been over 8 hours. Therefore, based on the comments made to see all the cards, we can say that it has a gameplay of 8-10 hours. (For the early access version. And this period will be extended with new cards and events to come as long as it stays in early access.)

- Our goal in the game is to create a city based on random cards from our deck. And while doing so, it's important to keep your citizens happy. At this point, we come to the importance of balance. A difficult objective card (the red ones) at the beginning of the game can make your game really difficult as the cards come randomly. But since we depend on a few conditions to lose the game, we can say that the structure is balanced at this point. (At the beginning level of the game, the objective cards can be very difficult. But as you continue playing in a short time, the bonuses gained make this difficulty more bearable.)

- There are troubles, disasters and festivals as random events in the game. Since these are subject to a certain condition, we can slow down or speed up their arrival. I think these random events are enough for the early access phase and add excitement to the game. For example, we can lose our important buildings in case of an earthquake, or we can turn all the cards we draw into road cards with a new feature. (Come on, who likes a leader who doesn't make some road?)

- The map size did not satisfy me. In fact, the game needs to have a more appropriately sized map than it currently has. A map that is too small will not be large enough to accommodate game content. On the other hand, a very large map may show less content than it actually is. I think this needs improvement.

- I think that the small cosmetics on the table other than our game board are enough for now. Definitely an in-game currency and store should come. Or, if additional packages are to be made for the game, such cosmetics should be added to them. (But these will definitely be reserved for the full version of the game and will have no effect on gameplay.)

- Thank you for taking time to read my review. I hope this helped you to get a little idea about the game. Have fun in your Cardboard Town my friend <3",1.0

Before getting to that though, I'm just going to start with my opinion: yes I recommend it, but I'm a MMBN fan so of course I would say that, I want people to get this game so that Capcom could see this be popular and make a new game, so the rest of this review is just trying to be informative. 

Part 1: For New People

The Mega Man Battle Network games were a collection of action RPGs (mostly) for the GBA games. This collection and the simultaneously released Vol 2 contain all of the 6 numbered entries (all except the first two entries were split into 2 versions like Pokemon, hence the ""10 games"" in marketing). This collection contains the first 3, and vol. 2 contains 4-6.

The gameplay is a little difficult to describe. Combat takes place on a 6x3 grid, where the left 3x3 is where you can move around, and the right 3x3 is where your enemies can move. 5 battle chips are drawn from your deck of 30, which you select based on shared letter (think ""suit"" of card) and shared chip type. You battle for 9 seconds, where you can move on the grid, use your chips, and/or your (relatively weak) megabuster.  after which you can choose to return to chip selection, and repeat until the enemy is defeated.  This system is expanded upon as the game goes on and becomes increasingly nuanced and complex (the final entry supports a robust PvP meta, for example), but these basics are upheld. 

This system would later go on to inspire One Step from Eden. Unlike One Step from Eden, however, this game isn't a rougelike. There is a set story, involving Lan Hikari in the real world, who operates Mega Man.exe, his Net Navi, in the cyberworld, in their fight against viruses and a (game-dependent) terrorist organization. Generally Lan moves in the real world, finds a place for Mega Man to ""jack-in"" and enter either a local network or the internet. On the internet, battles come from in the form of random encounters.

The game's stories aren't really their strong point. It is mostly typical shounen fare, often hindered by awkward localization with numerous typos (particularly in BN 4). Most of the fun is derived from improving your chip folder and skills as you fight ever stronger navis. The games have a lot of mechanical depth, particularly the later entries, which lets players spend a lot time tinkering with folder set-up.

In general, 1 and 4 are considered to be the weakest games. 1 is janky in the way that first entries often are, and 4 suffers from a series of poor design decisions and a particularly atrocious translation effort. 3 and 6 are generally considered the highlights. 3 for its post-game and varied settings, and 6 for its gameplay and PvP. Playing the games in order is recommended, but if you aren't enjoying 1, you can try skipping to 6 to see if the series is for you at all. Or 3 if you only have this collection. Speaking of which, this bundle is $40 for the first 3 games, and the other is also $40, but you can get both for $60 if you get the bundle, which you probably should if you think you'll like these games.

Some tips:
1) Buster Max mode is basically a ""cheat"" mode that puts your base buster power to 100 and can let you breeze through the games. Keep this in mind if this is something you are interested in, even if just for speeding up grinding.
2) If you are struggling and don't want to resort to the above, try reducing the number of letter codes in your folder. Putting a bunch of powerful chips is great and all, butt if you are only getting one chip each turn, you are going to be much less effective.
3) The Rockman Exe Zone has a very helpful wiki that is well organized if you ever want to consult a resource.

Part 2: For Everyone

This collection has added online support with a (simplistic) ranked system for battling other players. Not all of the games are balanced, but 6 in particular is balanced in a way which has lead a competitive scene existing for it (and has had decent-sized following for several years now). I expect that to continue in this collection once people have gotten themselves solid collections of chips to participate in it.

Also new to the collection are the ability to gain ""download chips"" which were Japanese only event chips at a press of a button. Similarly, one can use ""patch cards"" which were Japanese-only E-reader cards which were used for a variety of things. Mega Man is also voiced in the title screen, and will have a variety of things to say depending on the circumstances when playing the game. You can look at a variety of artwork and promotion material for the games, and listen to music from the games (and see achievements linked to the Steam achievements).

Part 3: For Existing MMBN Fans

The in game changes are relatively minor. Ever game has a ""buster-max"" mode which lets you put your base megabuster damage to 100 if you want to just skip through some tedious parts of the games. The text has been replaced from the pixelated ones with new high resolution ones. The games are all based on the JP versions, so there isn't any cut content (well, except Botkai Crossover battles in 6 and Beast Gate content), so there is more content than the GBA Western release. You can change languages in the option menu on the same save, which can be nice for those learning Japanese and/or Chinese. There is a filter option which starts as on by default, but you can turn it off (I personally do). There are also borders you can select around the game, but there is no ""no border"" option for those of you who do not like it. Some bugs were patched out, and some were kept in single-player but patched out of PvP battles. Enumerating which were are beyond the scope of this review, but you can check out fan communities for detailed info if you are interested, like Rockman exe corner and Team Battle Network.

Some bugs have been introduced, however. A minor visual one involving sprites looking like they are standing on the player character is somewhat common. More seriously, the MMBN6 Virus Battler rewards currently are set to the ones from the western GBA release which is problematic, so you should change your language to Japanese when doing it until that is fixed.

Another minor annoyance is with the soundtrack currently being a mono version of it, rather than Stereo which was in the GBA games. I imagine there will be a fan patch for this in the near future. Another is that the game used Denuvo. However, Capcom usually removes it a year or two after release, if previous releases are anything to go by, so it probably won't be permanent.",1.0

By the time I got there party was half tired. It also seems like they slowed down pretty much everything just to make it appear that the game is longer than it actually is and they also added some very frustrating grind elements. Combat is punishing and not in a good way. You can lower the difficulty but that makes the game extremely boring. Also party management, unlocks and professions is very poorly implemented. There are some nice elements hidden somewhere under all this bs but I dont have the time or patience to figure all of that out. Might be worth revisiting when it is on a deep sale.",0.0

The first level was short, while some are long and could even be made as their own game.  The detective world was pretty unique, would have liked it if it was expanded on, and the pokemon-esque world was the best one IMO.

Overall, it was enjoyable to play, worth a buy despite it only being around 3 hours.  Would like DLC in the future of some more worlds, hopefully a bit longer in length.",1.0

2662,136661406.0,762370,"Where do I start with [i]EIGTBOK[/i]?

I first played the game on Itch several years ago-- it's been long enough now that I truly can't remember how I originally found it. I could've just been looking for new and unique indie games. Boy, did I get my wish.

A little context here, since people read reviews to see if they'll like something or not: [i]EIGTBOK[/i] is a fantastic collection of bizarre and engaging little minigames and hidden secrets on the world's weirdest desktop, but it's also what many would weightily appellate an ""Art Game™"", so if you get cold feet about an author being frank and open about their life or your adventures through multicolor cyberspace occasionally being interrupted by grim reminders of the real world, go now or forever hold your peace.

There, that's your tl;dr.

Still here? Good. I like you.

[i]Everything is going to be OK[/i] is not just a game about the Internet, or trauma, or the stress of being an artist. It is a stupendous crescendo to the author's previous works in the vein of web art, spanning everywhere from [i]BlueSuburbia[/i] (waiting with baited breath for that remake...) to [i]Tetrageddon[/i], and far predating pale imitators like Hypnospace Outlaw and the endless parade of other Weird Desktop Simulators we've seen in more recent years. It is the work of someone who is truly in love with their medium of choice. Nothing included is there to snag a merch deal with Hot Topic or turn into a popular Twitter meme, it's all painfully genuine, even and especially the silliest bits. 

It almost feels a little too intimate at times-- wading through the cheerfully suicidal bunnies and whimsically creaking cyberbones, it feels a bit like peaking into someone's very old and very weathered diary, new sheaves of paper shoved in every few years or so to extend its life, and consequentially expand your view of the feelings and events described within. It's fitting that so much of the more hidden content in the game is literal poetry.

Every playthrough I try to go through the little ritual of wading through the numbered programs in ""order"" (Numbered 'Pages', then 'missing' pages), but it's inevitable that anyone would get lost on the labyrinth somewhere along the way. This is what I would consider a feature, not a bug. Further down the line, several applications you find seem to be re-purposed or reinvigorated Alienmelon projects from days of yore, frankensteined back to life here for your enjoyment. Contest entries, desktop pets, other programs of obscure origin and even vaguer purpose. It is, and I mean this as high praise, a shockingly dense text for a solo project.

Replaying it for this review, I even found new things I somehow hadn't stumbled across before-- I'm STILL not sure how many sound effects are in the duckmonkey music minigame, for example. I can't imagine how long that must've taken to record and program. And towards the end I discovered an entire essay, hiding away in one small button. (No, I won't tell you where. That's for YOU to figure out!)

Everything Is Going To Be OK has made me cackle like a madman. It has made me contemplate my own life and the choices I've made. It has made me cry like a child. But, most pertinently to the point I am trying to make, again and again it restores my faith in video games as an art and storytelling medium. Maybe everything really [i]is[/i] going to be okay.

...Also, like, it's been in the MoMA. If that sweetens the pot for you at all.

2669,136712737.0,2329130,"Rewind or Die"" is a thrilling and gruesome horror game that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. As a fan of Puppet Combo's previous works, I was excited to try out their latest creation and I wasn't disappointed.

The game's retro aesthetic and VHS-style visuals create a truly immersive and nostalgic experience, reminiscent of classic horror films from the 80s and 90s. The gameplay is challenging, but never feels unfair or frustrating, as you navigate through eerie environments and encounter terrifying enemies.

One of the standout features of ""Rewind or Die"" is its unique ""rewind"" mechanic, which allows players to go back in time and try again if they meet a gruesome end. This adds an interesting layer of strategy to the game, as you must plan your movements and actions carefully in order to avoid being killed.

The sound design in ""Rewind or Die"" is also worth mentioning, as it adds to the game's overall atmosphere and sense of dread. The music and sound effects are expertly crafted to create an unsettling and immersive experience.

Overall, ""Rewind or Die"" is a fantastic horror game that I would highly recommend to fans of the genre, especially those who appreciate Puppet Combo's unique and creative approach to horror gaming. With its retro style, challenging gameplay, and innovative mechanics, ""Rewind or Die"" is sure to keep you entertained and terrified for hours on end.",1.0

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
    [*]The setting - Like I said earlier, the level design and visuals are fantastic, definitely up there with the rest of the Torture Star/Puppet Combo games. If anything, it might even take the #1 spot.
    [*]The villain - Not too much to say here as most villains in these games don't get much development past their looks and actions. The pig look is freaky and cool looking, and his sprint animation is pretty scary too.
    [*]The scares - If you're not into random and unnecessary jump scares, this game might annoy you. But they got me good and I enjoyed them, so it's a pro for me.
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
    [*]The music - There is not a lot of music in this game. Not a huge deal, but my biggest issue is with the chase music, which you're going to hear a lot. The heavy metal song itself sounds cool, but it really takes me out of the experience. It's not scary at all, it's only startling because that means you're about to be chased.
    [*]The puzzles - You can turn your brain off for the entire game basically. The most engaging parts of the game were the sudden jump scares and chases. 
    [*]No sense of urgency - I never felt on edge except for one chapter of the game, where the killer is actually roaming around the level. Take Murderhouse or Stay Out Of The House for example, you have to complete puzzles WHILE the killer is actively looking for you, I always felt extremely anxious entering new rooms in those games. The killer, aside from scripted sequences, is no where near you for the majority of this game.

The game felt like it was about to get really good the entire time, and then it just ended. Unfortunate, because I did enjoy my time for a little bit; it just fell super flat.

My personal experience with this game has been nothing but positive. Extremely positive, actually. I died a lot, the game is hard, but I enjoyed every second of it. It's just a fun, really fresh game with a bit of a learning curve. If you are sitting here juggling the idea of buying the game, I'd say go for it and see what you think for yourself. Just be ready to learn, and don't give up. A game has not hooked me like this in a long time - if you enjoy the genre, it's worth your time.

I have watched streamers for many more hours playing it, besides my own experience with the game. It does not deserve the mixed reviews. Personally I put it up there after Monster Train and Vault of the Void. Two of the best card games in my opinion.

The first runs, on the starting difficulty are easy. And I have died 15+ times before beating the boss the first time. Wildfrost expects you to pay attention to the board, plan your moves. Your dmg output and your HP pool. The action economy instead of mana is implemented in a genious way, but in the end, it is a game you have to learn to play as if it was your first card game. And that is what I believe makes everyone think it is unballanced. Your skills from other card games come into this one, but you have to adapt them.

I would highly suggest catching a stream of Celerity or Esty8nine on twitch if you are not sure if Wildfrost is for you. The communities there are awesome, and can help you decide.

Every run is so interesting, the cards interact in so many ways depending on the board and the modifiers on them (charms).  It is crazy how polished the game is mechanically. The run variety is amazing. The unlocks add to the complexity of the game gradually. There are 3 factions that play quite differently. And overall feels so fresh in a game genre where the majority of games are more of the same formula, or not so good attempts to innovate.

I'm writing this review because I really enjoy this game and I'm deeply saddened to see so many negative reviews, especially when I disagree with their theses.

A lot of the negative reviews focus on game balance, and RNG.
To preface, I've played both demo cycles of this game, and have currently won two runs. (9 hrs of playtime)
I think it would definitely be good if some cards got re-balance love, but most cards are very obviously good, or not so good. This is very normal for rogue-like deckbuilders! Some tools are bad, unless you're already severely lacking in them.
This game isn't necessarily easy, despite the art style, and you should not necessarily win every run!

I believe a lot of players are either not thinking through their turns properly, or are not used to the style of gameplay this game revolves around (Each unit has a turn timer until it triggers). The rng in this game is sometimes punishing (as is the nature of rogue-likes), but it never feels unfair. If your deck is based around abusing a single mechanic, prepare to lose if you find yourself against a horde of enemies built to counter it! Building decks with tools to counter your counters is essential.

I think the game could benefit from some ui quality of life changes, (hovering over enemy charms and being able to see their effects, undoing held cards is sometimes finicky), but overall this game is amazing. I highly recommend it.",1.0

2704,136656075.0,2328760,"I love Pinball FX3 and 2 and have played about 530 hours in both games. I didn't like Zen's move to be Epic-inclusive for some time (a year or so), but understand that they had to do it because of financial reasons.

Now that FX is finally available on Steam I was excited and had my wallet ready to buy all tables at launch, something I had done in all those years of FX2 and FX3. But the wait was not worth it.

Table physics are better and more realistic now, not just on real-life machines (Williams tables etc.), but on all of them. As I haven't really played the real machines, the physics of FX3 were ok to me...but I guess, they are better now...so it's a point for Zen.

However, there's not more to like at the moment...

+/good:
1) Physics
2) New tables available

~/average:
You have to buy all tables you own in FX3 again. It's understandable though as nobody works for free.

-/bad:

1) The whole idea to launch FX instead of keeping FX3 and releasing new tables for it

2) UI and menus: I prefer FX3. In the German localization a lot of menus have shortened text that looks odd. Filtering tables and tournaments is tedious and fiddly.

3) Option menu: You cannot even assign buttons freely, but have to use presets. A to shoot, B to change camera like I'm used to from FX3 is not possible.

4) The graphics are a bit better, but at first glance, the remastered FX3 tables just look like there was a cheap filter or effect added. I am used to the old look and graphics...they were good enough.

5) ""Modern"" full-color DMD: I'm 43 and used to the charm of retro displays. I know some new real-life machines such as The Hobbit have full-color DMDs with actual film footage, but I don't like them either. I prefer the old look.

[list]
    [*][b]Pixel art[/b]: The pixel art, as evident from the screenshots, is gorgeous. There's lots of little details, like the grass being pushed down under your feet as you walk over it, that are easy to overlook but definitely add up to something beautiful.
    [*][b]Grappling, in theory[/b]: The grappling, when it works, is great. Slingshotting yourself over hazards is satisfying.
[/list]

[h1]The Not-As-Good[/h1]
[list]
    [*][b]Grappling, in practice[/b]: There is basically no tutorial section or guidance on how to utilize the grappling system to its greatest potential. Many times during boss fights I would think, [i]how the hell am I supposed to avoid that attack?[/i] because I couldn't find a way to grapple that allowed me to...you know...avoid the attack. This made some fights feel like marathon slogs because of one seemingly impossible-to-dodge attack. (Yes, I'm sure there's been no-hit runs of this game. No, I'm not capable of such a feat.) Many jumping puzzles look possible to do with your current ability set, but are actually meant for later in the game once you have new abilities -- however, no obvious indication is given that you're wasting your time. Many jumps are [i]just[/i] out of reach, and when you don't make them, it creates a moment of ""Am I just messing up grappling hook physics, or is this legitimately not possible to do at this point?""
    [*][b]Player guns[/b]: I found that I basically always had to have the trinket that extends the range of my bullets attached because, otherwise, it seemed like I had to basically be kissing the bosses in order to hit them. And when every boss is capable of killing you in 2-3 hits, being so close simply is not a feasible strategy at times unless you've managed to memorize every attack of every phase. With the paltry coinage that enemies dropped, I found myself wanting to avoid fighting enemies because the gunplay is so mediocre at the best of times that I didn't want to risk losing health (or worse, dying and losing a chunk of progress) because I had to be on top of the enemies in order to hit them. I mean, the first gun that the game gives you is basically a rapid-fire charge gun. Why do I have to be four feet away from the target to effectively use it?
    [*][b]Difficulty[/b]: I was prepared for a challenge. I wasn't prepared for an amazingly un-fun challenge. Don't know how to use the grapple effectively because the game didn't teach you the basics? Have fun trying one puzzle jump dozens of times until, somehow, you manage to make it across...only to be faced with [i]another[/i] puzzle jump that requires multiple attempts. And don't you dare die at this point, because death sends you back to your last save and undoes all of your progress -- say goodbye to completed rooms and acquired items, and have fun going to get them again.
    [*][b]Protagonist, or lack thereof[/b]: I read the dialogue. I found bits of lore. And I'm still REALLY confused on who I'm supposed to root for in this game. You'd think the player character, right? Well, no, she blew up a lab full of innocents to kickstart the game, and she thinks a story where everyone in a village drowns for no reason is ""humorous."" Maybe the characters we fight are the ones to support- ah, no, apparently they kill kids and torture the fae. I played up through three or four major bosses and about a dozen map regions, and I didn't find a single character that I liked and/or wanted to support. EVERYONE seems like a terrible, terrible person.
    [*][b]One grapple per boots-on-the-ground[/b]: Maybe this is fixed by a later ability, but with a grappling hook, doesn't it make sense to want to chain together grapples through difficult areas in order to create a satisfying series of jumps? Locking the grapple ability to once per use until you land on the ground again made every jumping section a case of ""How do I get to that patch of ground. Okay, how do I get to THAT patch of ground. Okay, now how about THAT patch of ground."" Really feels like a missed opportunity to create some interesting and challenging platforming sections.
    [*][b]Discerning important objects from each other[/b]: Many boss fights were made more difficult for me simply because I couldn't tell what was my bullet, what was an enemy bullet/sword/whatever, what part of the boss (if any) caused contact damage and when, and what was a background element. For instance, with the boss fight with all the swords (for those who played to that part, you know the one), I found that, in phase 2, the swords that locked onto your position were colored like they were in the background right up until they fly directly at you from eight feet away.
    [*][b]Healing, grenades, and One Bar to Charge Them All[/b]: the devs took a page from Hollow Knight's book and tied both your heal and your ranged attack to a chargeable meter. But whereas Hollow Knight made that an obvious and integral part of the game, I found myself chipping away at enemies trying to slowly charge the bar just so I could get another weak heal out of it. I never used the ranged attack other than to open doors that required it because, well, why would I waste my mana on a ranged attack that is VERY easy to miss when I could instead save it for another heal that could potentially save me from having to restart a platforming section or a challenging boss?

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
If you're hard up for a ""Metroidvania"" (I use that term loosely here, since new movement/traversal abilites seem very sparse at least in the early game) and want to try a game with interesting-but-confusing movement mechanics, consider Rusted Moss. If you just want another Metroidvania, grab...literally anything else in the genre, honestly.

EDIT: I just checked, and seriously? Achievements tied to speedrunning with certain completion requirements? Oh, **** off.",0.0
2716,136657460.0,1772830,"Games pretty fun. It's very open after the tutorial boss with lots of places to explore and items to find though some areas are much more difficult to do earlier. I generally haven't liked grapple systems in the games I've played but this one worked for some reason. Combat is pretty eh, it's not really bad but I don't think there is much to write home about. It's mostly trivial with a few exceptions that require a fairly high degree of precision(It's mostly contained to 1 area). A few times they make you do combat in weird scenarios which I like but there are also quite a lot of boring battle rooms where you just fight 3-5 generic enemies in a boring battle arena. Death is fairly punishing though outside of one area save points are pretty abundant. The mediocre combat is made up for by the platforming segments being extremely fun and reward creativity with most of them having multiple ways of going about them depending on your skill with the games physics engine. There is also a ton of speed tech you can learn if you want to go fast. There are few bugs but none of them were very disruptive and it seems like they'll be patched out soon.

2721,136710921.0,2329130,"Right. I have a lot positive to say, and very little negative. Like, no negatives at all. And for reference, I did 2 playthroughs for testing on both the Steam Deck and standard Windows PC, and I can safely say this is one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a while. It absolutely doesn't waste your time, and absolutely rewards replays. I will cover what I enjoyed, cause there's nothing I disliked, and then talk about some wee bugs I encountered, which weren't game breaking or anything, so they weren't bad... at all, really. And also in the case of Steam Deck, it could be down to the preset Proton it uses causing issues.

So what are the positives?
-Amazing music
-Fun characters. I am british, and the game is british, so it's a no brainer that I enjoyed the humour that comes from the characters. I absolutely appreciated the design of the killer too
-Amazing artstyle and colour scheme
-The easter egg(s) and references to pop culture were enjoyable to find and understand
-The game is only about 4 hours long per playthrough, which is short and sweet, and something I appreciate alot more as I grow older
-Just play the game, you'll understand more fully. It's absolutely worth every playthrough.

You mentioned issues with the game?!?!!??!?
Barely, but yes, which is absolutely why I did two playthroughs, just to see what the difference between Steam Deck and my laptop were.....but there still weren't alot of issues, either. Pretty much all it comes down to is:
-Steam Deck had some flickering textures, some minor performance stutters, but only really affected my experience for a few seconds everytime it happened. I played on Handheld at 60hz, but didn't test docked because I'm too lazy to plug it in again. But if you only have a Steam Deck, you won't have any real issues with it on there, and the trackpads will also be very helpful in your adventure, and you have to be absolutely mindful of Proton, especially when the game is unsupported, there is no real telling what exactly will happen with the game, so do keep that in mind
-Game specific...... I found a way to glitch deeper beside a locker with the door in the security room by just walking into it while it was opening up, and moving the camera around a bit to get yourself fully lodged in there. But literally all you have to do to get out is close the door and it'll send you flying to the other side of the room. I don't even see it as an issue, it's quite entertaining to do. I couldn't find any issues the Steam Deck didn't have already, so both experiences are absolutely amazing from the getgo.

So overall?
I've never been so hooked on a game in my life, and I really do mean that. Especially because of the length of the game, I couldn't help but just continue playing till the end, and even to 100% every achievement. The environment is so pretty to look at, you can pet the dog and enjoy a nifty 4 hour tale about a pig killer doing killer things. Not much else to say, apart from what was already in the bullet points..... ALTHOUGH, do not play with the VHS filter off. The flickering becomes much more of a problem with it off, and even shows off unique flickering to the filter being off, which I suppose the VHS filter is able to hide. It definitely ruins the vibe of the game, but I totally get why such a feature is implemented, and I'm not gonna put that as a negative for it. It's helpful for those that need it, but at least currently, it's quite hard to look at. But otherwise, the game is amazing, and you should absolutely play it now.",1.0
2722,136785992.0,2338410,"I really like the controls, they are simple and work really well but I dislike almost everything else.
The style of the game and the musics are pretty good too.

There is 28 arenas but they all feel the same and are very small.
You have a random powerup spawner in the middle, some walls around it and environmental hazards like lasers and fires that can damage the cars most of the time located in the edges of the map.
There is no reward for exploration since the spawner is alway in the middle, there isn't several of them and there is no destructible walls or anything like that.

The powerups aren't very satisfying to use.
One give you extra speed but you don't care because the arenas are super cramped anyway.
There is one that give you youre special but the way it work is meh.
You press right mouse button then you see youre character appear in youre screen and every opponent on the map instantly die from what I understand.
Would've been cool if every character had a different specials and also if you would have to aim with it instead of just killing everybody on the spot.
Apart from that there is the health and invincibility ones that are self explanatory.

The story is badly made but it's because the developper is clearly a kid.
I'm not an english speaker but the way the characters speak is very rudimentary.
The story present itself on the form of very slow powerpoints between each battles you do but you can't skip these and you can't click to make the pages pass faster.
Imo the story us pretty cringy but since the developper is a kid I'll cut him some slack, I don't care about the story anyway, I was here for the gameplay.

The way you fight is very meh.
Imagine you are playing Twisted Metal so you have the base machinegun that you can alway shoot with because it has infinite ammo, but you have no other weapons apart from the special that spawn from time to time for you or a bot to pick up and again, you don't have to aim with it, it just kill everybody on the map.
That's honestly boring.
Also there isn't really physics in this game, so you can't push the bots into the hazards to kill them and there is also no collision damage from what I've seen.
The only creative thing you can do is wait for them to get stuck into a hazard or a wall and stay on their ass to prevent them from backing out or turning while shooting them for extra damage.

There is 4 different characters but apart from them having different storys and endings, there isn't much point to having several of them because they all play the same, their cars aren't very different apart from their colours and the special is the same for each of them.

If you are reading this dev please don't take this review personally because you have a lot of potential.
Imo making a game like that as a kid is pretty impressive.
The controls are so f*cking good, I like the idea of steering with the mouse and having the possibility to freelook with it by pressing the middle mouse button.
The game look cool, I love it's Tron style and the electronic music.
I feel what hurt it the most is that there isn't enough variety in gameplay like in old games like Twisted Metal or Vigilante 8 apart from the characters having each their storys and endings.

A: You can select the regions you want to connect to on the matchmaking tab, it'll take a bit of time before everyone sees this and goes to their respective regions. (side note I want the game to remember what regions I have selected when I reboot it)

B: The game just came out in EARLY ACCESS of course it is not going to have a major amount of content because that takes time. (I would very much like to see a competitive game mode and also some modes with more than 5v5)

Since you're in space, where there is no air, you have have 2 health bars, One is your suit, the more you get hit, the more it will go down but sometimes it will become punctured in which you need to patch it up, which doesn't take long but the more you wait, the more it will drain your second health bar, oxygen, if it runs out then you pass out and die, pretty simple, the only time you have to worry about running out is if your suit is punctured. 

This game is a dream to play, the gun play is pretty cool due to there being nothing quite like it on the market. The zero gravity really flips how you think about recoil and range. Also the physics are very interesting, with your gun's recoil pushing you back certain distances depending on the type of ammo fired. As well as on certain maps you can pressurize rooms which eliminates your oxygen bar while you are in the room, you can also open a door which will launch you out into the map (think of the gravity launchers in Apex Legends).

You can also customize your astronaut which is cool but I wish there were more cosmetics (probably will come with time; side note I really, really want country flags as patches).

2740,136729443.0,1811990,"I loved the Demo! But the full release game is crippling in difficulty. The first boss you'll face is relatively easy. To give you an idea, you'll have 1 mini boss fight. After that you'll get 2-3 random bonuses you can collect. It may be an extra hero card or it can be a charm to boost a single cards damage. Then you fight the second mini boss. This one is a bit tougher and whatever you've set yourself up for will decide whether you get destroyed quickly. If the 1st fight is a 2/10 for difficulty, I'd say the second one is a 4/10.

After you beat the second boss you'll get another 2-3 bonuses including an option to visit a shop to buy charms or cards with the money you earned on the last 2 fights. What you do at this point is extremely important and if you feel like you've barely made it through the second fight then you might as well just start over because the 3rd fight is easily a 10/10 for difficulty and it's brutal. It's the ""main boss"" fight for this chapter of the game. The mechanics and how quickly the enemies advances is nearly impossible if you don't look up a card meta which just always seems silly to me in video games. Like why look up a meta so that I can auto pilot an adventure game just to say I beat it. You might as well hire a robot to beat the game for you. Anyway, I digress.

The issue here is that you've literally only fought 2 battles at this point. Now the 3rd being the main boss fight and only 6 chances to gear up seems pretty crazy considering the boss mechanics. You will fight 1 of 2 main bosses here but they both have a similar second phase mechanic where they either split into 2 smaller version of themselves or they gain 1 attack every single time they hit you. One of the bosses comes out with a hero card with a turn cooldown of 1. So it has a turn every round. Oh yeah, that same card gains 1 attack each turn. So it just snowballs damage. So while you have 3-4 cards on the field, the enemy has all 5. 2 of which are snowballing damage, 1 gives you a debuff that doubles your damage received, and the other does equal damage to its health every 3rd turn which is 6 damage. Most hero cards only have 5-8 health lol.

It's an absolute shit show of a fight and at first I was like ""I enjoy a challenge. I'll start building a deck and creating a cool build to do this fight"" and in 5 hours, 25 runs later, I beat it once only to die right after on the second chapter on the first fight.

The boss fights really need nerfed. I think the damages are fine and add a challenging component to deck building but 3 fights? dude. I cant even get out of the first chapter. I'm tired of seeing the snow. Devs. PLEASE. HOW DID THIS EVEN GET BETA TESTED LIKE THIS.",0.0

If you like doom-alikes, you'll love this. Fun shoot-n-scoot gameplay, intermixed with the occasional end-of-level bosses. Great ambience, gritty and moody lighting, interesting levels, variety of monsters and weapons to take them down.

Tips: Strafe often! Keep your shotgun handy (and rarely let your finger off the trigger!) And, don't be afraid to be a save-scummer -- you'll die often, and restarting at the beginning of a level is a PITA!

Kudos to the devs for making such a fun game! =)

Yep, you read that right. The remake of the classic SH game The Awakened is fantastic and the expanded storyline alongside the the side cases (which are quite a lot compared to what I expected) make it so much better than the original. I am a proud backer of the kickstarter campaign for this project. I have no regrets. It was worth it.

The story is almost the same, some minor changes here and there. It was rewritten to fit in the new timeline. There are some references to Chapter One but if you're a new player, don't worry. You can play it as a standalone game. You are in for a real treat !

The characters, what can I say ? The chemistry between the new friends-to-be Holmes and Watson is on point. This journey tests their relationship to the maximum.

The music is splendid. It makes the experience even more immersive. The dark atmoshpere of the game is *chef's kiss*.

The gameplay mechanics are the same as Chapter One's with some little differences. There is the mind palace (which is different from the previous games), deductions, pin an evidence to search for more clues, interact with people, you can change Holmes and Watson's clother.

The graphics are great, the game ran very smoothly. The team did a great job in optimizing it.

Frogwares deserves all the praise and our respect for what they've done. Delivering a game in such tough times and in so little time...it's incredible. The game was announced in July 2022 and now in April 2023 we are playing it. Frogwares, I take my hat off before you ! Well done !",1.0

2757,136684487.0,1811990,"Art and music are amazing, and despite the ""serviceable"" gameplay they make the game still worth playing. However, do remember by purchasing you're directly supporting Chucklefish, who are an exploitative and abusive company.

What's wrong with the gameplay? I'm an A20H Slay the Spire player, and because I was expecting this to be a contender to StS, I'm going to judge it relative to that. If you're not looking for a StS-like experience, then take the below with a grain of salt. I also only played for 2 hours, so I can't comment on how the game changes as you unlock more items.

In general, the most disappointing part of the experience was the lack of agency. I felt that playing only one card per turn significantly reduced the sense of control, despite turns being more numerous and shorter than StS. Being able to also move units does not add much to the decision space, as it's usually obvious what the best positioning is.

Outside of combat, the pathing options are reduced (Monster Train style), and there is a complete lack of events - your choice are usually card removal, gold, a shop, a card or a charm.  

From the few relics I saw, these appear to be far less interesting than other deckbuilders. The only relics I saw in my gametime affected card draw/other uninteresting things. There are also no card upgrades, but you can add effects to cards using charms.

All of this made me question the long term replayability of the game, as there simply isn't enough variation in the gameplay, or enough interesting decisions to make, for me to see myself putting even 50+ hours into this. Not to mention the lack of ascensions, beyond what I hear is simply adding random charms to enemies, which is a very lazy way to scale difficulty.

And finally, be warned that the game *is* reasonably difficult, but I did beat the first two bosses within my 2hr playtime. The difficulty of the game is a really weird design choice, as the lack of agency (and the cute artwork) really make you expect to be able to breeze through, and that's clear from the negative reviews the game is getting. This game really needs to decide who its core audience is, because right now it's appealing to neither the die-hard deckbuilder fans nor the casual players.

2788,136656394.0,1811990,"This is definitely one of my favorite roguelike deckbuilders, up there with Slay the Spire and Across the Obelisk. The art and music are fantastic and the game is fun. There several different factions, each with multiple playstyles to ensure each run feels different. It's a difficult game. It definitely encourages you to think out every move. It punishes your for mistakes but it doesn't feel unfair. The runs are also short enough that losing doesn't feel terrible. My only outstanding question at this point is how replayable the game is once you beat the boss.

At the time of writing this the game is getting review bombed and I'm not sure why. It definitely doesn't deserve it. People are saying it's too hard and unbalanced. Yes the game is difficult, but to me it feels about the same level of difficulty as Slay the Spire. I've done about 20ish runs or so at this point and made it to the final boss twice. I died there once due to bad luck and once due to my own misplays. I would also disagree that the game is unbalanced. Each playstyle (thorns, poison, frost, etc.) can be super powerful if built into, but they all have their counters. The game will try to find a weakspot in your deck, but you can learn from that and exploit the enemies weaknesses too. 

All in all, it's an awesome game that deserves more love.",1.0
2789,136682300.0,1811990,"I really enjoy this game. art is great and the random rng is actually fun with forcing you to make interesting mixes of comps and strats. The balance obviously seems a little off for casual play because there is a lot going on per turn as well as not paying attention to 1 turn could mean you get wiped. The trinket system is really cool and I would like to see that polished with more options to make your own custom cards in combat more. I think if the enemies were a little less responsive so quickly or reinforcement counter was like a turn longer it might flesh it out more.

Just my opinion. For the hero you start with, maybe add a little more pizzazz to them like with hero options:
--
Better stat hero
--
Hard focus strategy hero
--
more than one status effect
--

Around those options only because, starting with a 3 health range hero with long shot feels pretty bad when your random companion rng isn't a tank. I like the game, difficulty is always weird with people in rouges but it comes with the territory.",1.0

HOWEVER, the other reviews are correct in that this game desperately needs a balance pass. Certain builds will work great until you encounter a specific boss. For example, using a thorn/smackback build will always fail against King Moko (a boss that requires you hit them repeatedly and quickly). 

In addition, the mechanic that the final boss uses can easily prevent you from ever winning the game again. On my first (and only) win I had a build that was absolutely insane. Because of that, the final boss is now virtually impossible to beat.",1.0

2793,136681262.0,1772830,"Just finished 100%

I liked the game (obviously) but here's my main criticisms:

Because most the game is gated by the skill you need from your grappling hook, you can go almost anywhere from the get go, while most skills afterwards just make your hook easier to use. This is cool for exploration- but in turn you can get super deep into a section of the map just to hit a brick wall requiring a certain item right before the end (looking at you, Lab)

Also expect some bugs- like the item tracker being wrong for one area of the game, or one section of the map where I literally had to glitch through a wall to make it into (still no idea what the intended route for that was)

The story is a bit messy, especially how the end feels rushed together, and the combat in general really isn't that enjoyable. The pistol is the only fun weapon to use, but you spend most the game using the rocket launcher because it comes paired with necessary movement options

And lmao shoutouts to the trinket you get halfway into the game that makes the UI legible, why would that not just be a default thing

That said, I'm a big deckbuilder fan and have spent hundreds of hours playing these kinds of games, and it took me ten hours before I won a run, and I feel like rng has a big part in whether you get the necessary tools to win or not.

I really enjoyed the game from start to finish. Some cheesy gimmick scares at times, but overall the scares were on point and so was the heartwarming and sad story that came with it all

PROS:

+Great scares
+Great atmosphere, graphics and sound quality. Everything in this game from an atmosphere standpoint was on point. 
+Easy learning curve and controls. Many indie titles are a bit rough controls wise but this was on point. When the rooms went dark, I could still navigate myself enough around to proceed with the objectives
+Very sad story that wrapped up nicely at the end. A bit ambiguous of an ending, but I think I understand what happened. It was sad but heartwarming at the same time. It concludes the darkness.
+A Free roam option added on. Just an added bonus.

CONS: 

-Sometimes scares can be a bit cliche, as in we've seen that style of scare so many times. But overall they're effective
-Short, but you essentially get what you pay for. Great price for this level of content and a lot to offer.

The worst part is that before release, someone in the discussions for this game called this out as unfun and the dev just didn't fix it. I hate to be hard on this game but it's not a fun mechanic. Coupled with the lack of proper controller support (key binding is not the same as controller support), the weird audio issues (game somehow launched on first start at 500% master, plus whenever you go into the pause or level up menu the sound distorts), and that the controls somehow deteriorated as gameplay progressed and this is a pretty solid not recommend.

Also, allow me to also say, this is a remake of a 2006 game I never played. So take that for what you will.

(For anyone who wants a taste, the Demo starts in the first section of Chapter Three. Just far enough learn the mechanics of the game, but also enough to wonder how you got there and where it will end.)

Right now though. You are, of course, Sherlock Holmes. And you are freshly transported to London from your times in Cordona (ala Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One). You and your new acquaintance John Watson (who suspiciously reminds you of your imaginary friend Jon) have decided to take up and room with one another. Then, after a string of events, Sherlock has been lead to the case of a recently kidnapped individual, which is where our game starts. Naturally, he investigates, which leads him down a rabbit hole that leaves him questioning most of what he knows.

As a longtime FrogWares fan, I can see both new and returning mechanics. The Awakening is a sprawling tale, yet also a singular story from start to end. Which is a departure from their previous works. Gone are the wide open landscapes of Chapter One, the giant world that is Cordona and the multiple story lines drawn within, eager for exploration. What is brought back is the episodic nature that is Crime and Punishment and The Devils' Daughter. Each of those games have singular stories where you, the player find the clues, point your finger at the ne'er-do'-well, and solve the case. Only to go on to the next unconnected case. 

Now, you have a mesh of the two. There is no sprawling world, and each map is its own entity, but each chapter transition leads you further into the same, greater story. And perhaps, a little further into madness... 

One more note, I would *very highly* recommend playing FrogWare's Chapter One before this game. It's not at all necessary, but I feel as though it sheds a lot of light onto Sherlock's motivations in The Awakened.",1.0

The story was masterfully written and filled with character and depth that can only be appreciated more with further playthroughs to explore the branching paths that go against our natural instincts.

The story beats kept me guessing too, with meticulously hand-picked dialogue choices that thankfully rarely, if ever, offered aid or a new perspective on any situation. Without spoiling any story details, Tron: Identity hides consequences within even the most well intended choices, and with an auto-save after every choice. I really felt my characters emotions whenever something didn’t go my way, either due to an immediate branching choice, or one I made earlier. As I am one who likes to always make the right choices in these kind of games, Tron: Identity really challenged that, never giving even the subtlest hint at what the “right” choice is in any situation. They all have consequences in some way or another, even those that you may consider to be the morally right choice. I’d even go so far to say it may be difficult on a second playthrough to get the “best” outcome from every branching path.

A quote from the game that sums up my experience perfectly is “you’ve seen where good intentions can lead”.",1.0

This is a really nice, scary and atmospheric indie horror game that came out today. The graphics are not ultra-realistic but they are good, the sound is good, the story is nice but short, I've found no bugs, no performance issues and not many puzzles are featured in the game (you mostly need to find objects in order to advance in the story, which is good for people looking for a horror game, not a 'puzzle' horror game). I've liked most of the things about this game besides the price (around 9$) that is a bit much for a 30 min game, just my opinion.

It's a charming city builder with a fantasy/fairy-tale vibe, and it sets itself apart by allowing you to form marriages, alliances, and invade other princes and princesses. There is also a split between peasants, commoners, nobles, and their quarters and needs, which is actually pretty charming.

As a seasoned CS and Siege player i agree with everyone saying Breachers is like a VR hybrid of the two in all the best ways and that it has the core for a great competitive scene in place from the get go. 

That said, the game still needs an actual competitive mode that let's you play a match from beginning to end with the same team. Currently only ""old school"" dedicated servers are around and that means that people jump in and out of matches and immature people (kids or not) are there to piss you off from time to time. A ranked system with proper ban system would sort this out.

2863,136711502.0,1811990,"I don' typically write reviews for games, which is on me. I should write more. However, when I heard on NL's Twitch that this game had a near 50% review, I was baffled. The negative reviews I've read about this game so far are ridiculous. I don't mean that as a stab against those who wrote the reviews nor do I mean to say that I'm better at the game than them. I'm probably not. What I mean to say is that those reviews are very divorced from my experience with the game, so much so that I felt compelled to speak up.

I've played a lot of roguelite/like deckbuilders. It's my favorite genre. I used to play digital card games competitively. I have and currently do play TCGs competitively. My home collection of board games largely consists of deckbuilders and LCGs. If it's a card game, I want to play it. This is the best deckbuilder I've played since Slay the Spire and Roguebook. It's freakin' phenomenal. Now, I'm not going to talk about the art, theme, ambiance, soundtrack, etc. Those things speak for themselves and they're great. The negative reviews seem aimed at the difficulty, so I'm going to address the elephant in the room.

Yes, this game is tough. Yes, you will die. Yes, you will lose runs. If I wanted a guaranteed win, I have enough games in my library that offer a ""story"" mode. I choose to play roguelite deckbuilders because they're challenging and feel rewarding to beat. I think that's a big draw for most of us that follow this genre. I realize that I may take that to more of an extreme than most players. My next favorite genre are souls-like games, and I always play games on their hardest difficulty. I don't think you need to be like that to enjoy this game. However, if you are like me, then I think you'll really appreciate the challenge this game has to offer.

Is this game ""too"" tough? No, absolutely not. First off, I've aggressively played the first run a dozen times by deleting my save file and restarting. I do that with nearly every game that I play. I died many times. Every single time I died, I could articulate the exact reason why. It always felt like the loss was a direct consequence of my choice. I never once felt oppressed. Did I get frustrated? Sure. Learning can be frustrating sometimes. That's okay. But I did learn, and I did figure it out. Those mistakes taught me how to be better at the game. But did I eventually win? Yes, several times. Since winning that first run, I've only lost one run. The first run has several scripted elements that you can take advantage of to improve your win chances dramatically. I found them, and I feel VERY good about my win chances now. For those writing reviews about the difficulty of the game, if you cannot articulate the scripted elements of the first run, then I encourage to start over. I think you'll really appreciate them when you find them.

What about after the first run? I've won those too. I have consecutive wins on the same playthrough, and I still feel very good about my changes moving forward. Those consecutive runs have only gotten more fun and more interesting. There's lot of content to unlock, and I can't wait to enjoy it all. I think you'll find that there are worthwhile elements to unlock between runs.

What are some things I learned:
- Wildfrost rewards methodical play with versatile deckbuilding rather than decks that abuse a particular interaction.
- This is not a deckbuilder where you can start completing runs in 15 minutes. Your first win will probably take you over an hour. Some encounters will last a minutes or two. Some will last 15 to 20. You may need to take your time and that's okay.
- Wildfrost is not like many other deckbuilders. The cooldown counters will play with your brain for awhile until you acclimate to them. Slay the Spire trains you to thing in terms of ""them then me"". In Wildfrost, every character has a different rate at which they attack. You may have to track the separate cooldowns of up to 12 characters simultaneously in the harder encounters. I think that's been the hardest part of the game.
- You need to make use of all of the mechanics the game has to offer, not just the few that come easy.
- Wildfrost really rewards you for leaning into your deck. Don't think in terms of ""how do I win?"". You need to think in terms of ""how does my deck win?""
- In most cases, there are several threats on board. You need to figure out which threats you can mitigate and which you can't. The ones you can't need to be prioritized. In most cases, that's not the boss.
- Cooldown reduction is often a trap.
- Poison is extremely powerful.
- Crowns and charms are busted, and I love them.
- Lastly and most importantly, many of the things I started choosing to improve my chances were not and would not have been my first choice. They are also not the things that I've seen many streamers fall into yet. I learned from playing the game what works better, and it's made me better.

What about some of the things that other reviewers are saying:
- Will I die in my first encounter? Maybe. But that's a ridiculous notion to me.
- What if my leader has a 7 turn cooldown with no ability? Pick a different one. You get three to choose from.
- Are the encounters (like the fire one) oppressive? No. In my runs, my deck has been the oppressive one.
- Does the game punish you for dragging out encounters? No. I consistently win by dragging out the encounter. More of my encounters wins (especially those against bosses) have been about outlasting the enemies.
- Aren't you just setting yourself for a harder next run? Sure. But I've beaten those too.
- Is the charms mod for enemies ridiculous? I found it to be a fun take on the threat imposed by enemies, and I enjoy it. I always play with it on.
- Is there a ton of balancing that needs to be down before this game is playable? I don't think so.
- Is this game worth it's price tag? Absolutely.

Is there room for improvement? Absolutely.
- In game glossaries of keywords and interactions
- Better visual queues to highlight attack patterns
- Balancing bells to leave room for growth in daily runs
- Making summoned allies/enemies less abusive (players summon these btw)
- Rebalancing support characters like Pyra to make them more playable

I'm sure there are others I'm not thinking of, but I can play around all of them. They do not detract from my opportunity to have a great time playing this game. And the devs are already posted that they're going through a balancing and polishing phase first before moving to new content.

It was definitely a bit short (it took me just short of 11 hours to beat it with a good amount of extra exploration), but I found it was well worth the $20 I paid. The combat felt rewarding, especially dashing in and out to land hits with my greatsword and/or shotgun, although some enemies were a bit of a pain to fight. Also, while I never found any boss to be overly difficult, they all gave a decent enough challenge to be enjoyable, and they often had really great designs. I did notice a few odd performance/design issues, such as the music abruptly cutting at screen transitions or when resting at crow statues, and the hitboxes do occasionally seem a bit weird, but nothing seemed too bad. Enemies also respawn in most rooms upon re-entering, and I got hit once or twice upon entering a room, which isn't the best, but it wasn't terrible or frequent either.

Combat is as slow as watching grass grow, it feels as if the last 10 years of TRPGs didn't happen or the developers lived under a rock during all that time. But for me, the biggest offender, is the lack of consistency in the world's mechanics.

Stole an apple in this farm? Guess what, the rest of the ENTIRE province now suspects you... for some reason.
See these two boars there? Guess what! They become 7 when you enter combat!
See this battle where you can take sides? Yes, each side has 6 warriors according to the screen! But guess what! When you choose a side and fight the other, your side only get's 2 ally soldiers and the other side gets 7!! 
Oh, I see you have a warband of soldiers? Guess what! This group of 3 peasants can kill them with pitchforks!
See that group of refugees with a horse pulling on a cart? Guess what! You beat them and you get not the horse nor the cart!!


This type of game needs to follow consistent mechanics and visuals to provide the player with realistic important information, information that makes them do the best thing, not trick them into spending materials and medicine curing the warband with little to no gain from fighting 3 peasants armed with sticks and pitchforks, or having the entire province know that they are criminals immediately after taking an apple out of a barrel in some backwater shed...

While the inspiration from those games is definitely felt, Photon Engineer definitely distinguishes itself and presents a unique and engaging first-person puzzle experience. The setting and style of the game pops with a spacy color palette almost reminiscent of No Man’s Sky. The music choice is pleasing, ranging from peppy to soothing. The overarching plot narrative might be a tad weak, but that only serves as a backdrop for what really matters: the puzzles. There’s something deeply satisfying about freely floating around a puzzle room deciding where to place your precious few mirrors to solve a laser reflection puzzle that doesn’t quite seem to add up. When you do find the solution however, the satisfaction of that “aha” moment is so worth it. Some of the solutions I’ve discovered so far were hard-won but very clever – they always make sense in retrospect, and I’ve yet to come across a solution that felt “unfair.” The laser puzzles are broken up with some sliding tile puzzles as well, which can be deceptively devious for their simple appearances. The two styles of puzzles are staggered such that neither one will become stale or leave you fatigued. The pacing and teaching (environmentally, mostly) in the game is quite good, with only a couple of instances leaving me scratching my head about a game mechanic (an issue that the dev is actively improving). But overall Photon Engineer has been a very satisfying adventure and a substantial brain workout for me. I’m about 16 rooms deep in the game so far, and I’m looking forward to seeing where it goes from here!",1.0

If you have seen Vail VR its not as sweaty as that and with better gunplay but this game is more sweaty than the other shooters I mentioned previously. It is the right balance of fun but challenging. Yes as the other reviews mention it is full of quest kids and it can be really annoying, but that isn't an inherent problem with the game itself, rather the audience.

Game starts off pretty hard but once you get a few key level ups, you can start chewing through enemies with your cooldown based abilities. I am incredibly impressed with how unique each character is and how varied their individual playstyles are. This game is a rogue-lite technically but each (winning) run will take well over 10 hours, probably closer to the 15-20 hours for your first run.

I cannot stress enough just how FUN this game is and how much I've fallen in love with it. Its genuinely an improvement on the games that it gathered so much inspiration from. This game tries to do so much and succeeds on almost every point, you can clearly see the passion behind this title and the audience really does benefit from it. This is the easiest recommend that I have had in years.

Despite all my praise, there are three [i] small [/i] gripes I have with this game:
[*]  the XCOM Fog of War pod aggro system. If you move one tile too far you can pretty much be ambushed by enemies you're very much not ready for. Can slow the pace of the game significantly on certain maps.

[*]  no undo button for non-chance related actions. You overwatched someone and then realized 5 seconds later a much better use of their turn? Too bad, overwatch can't be de-activated even though it hasn't really taken effect yet.

[*]  there's an upgrade that gives you the ability to give an action to any character once per map ...except you can't use that ability on characters that have no remaining actions. For an ability that's once per map, it feels really bad to pre-emptively pop that once per map action on someone just in case they miss their 85% shot. Should have the option to provide that action to anyone, regardless of their current remaining actions.",1.0

[b]Runs perfectly on the steam deck, which I think is the best platform for this title.[/b]

Overall, the collection is overpriced considering anyone can run all of these games (often with netplay features and trading included) for the price of free if you have the most up to date graphing calculator. That being said, the games are still solid and presenting them in a complete package with all the extra download & patch cards does save a bit of time and setup headaches for dedicated fans. No issues performance-wise on multiple platforms, cloud saving is very nice. The home screen with animated megaman is pretty cool and his cliche voice lines are fun. The art and music galleries are very welcome inclusion since this series has some of the best of both on the GBA imo. 

The biggest gripe I have is with the piss poor presentation of the actual game window and borders when playing the game. The screen resolution of the gba makes for a very clunky transition to modern displays, and it looks like exactly 0 effort was spent trying to make it look even close to decent. The border images don't line up with the game window at all on any setting - and to that point, why isn't there an option to just disable the border image and blow the game up to near fullscreen? There's a pretty solid pixel filter, so why not use it? Why aren't there CRT filter effects or simulated ghosting to make the game more visually appealing and nostalgically accurate?

Would've loved to see a bit more effort put into possibly my favorite series on the gba, but oh well. 6/10 buy it on sale if you're inclined but your best bet is to just find alternative ways to play the game.",1.0

Tutorial's bare bones but frankly it has its purpose made clear, figured it out after a while, weapons can be found in ? Point of interests while ! Are boss locations. Bosses and ??? Will respawn.

Currently two bosses in the game, Riot and Queen 'Zumbie' 

Each boss you kill unlocks a weapon of respective tier for future use at the start of a round, i.e starting off with a tier 2 gun instead of using literally nothing. 

Game needs polish, it's an alpha, bosses can range anywhere from 'Can cheese with a corner' to ""Moderately difficult if fought head on.'

[spoiler]The Riot zombie can be cheesed by kiting it after phase 1, it's got a maximum range for its shotgun attacks, so just kite out of range, Queen Zombie can literally be cheesed by hiding in the stairs and peeking out to take shots.[/spoiler]

Game overall isn't horrible, pretty alright for an alpha release.

Only downside i've really seen from my own experience and other reviews, melee can be a little underwhelming and zombies can be unrelenting, unless you kite through several buildings I've had a boss zombie literally follow me halfway across the map. Aggro is unlimited from what I can tell.

2997,136844347.0,1797630,"Let's be clear, this not an awful game. It just fell short of what it could be. While the demo promised a mother-like rpg with poker instead of combat, the game feels more linear than I would have imagined. I'm a few hours in so far and am disappointed but overall enjoy the game. It's gotten a lot of Visual Novel comparison mostly because it's kind of like danganropa, but also because of its linearity and heavy diialogue.

The Dialogue is decent though overall and if you accept it for what it is you'll have a good time, but there are problems. For one, the poker is too easy, it may get harder later but it definitely leans into accessibility for everyone rather than lending itself to people who love poker. That being said, it totally is too niche for people who don't like poker. If you want to fight bat's in caves, this game will not scratch the itch.

The non poker games are fun, but the character says it himself, something like ""I came here to play poker, not lose money"". Poker naturally lends itself to grinding through difficult and tight situations to get better and play against better opponents, this game decided instead to use poker in lieu of combat. They could be playing chess, the poker part is mostly irrelevant when it comes to the storyline

It all feels so over the top, like the cool magician poker rpg spiraled into something else which is fun but ultimately not the poker rpg I was hoping for. Its hard to recommend this to either people who want a poker game or people who want an rpg, but if you don't mind that it doesn't do either as well as it could, then this might work for you. I think there is potential for greatness and I wish the dev success in their future games.",0.0

Only downside is that at this time there is no party systems so grouping with friends can be annoying at times. You will have better luck just making a private server and waiting for it to populate.

Feedback to the Devs - You've gotten everything right, for sustainability on a VR platform you will have to push constant updates even if Minor. Try to focus on the optimization first as lag will turn people away from a VR title. Eventually adding a player/community map system will benefit you, even if it is a voted through process from your team. Until then I would try to add in more maps as 3 or 4 maps at launch will get stale fast. Besides that keep up the hard work! Love this game.",1.0

The gun play is also great and I wouldn't change much, some balancing is needed which the devs have already noted. 

Tarkov ruined all FPS games for me and this is the first fps game I have enjoyed in years. 

A lot of people are not sold on the audio it certainly feels strange to start with but I soon grew to love it as we have all got so used to the overwhelming audio in most games now.

Spawns need a bit of work but this has also already been noted by the devs and the interaction and updates from the devs at launch has been really good and fills me with some confidence this game will only get better.

Other things to note are the UI could do with some work and region lock could do with being added. But the foundation for this game is really strong and unique if they can keep supporting it and polishing it, this will be Gem.

3026,136632296.0,1694740,"I hate to have to give this a negative review, but the controls are not proper in my opinion. Instead of thrust, WASD allows you to ""dodge"". Oddly, you have to hold down shift in order to thrust. This was unwieldy, so I changed thrust to W and just let that evasion direction go. But without reverse thrust, it's still too difficult to properly maneuver. I'm far from bad at video games, but with this kind of control scheme, I found it fairly impossible to beat even the second stage boss.

Maybe the controls are such that you're meant to use the dodge buttons exclusively in combat, but the game doesn't make this clear and I'm not sure if that would work better. And also, that's not really how ""dodge"" is supposed to be used.

That being said, I do like the other aspects. I like how the mining probes work, and the mechanics to force you to leave a sector after a certain time. I like the upgrade system too.

This game is good. I experienced a bit of the demo and I'm at nearly 6 hours of play - I beat my first run a couple hours ago, and I'm really impressed with how unique the game is. There's elements of Monster Train and Spire in this, with an especially interesting counter system that counts down to unit actions. There's a ton of room for depth, and what's here is challenging, fun, and (perhaps most importantly with so many roguelike deckbuilders out there) distinctive.

Negative reviews are complaining about the difficulty, for the most part (lots of curious eyes turned toward the ""balancing""). I have yet to explore the full depth of the game, but there's nothing about the mechanics that feel especially broken or unfair. There's a bit of a knowledge game to be played early on, where you'll have to familiarize yourself with the different kinds of enemies the game can throw at you, but this is nothing new if you've played deckbuilders. Having to think about how your deck fares against different enemy builds encourages planning and being critical of your deck's needs, and the combo-kill system adds incentive to be creative and thoughtful even in the early/easy fights.

The art style might make some folks think this is supposed to be a cute and easy game (it is cute!). It's definitely not easy. Making the most of the game's many challenging situations is something I'm looking forward to in future playthroughs, and if anything changes I may visit this review with an update.

The enemies are cool with good variety in types. Fun story.

Some criticism is that the game is rather easy, I do play a lot of turn-based strategy games but even still, I think if you're new to the genre, you'll quickly find this game easy as well, so maybe start the game on hard (which feels like it should be normal to me). Some abilities are pretty OP, the katana combo for example or the heavy's 6 free weapon blasts, the game quickly snowballs into a rat slaughterfest.

3049,136856614.0,1183800,"This game hooked me right from the start.

I love the graphic style and all the detailed touches in each level.  I'm a big fan of games like XCOM and Darkest Dungeon and this game has successfully blended elements of the two.

In between combat missions is a DD-like ""camping"" scenario where you get to select various buffs and actions that can heal or prepare characters for the upcoming combat.  It is a short but effective way to gear up and get to the next combat mission. Choices matter during this preparation step (especially before you unlock the power up that gives more actions).

Combat is solid and similar to cover mechanics from other turn based games (like XCOM).  Each character feels unique and managing their strengths (and weaknesses) in battle is key for success. I'm only 8 hours into the game so far on my first playthrough but it has been a joy seeing characters take shape as they level up.  Gideon is my fave so far (I love me some sniper overwatch)

I am the type of gamer who will delay starting a new game for fear of a large learning curve up front, but this game got me up to speed quickly with a solid tutorial mission (and compendium).

I love the scenery, i love the idea of the robot creatures, and being able to explore through ruins... but what is it all for? there is no story (and never will be). there is no reasoning for any of it. 
yes you can build - with a very limited toolset but its still possible. you can craft some things. sure. u can scan robots so you can make it yourself and arm them with a couple of guns. they dont do anything but still. There are different biomes to allow you to upgrade your robots to stronger versions with some materials. There is alot of possibility.

BUT

the dev says its content complete.. that there is 50hrs of content. got to 30hrs and already in the last biome. there is no point to scanning the robots because they dont do anything worth while other than to ride. U cant control their shooting when u do put guns on them, they dont harvest anything and there are alot of still frustrating bugs around the robots. 
This game is PLAYABLE.. but not enjoyable IMO. All you do is build, scan dinos for recipes and patterns and for armour you cant even use yet (not implemented yet. considering that its ""there"" i assume it will be?)
The dev states that there will be no more major updates to the game, but yet there is nothing to the armour.. 

There is no story line - dont expect one
There is no end game - Claims there is bosses but still havent found them after opening up the whole map
There is nothing new being added apparently. 
When suggestions are made in the community they are shot down because its not his view of the game. If you just wanted to make a game for yourself then dont publish it. or at least dont charge a stupid amount for such a lacking game. Listed to your community! There is a way to create a game and make a good portion of ur community happy (u will never satisfy everyone - but ur not even satisfying ANYONE that makes suggestions.). Sad part is alot of the suggestions are the same thing and yet it still gets brushed off.. things as simple as map markers (what is implemented is hardly ""map markers"". u dont even know where ur team mates are), Ark had more than this did at its release... THIS game has more potential with a dev that has the ability but no care for the game it seems...

AT LEAST ALLOW FOR WORKSHOP CONTENT BY OTHER PEOPLE!!! then all their bitching of what they want they can make in the workshop for your game and u never have to listen to it again.. its such a shame...

It has SO much potential.. but without a dev that cares.. it wont make squat on what it possibly could.. 

I see this as a dead game and just a money grab for the dev to ""fund"" the 2 other games he is working on.

There's a lot of emphasis on player choice, especially mechanically. The story is fairly linear as of Day 2, but even that has its fair share of decisions that I won't spoil.
The setpieces and UI are nice and smooth, and the band never seems to run out of bangers to play (with some charming lyrics set the rhythm, in text box form). 
But half the time, it'll just crash after an encounter. It's a mild inconvenience since it's remembered the end result each time, and I haven't lost any progress due to this bug. The polish is otherwise top notch.

Pros:
1. Feels much more polished compared to some other VR titles.
2. Game play is fun and engaging.
3. It feels great to get a good group on comms creating a game plan for each round
4. Servers are plentiful and lots of people in them (at least for now).
5. Maps are fun.


Cons:
1. Gun balance I think still could use some work.  It feels like there is no point in using either the free pistol of cyclone; maybe just my lack of experience but it seems to hold true for many others.
2. I feel like 3 S&D and 1 TDM maps is limiting. 
3. Graphics are OKAY.. I mean we are close to CS:GO level.. maybe?  It doesn't look as good as Pavlov imho but.. I do think they focused on making this game run flawlessly.

I beat it in about 2.5 hours, its pretty linear but the level design is functional with some highlights and the art design is pretty strong overall. Scares are OK for the most part, the atmosphere in the first half is strong although there are a few lazy jump scares.
My only major criticism is that the killer AI could use some work in a certain scene to make it feel a bit more tense. Due to the length of said scene, the limitations of the AI become very evident - limiting the overall tension factor.
I would also have liked to see some explanation of the killer's backstory and motives as whilst he has a strong design, he seems very 2D.

3123,136851903.0,"1798010,1798020","Out of all the “baby’s first RPG” titles I’ve played as a child, this is the only series that’s kept me coming back. You play as a schoolboy named Lan, who sends Mega Man into the internet or local networks (dungeons) through various electronic devices where most of the meaningful gameplay happens. You go through simple isometric mazes and solve basic puzzles, pick up cash and items, and get hounded by random encounters. There’s a lot of fetch quests, repetition and archaic RPG design that may turn off a lot of people. None of that matters because Battle Network has peak Action RPG combat.

Combat is a combination of card game and action game where you dodge enemy attacks by moving on a 3x3 grid, while the enemies do the same on another 3x3 grid. You can pick at enemies with your infinite-use Mega Buster but most of your damage will come from using cards (battlechips) with various uses, from simple projectiles to functions like icing the entire stage. You start off being able to draw so many chips and every few seconds you’re able to pause the game to draw some more. Pausing constantly in an action game is usually a bad thing, but here it’s good as it lets you formulate a strategy in the chaos. Enemies have predicable attack patterns, you may think “This guy is gonna jump around twice more and then stop to shoot me, I’ll use this air chip to push him into same row as his friend, and then take them both out at once with this bomb chip!”, things may go awry and then you’ll have to improvise a new plan. As with any card game, your starting hand is randomly selected from the cards you put in your deck, this keeps encounters fresh since you’ll be readjusting on how to best deal with the enemy with whatever you’re dealt. Good deckbuilding is making sure you will never end up with a hand that’s unusable. Skillful play is directly rewarded, your combat speed/efficacy is graded and gives you better rewards at the end of combat the better you do, giving you either more money or chips. You don’t really level up traditionally, but cash is usually handy and chips are you main source of power. Even trash chips are welcome as you can use them to roll on a chip trader, which can give you basically any chip from more garbage to absurdly broken things you would otherwise need to S rank endgame level bosses for. In short, combat is fast, easy-to-understand and has a surprising amount of depth and customization for how simple it looks. Despite the problems these games have with content and balance, I would say the skeleton of this gameplay is basically perfect, and the best successor to Battle Network has cloned these fundamentals 1-to-1. Here’s a rundown of the games themselves.

Battle Network 1: The start of it all. The combat isn’t as good as its sequels but it still has the core of what makes BN combat fun. Unfortunately the game is very rough in typical first-game fashion. It’s short and the mechanics aren’t well developed. The encounter rate is insane. The overworld is a barely-navigable mess with a single tileset and it has one of the worst dungeons ever made. I wouldn’t say you should skip the game without trying it, but if you start getting frustrated with fumbling around in the dark there’s not much shame in going ahead to a much better game.

Battle Network 2: The typical Mega Man sequel where the devs nail it. The game is longer and much more polished. There’s more than one visual theme in the overworld, so it’s possible to navigate now. The combat/deckbuilding mechanics are much better and there’s a new style system where the game buffs you based on your playstyle. For example if you draw a lot of chips you’ll get the Custom style which lets you start a fight with more potential chips to draw, if you use the buster a lot you’ll get the Guts style which buffs the buster. Unfortunately it can be grindy, if you somehow end up with a style you don’t like you’ll have to fight 200+ battles to get another one. You can level up styles by fighting battles, but all it does is strengthen your charge shot. Styles are still a positive addition, giving a lot of customization and depth. BN2 also starts the series’ tendency towards surprisingly extensive post-game content. There’s a lot of collecting/grinding involved if you want to do all of it, but entire areas, sidequests and unique bosses for expert players are only found after the credits roll. This is welcome, especially when a lot of RPGs are still content with giving you one superboss, if anything at all. One problem that will stick with the series is there’s a decent amount of padding added, BN2 adds a lot of mundane fetch quests going back and forth across previously explored internet areas. One such section is atrociously bad, but for the others I’m not gonna complain too much when the game asks me to engage in more combat. All-in-all this is a great game and a big improvement over its predecessor.

Battle Network 3: BN3 takes BN2 and expands it even more. There’s a greater variety of chips, enemies and bosses. There’s a new “NaviCust” system where you place blocks (programs) down a grid to give Mega Man various benefits like a stronger buster or the ability to survive a fatal hit with 1 HP. It’s basically inventory Tetris but with your stats and I wish more games had something like it. They weren’t too sure how to implement it here though, as several parts of the internet/main quest require equipping a program to progress, forcing you to constantly swap out programs or gimp yourself by leaving on something that’s otherwise useless. Styles are back and leveling them up gives you programs for the NaviCust, so you’re encouraged to branch out instead of just sticking with one you like. BN3 is the longest in the series, but there’s also even more padding than 2, which can be grating. On the other hand, BN3 also has an insane amount of postgame content, some say it’s the second half of the game and they’re probably right. If the game were made today content of this size would be paid DLC but it’s just included in the game already, accessible only to the most dedicated players. Times have certainly changed. Unfortunately what has been consistent is Capcom’s love of scummy business practices, this is the first game in the series to have two versions ala Pokemon. Thankfully its not too bad and they’re both in Vol 1. There’s a few chips and one style exclusive to each version, Blue is a bit more favorable due to having an extra boss but otherwise you can pick your favorite color between the two. Despite its problems, BN3 is excellent and one of the best games in the GBA’s library.

I didn’t mention the story, it doesn’t matter at all. It’s episodic children's anime stuff about as meaningful as a classic Mega Man plot, but with more yelling about friendship and hearts. It’s kinda fun thinking about how insane this world and its events are. The first dungeon in the series is a program forcing an oven to spit fire. It’s weirdly prophetic as well, considering how many of the scenarios are about bad guys hacking devices that shouldn’t have been made with any internet access to begin with. But if you want Deus Ex you should look elsewhere.

For what the collection adds, you get Mega Man talking to you on the game select menu, far from necessary but it’s nice. There’s typical extras like art galleries, trophies and a music player. The music is surprisingly good for GBA games, it’s like the system’s audio capabilities were made to make bubbly techno sound good and nothing else. You can import Japanese event exclusive chips which have been basically inaccessible by official means up until now. There’s also online PVP and chip trading to help you collect them all, definitely beats a link cable.

So for Volume 1 you get a rough prototype of a game and two great games. There’s a lot of stuff here, especially if you do post game content. I’d say it’s worth it even at its base price if you value excellent combat above all else.",1.0

This indie horror game is just 1$, but I can't say it's offering more than the price reflects. The game's graphics are nice, but that's about it with this game, the atmosphere is really lacking something to make it scarier and more immersive. Its gameplay is not that fun either because you only have to go from room to room to find the key for the next room (I think I've used the camera or something other than the keys to open one door but the game does not tell you much so I don't know exactly what I did lol). There is only 1 enemy in this game and it seems that it does not follow you everywhere (just on the floor you spawn) and when it catches you, you take damage from him but he does not move at all while attacking you lol. This game really does need some work but it is really cheap and for just 1$ you can support an indie dev and his work.

There isn't even combat in the game yet and i'd rather spend hours building in Fabledom, than play the atrocity that is ""New Allies"", which has combat. 
The graphics are beautiful yet simplistic, game play incredibly smooth, the Prince and Princess mechanic i find to be amazingly unique, you guys really did create something beautiful here. 

The amount of content already in the game as a ""early access"", is incredible and I'm very excited to see what future updates/changes will bring!!!! 

I highly recommend this game to everyone!!!

This game is a pristine, immaculate, Diamond among the rough pebbles, please give this game a try!!!",1.0

3148,136821416.0,1649740,"Thoroughly enjoyed this game; its the first game I've been engaged enough with to try and beat in one sitting (it took two). Gorgeous pixel art, interesting lore/worldbuilding, solid combat, unique and challenging bosses. There are enough different weapons/abilities and enough variety of environments/enemies that I actually felt compelled to try different options, which doesn't always happen for me in these types of games.  I've seen a few negative reviews that dislike the feel of the combat, but to each their own, I suppose. Overall, if you're searching for a minimalist 2D indie Bloodborne, or something that feels a bit like a very challenging Link to the Past, Hunt the Night may be worth checking out.",1.0

It is not easy. You have to reach the entrance of the bunker with 4 chars and a robot. You have 10 different people to chose and 3 different type of robots. Therefore you can find a party that suits you well and also there is room to replay the game. 
There are party skills, people skills and different possibilities to upgrade your weapons. 
Achievements give you points to unlock skills.
The game is not expensive is quite cheap compared with the game content and with other game prices.

1. Asia needs a region lock. I only queue US servers, and in most games I am the only player with ping below 50.
2. Joining dead servers.  I just played 5 games this morning on US servers.  I was only put into low player count lobbies, with less than 4 total people in the game.

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Is it wrong to repay the debt in a dungeon? is a Unity based deck builder card game.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You play as Akane. Your father, Dinard, borrowed a large sum of money. The first two years the interest on the loan was only .0001%, the third year the interest increased to 100% of the principal per month. Fortunately Akane is a Knight in training and a labyrinth has appeared recently and needs to be cleared. The Adventurer's Guild is paying good money to clear the labyrinth.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
This game requires a patch from OTAKU Plan to unlock the adult content. The patch is an executable stored on a Google drive. The executable finds where you have the game installed, I have my games installed in a non-standard location and it had no issue locating it. You can tell if the patch is installed if you see breasts on the title menu. Without the patch there is no nudity and the brothel is not available.

After you get the introduction you head into the labyrinth. Your first trip to the labyrinth is a cake walk. You only have Normal Attack, Defense, and All-Out Attack as your cards. You have three action points per round. There is a symbol over the monster's head as to what they are going to do on their turn. Don't bother with defense if they are not attacking. You are told you can come back the next day to attempt the next level. When you come back you are informed that you can take jobs from the Adventurer's Guild bulletin board and that the jobs you will be able to accept will depend on your level. You are also told of The Lang Shop where you can purchase tools and equipment for the labyrinth. Another option, the Brothel, is mentioned as a third way to earn money. You are given a letter of introduction for the Brothel. After visiting all of the locations you will unlock the status screen where you can select what you want to do.

If you skip the introduction, this is where you will end up. At the map selection screen. The game can be completed in a number of different ways. You can work in the Brothel, as long as you keep your lust down. Most of the scenes are from the brothel. You can do quests from the Adventurer's Guild Bulletin Board. Failed quests are another source of scenes. Failing a quest usually means picking a specific option, and that option isn't obvious. You can kill monsters in the Labyrinth, which is how the game is designed to be played.

There are different phases to the game. Each phase requires you pay the Baron a certain amount of money in a certain time frame. You can ask for an extension, another source of scenes. 

As you enter the Labrinth you may need to select from one or two options. If there is only one option, that is what you have to select. If there are two options you can select the one you want. Frequently encountered options are: Normal or Strong monsters, Chest or Mana Spring, Mana Spring or Strong monster. The Chests contents are similar to what you will encounter when you win a battle. The Mana Spring has three options: Large Heal, Medium Heal with some Magic Stones, Lots of Magic Stones. I frequently ran into Spring were there were no Magic Stones so it was bast to pick the Large Heal. Fights in the Labrinth are one to three monsters. After you successfully complete each battle you will get to choose a reward. This reward can be Magic Stones (Traded in town automatically for gold), Mana, Cards, and Rainbow Crystals.

You can fail up to three fights. When you fail you lose half of your Magic Stones. If you don't think you're going to win the next fight you can go back to town and you will only lose 30% of your Magic Stones (and keep your number of fight losses available the same).

Back in town you can upgrade your cards at the Order of Knights with Mana and Rainbow Crystals. You can purchase consumables (a waste of money in my book) and equipment from the Shop. The Arena can be used to raise your stats. If you completed a dungeon you can pick up your reward at the Adventurer's Guild, along with quests if you desire. You can also work in the Brothel if things aren't going well.

While the images for the scenes are mainly static stills there is audio that goes with them. ;)

Frequently the spacing in the text is off, normally following punctuation like ' and "". While I understand the text in the scenes not being spaced properly, it is a bit distracting for the regular text.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
There are 27 scenes in the gallery. There is an unlock all button if you don't want to try to find them all. The scenes play exactly like they do in the game.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
A good card game on its own. Adult content available only with patch from OTAKU Plan's website.

- Ranking needs to be added faster than 1.0 release, because we don't know what the release date is and waiting for a long ass time could possibly make the game die. 

- We definately need a global leaderboard which shows the top players around the globe, statistically wise such as Top KD, Top Kills, most deaths etc. 

- There definately has to be added a description of what each items does, because there's literally nothing that describes an ability otherwise than just the name of it. 

",1.0
3209,136798987.0,1364020,"After nearly 9 hours playing this game I feel its time to review.

Lets start with the pros.

Graphics and visuals 10/10.
Gun play takes me back to Cod BO2 clean, precise and balanced.
Movement is on point it takes a little getting use to but when you figure it out its truly unique.
Progression is an enjoyable experience and does not feel like a chore (Looking at you MW2.0)
Maps are good fun and a nice balance with some really big maps and some smaller maps as well
loads of choice with how you want to play the maps!

Now for some cons

It does not default you to a region so expect some high ping player you can select a region but some do not or clearly don't want to so you often find a high ping player with a name not written in letters.
The waiting time for the match to start needs halving as its far to long it does jump down when are all players are ready but most of the time there is someone who has not readied up.
Half time is back on Domination ( I love its back but some will hate it i feel its a con more than a pro also that timer needs removing ;D)
You aim at people to tag them its a good feature the con is the XP it gives you that shows up right where the kill confirmed XP shows often leading to you thinking you've killed someone who was only marked.

So after sharing what IMO is the pros and cons of the game I would say with the current state of the game and the price its selling at that its 100% worth getting this game its EA its already being patched and its already better than a lot of other shooters out there in a few months time we could have a really solid shooter set to last for a while so take the leap and pick your copy up today.

3217,136800887.0,1797630,"Great game. I really liked the characters, story, music, and the concept behind the game play. I also absolutely love the ending and twists along the way. 

However, sometimes the players don't make very sound decisions, and using certain abilities exploitatively will guarantee you a win. The game eliminates the person with the least amount of chips after a certain amount of hands, and the last one standing wins. You can use this to your advantage and just fold every hand while you have the chip lead to secure a win as well. Your opponents won't do this so you'll still have a chance sometimes when facing a deficit. With changes to some of the abilities and the opponents actions, I think this game could be a lot better. 

Overall, this game is a blast and is always keeping you in suspense. The poker is fun if you don't take it too seriously, but it could definitely use some improvements. I recommend you give it a try!",1.0

3234,136803783.0,1183800,"Brilliant squad based tactical game with a charming Steampunk aesthetic that I think any fan of X-COM/Xenonauts and any other similar game might want to at least give a cursory glance.

The constant choice between either making for the exit or chancing another turn to get that final bit of loot (that could turn out to be nothing) does wonders for keeping tension high. The game is hard but I wouldn't say it's unfair, mistakes are punished but I haven't (yet) been in any kind of situation where a wrong move has cost me the game and you quickly learn to take your time and move tactically.

That said, there have been a couple of occasions where I've accidentally moved a character into a horribly compromised position without intending to, with no way to undo it which has almost needlessly cost me a squad member's life and has needlessly cost me precious resources to heal them; I think the game might benefit by at least being able to undo a character move (though I would perhaps only have you be able to do so as long as the enemy pod is already in combat and only before any other actions are taken after said move), but since it lacks such a feature at the moment, I'd advise great care where you move your people to!

Plenty of stuff to unlock and add to your game, including what looks to be a wonderful roster of characters who all seem to bring their own unique twist to your squad (I say looks to be as I've only unlocked two of them at the time of this review and so far only rescued one. Yes you have to save them from the rats after unlocking them to recruit them, another cool little feature I think!), and a cool assortment of upgrades to add to your weapons.

Small side note: the upgrades also change the look of the weapon itself, a small aesthetic feature that I've always appreciated in games.

For the asking price I don't think it's worth being without this game in your library if you're even remotely interested in these kind of games, just give it a shot!",1.0

3241,136811268.0,2328760,"The ultimate pinball game has finally arrived at Steam. Do I recommend it? Oh yeah, without a doubt. There's some old tables remastered and some new ones. Some of them are awesome, the others frustrating, but overall great. I like diversity.
Let's first talk about the elephant in the room. There's a lot of reviewers saying they should get the tables for free. I'm really baffled by that. I've never got any game for free. If I wanted a remastered version of the game I had to bought it. You usually get a loyalty discount, like it's the case here, but that's about it. The price tag is high if you want to buy all of them at once, but it's about 3 euros per table which I think it's reasonable. And of course I've bought the whole thing. I know I'm going to sink hundreds of hours into it, so it was a no brainer for me. I've made a mistake only once and I'm still salty about it. Back when Pinball FX2 was out I didn't know I won't be able to buy the rest of the tables after certain date. I would be happy to buy the tables I'm missing, to complete my collection, even though I have all the missing ones in FX3. *Please ZEN unlock that option just for a day :)
The game runs smooth. The physics is quite different, so it will take some time to get used to. Some tables are easier in the old game (the ball is really bouncy on some of the tables here), the others in the new version (I've found Williams tables in particular way easier now), but it's fun to learn new stuff.
Also if you're on the fence, if you should buy the game or not, you actually have every table unlocked for the 24 hours when you first start the game (I think only Marvel tables were on time trial for me). Definitely try before you buy, so you won't regret it. I think that's a great move by the developers.
Now let's talk about the cons. There's one thing that I personaly don't like and that's the achievements. I know I'm probably alone on this one, but I really miss those. There are only 10 general Steam achievements now. You'll unlock 8 of them about 15 minutes after starting the game and leave the other 2 unlocked forever.  But that's not the biggest problem I have with it. Pinball FX2 and Pinball FX3 had the best trophy mechanics in video games. It was what got me into pinball in the first place and why I've left so many hours on those games. The moment when the whole table suddenly paused and that shiny medal spun into view was the most satisfying thing in gaming. Like defeating an impossible boss that gave you trouble for days and weeks and then you finally conquered it. Now there's just a tiny square among dozens, that pop up during the game. I haven't even noticed it until I saw yellow circles bellow some of the table icons in my library. So I really wish those shiny ones were back. But that's just me ranting.
The game's great! See you on the leaderboards! Cheers!

sThe next are more of suggestions I would like to see, upgradable  production facilities. things like the mining operations and coal generator  would be nice to have levels to upgrade to that boost their production to save space or produce at faster rates. Also control of production rates like reducing something to 50% capacity to save costs while still producing. Trade routes... Open up trading between countries that bring in (money, food, Resources) at a regular interval. This would give the player a since of a saving grace if they begin to fall behind producing or need a little push to get them to the next level/area.

3247,136813201.0,1651560,"It's early. Give the devs a chance. It is early access and you can tell a bit. Yet it is still the game I've spent the most time on lately (other than Dredge).

Summary: This is what the original Serf City / The Settlers franchise should have become.

Initial Thoughts:
* CUTE AS CRAP! It's fun, challenging, and cozy at the same time. Unless 1/2 your people die from starvation while the granaries are full. I just love how it looks.
* While a lot of content hasn't been released yet, I still spent SEVEN HOURS playing it the first time. Wow. Didn't even realize it. I was so engaged.
* It's easy to learn and play. Yet as the mid-game starts really happening it can be challenging not having some of the future building.
* Once you hit a good spot (a few hours in) you can let it ""ant farm"" and run on its own and just see what happens. I love that. Will probably stream that happening.
* Mechanics are similar to other games in the genre, yet seem to really flow much better than others games I've played recently.
* Some events, like The W---- (don't want to spoil anything), just seem super random and nothing you can do about it. I get having random events, but I hope long term that mean more or make more sense than just to cripple you for a time.
* I LOVE the simplicity and actual functionality of the Overview Menu. I do so much in there when my area gets big and has lots of Fablings. Other games have either too little or too much information. I don't want to play Excel. This game really does it nicely.

Little Annoyances (There are a few annoying things I'd love to see the devs adjust. And I did send feedback on these. Keep in mind this is early access... just some ideas.):
* The blue road placement icons look exactly like their water indicator. For HOURS I thought that's what they were. Please make them distinctive.
* I'd love to see the road placement indicators AFTER buildings are built too. Like when you click on them. It can help with planning and adjusting as your village evolves.
* Fablings can go up hills, but you can't put roads on hills. Seems odd. Would like that to change.
* Hoping that in the future they can get water from other sources than wells (rivers, springs).
* The UI is big. I'd love being able to adjust the UI elements (like the tool bars and such) as other games in the genre let you. And option to hide it for recording (I LOVE just watching the Fablings). I have an ultra-wide giant monitor and it is still super annoying in the long game.
* A few times zoom got stuck for me. I'd zoom out and it would just zoom all the way in. I'd have to restart it to get it to stop.

Overall, this game is great already. I just can't wait to see what it is a year from now. I'm already addicted and am excited to see where the dev team and designers are going to take it.",1.0

3255,136814124.0,1798010,"Out of all the “baby’s first RPG” titles I’ve played as a child, this is the only series that’s kept me coming back. You play as a schoolboy named Lan, who sends Mega Man into the internet or local networks (dungeons) through various electronic devices where most of the meaningful gameplay happens. You go through simple isometric mazes and solve basic puzzles, pick up cash and items, and get hounded by random encounters. There’s a lot of fetch quests, repetition and archaic RPG design that may turn off a lot of people. None of that matters because Battle Network has peak Action RPG combat. 

Combat is a combination of card game and action game where you dodge enemy attacks by moving on a 3x3 grid, while the enemies do the same on another 3x3 grid. You can pick at enemies with your infinite-use Mega Buster but most of your damage will come from using cards (battlechips) with various uses, from simple projectiles to functions like icing the entire stage. You start off being able to draw so many chips and every few seconds you’re able to pause the game to draw some more. Pausing constantly in an action game is usually a bad thing, but here it’s good as it lets you formulate a strategy in the chaos. Enemies have predicable attack patterns, you may think “This guy is gonna jump around twice more and then stop to shoot me, I’ll use this air chip to push him into same row as his friend, and then take them both out at once with this bomb chip!”, things may go awry and then you’ll have to improvise a new plan. As with any card game, your starting hand is randomly selected from the cards you put in your deck, this keeps encounters fresh since you’ll be readjusting on how to best deal with the enemy with whatever you’re dealt. Good deckbuilding is making sure you will never end up with a hand that’s unusable. Skillful play is directly rewarded, your combat speed/efficacy is graded and gives you better rewards at the end of combat the better you do, giving you either more money or chips. You don’t really level up traditionally, but cash is usually handy and chips are you main source of power. Even trash chips are welcome as you can use them to roll on a chip trader, which can give you basically any chip from more garbage to absurdly broken things you would otherwise need to S rank endgame level bosses for. In short, combat is fast, easy-to-understand and has a surprising amount of depth and customization for how simple it looks. Despite the problems these games have with content and balance, I would say the skeleton of this gameplay is basically perfect, and the best successor to Battle Network has cloned these fundamentals 1-to-1. Here’s a rundown of the games themselves.

Battle Network 1: The start of it all. The combat isn’t as good as its sequels but it still has the core of what makes BN combat fun. Unfortunately the game is very rough in typical first-game fashion. It’s short and the mechanics aren’t well developed. The encounter rate is insane. The overworld is a barely-navigable mess with a single tileset and it has one of the worst dungeons ever made. I wouldn’t say you should skip the game without trying it, but if you start getting frustrated with fumbling around in the dark there’s not much shame in going ahead to a much better game.

Battle Network 2: The typical Mega Man sequel where the devs nail it. The game is longer and much more polished. There’s more than one visual theme in the overworld, so it’s possible to navigate now. The combat/deckbuilding mechanics are much better and there’s a new style system where the game buffs you based on your playstyle. For example if you draw a lot of chips you’ll get the Custom style which lets you start a fight with more potential chips to draw, if you use the buster a lot you’ll get the Guts style which buffs the buster. Unfortunately it can be grindy, if you somehow end up with a style you don’t like you’ll have to fight 200+ battles to get another one. You can level up styles by fighting battles, but all it does is strengthen your charge shot. Styles are still a positive addition, giving a lot of customization and depth. BN2 also starts the series’ tendency towards surprisingly extensive post-game content. There’s a lot of collecting/grinding involved if you want to do all of it, but entire areas, sidequests and unique bosses for expert players are only found after the credits roll. This is welcome, especially when a lot of RPGs are still content with giving you one superboss, if anything at all. One problem that will stick with the series is there’s a decent amount of padding added, BN2 adds a lot of mundane fetch quests going back and forth across previously explored internet areas. One such section is atrociously bad, but for the others I’m not gonna complain too much when the game asks me to engage in more combat. All-in-all this is a great game and a big improvement over its predecessor.

Battle Network 3: BN3 takes BN2 and expands it even more. There’s a greater variety of chips, enemies and bosses. There’s a new “NaviCust” system where you place blocks (programs) down a grid to give Mega Man various benefits like a stronger buster or the ability to survive a fatal hit with 1 HP. It’s basically inventory Tetris but with your stats and I wish more games had something like it. They weren’t too sure how to implement it here though, as several parts of the internet/main quest require equipping a program to progress, forcing you to constantly swap out programs or gimp yourself by leaving on something that’s otherwise useless. Styles are back and leveling them up gives you programs for the NaviCust, so you’re encouraged to branch out instead of just sticking with one you like. BN3 is the longest in the series, but there’s also even more padding than 2, which can be grating. On the other hand, BN3 also has an insane amount of postgame content, some say it’s the second half of the game and they’re probably right. If the game were made today content of this size would be paid DLC but it’s just included in the game already, accessible only to the most dedicated players. Times have certainly changed. Unfortunately what has been consistent is Capcom’s love of scummy business practices, this is the first game in the series to have two versions ala Pokemon. Thankfully its not too bad and they’re both in Vol 1. There’s a few chips and one style exclusive to each version, Blue is a bit more favorable due to having an extra boss but otherwise you can pick your favorite color between the two. Despite its problems, BN3 is excellent and one of the best games in the GBA’s library.

I didn’t mention the story, it doesn’t matter at all. It’s episodic children's anime stuff about as meaningful as a classic Mega Man plot, but with more yelling about friendship and hearts. It’s kinda fun thinking about how insane this world and its events are. The first dungeon in the series is a program forcing an oven to spit fire. It’s weirdly prophetic as well, considering how many of the scenarios are about bad guys hacking devices that shouldn’t have been made with any internet access to begin with. But if you want Deus Ex you should look elsewhere.

For what the collection adds, you get Mega Man talking to you on the game select menu, far from necessary but it’s nice. There’s typical extras like art galleries, trophies and a music player. The music is surprisingly good for GBA games, it’s like the system’s audio capabilities were made to make bubbly techno sound good and nothing else. You can import Japanese event exclusive chips which have been basically inaccessible by official means up until now. There’s also online PVP and chip trading to help you collect them all, definitely beats a link cable.

So for Volume 1 you get a rough prototype of a game and two great games. There’s a lot of stuff here, especially if you do post game content. I’d say it’s worth it even at its base price if you value excellent combat above all else.",1.0
3256,136811469.0,2273470,"After just doing the tutorial and assembling a single guitar, I wasn't sure if the game play loop would be enjoyable enough to warrant the 20 or so minutes it takes to complete the building process. But I gave it one more go without the tutorial, turning off the in-game music and putting on an Bomb the Music Industry! album I haven't heard before (SCRAMBLES), and found how the games starts to shine.

The act of juggling around multiple orders at a time makes the game play much more interactive. While a majority of the parts are pre-chosen by the customer, the user still gets to make some active decisions based on what's in stock, the desired quality and/or cost of the build, and a bit of creative freedom like the material of the body or the shape of the fret board markers. All the while, I found myself passively appreciating and critiquing the customer's choices as the guitar's body and colors start to form, looking at each one as though it was a real guitar. And since the game play wasn't too demanding, I was able to fully digest the music in the background, giving me a new way to activity listen to music outside of driving.

While there is still much to be explored that is locked in the prologue (working on new instruments, market/stock management, expanding/upgrading the workshop, mastering material proficiency, brand globalization, etc.) there are still plenty of areas in the game play that leaves some desires (such as not being able to wire/solder the electronics, no bridge adjustments, and the lack of responsiveness when strumming while playing the instrument). But overall the game seems very promising and is worth giving a shot by any music fan. Looking forward to what is added in the full release.

P.S. (Highly recommend trying it with your favorite music in the background. While I enjoyed the in-game music, substituting it transcends the experience.)",1.0

Protagonist goes to job/does mundane task but bad things are going on in the area, well doing said task/job spooky stuff happens and eventually the killer comes and you have to escape/confront said killer. 

It doesn't really tread any new ground, but I wouldn't say it is a bad game. Puzzles are enjoyable, I loved the chase music (it made the game feel like a cheesy b-movie which was a fun move), and the environments look nice. The biggest downside for me is that the game just isn't that scary. The atmosphere falls flat for me. I wasn't at all unsettled, just jump scared a few times. 

I had an enjoyable two hours, but I wouldn't recommend this one over games like Bloodwash or Murder House that  handled the formula better in my opinion. It's a solid 7/10 game for me.",1.0

This is a team game like siege, but without the special abilities (Which is perfect), special abilities would not work in the form of this game imo.

3263,136812422.0,1941780,"This game is very fun, sure its just run around and loot + Shoot now, but its obvious there is love put into this game.

I feel like most people have the issue where it feels repetitive but that's where games like this are the strongest. The Dev put it under the About section saying gameplay is subject to change and be more based on base building survival mixed with the elements already there. I played Solo and honestly it's still fun, but this game is also my cup of tea.

I can't wait to see how the game does in terms of development and moving forward because in my opinion it handles the wave survival genre really well.

Pros:
-Enemies have a chance to drop loot
-Bosses feel like a proper challenge especially where they are spawned at
-Loadouts before game starting makes it worth going for the bosses for unlocks
-Melee combat feels good when needing to conserve ammo and doesn't feel like a last option
-Different item types to let you build different ways as you explore
-The map telling you which houses have weapons is a nice touch to let you know what a starting goal is after spawning

Cons:
-Items feel scarce sometimes with having empty houses especially later in the game when healing and energy is really needed
-Stamina runs out pretty fast with it being drained by Sprinting,Rolling, and Jumping
-The area's all look the same so getting lost is very easy (Opening the map fixes this issue easily, but for some who have a hard time flicking between having map open and closed it can be challenging for some but not a big Con honestly)

I feel like as this game develops it will become a hit for friends to just hop on to have a good time and chill. and that overall is what makes it a good game in my opinion.",1.0

The music and art of this game are exceptional, and the exploration is very satisfying, especially when any part of the environment could be a key to understanding a key piece of lore.

The game does an AMAZING job of encouraging the player to engage in the lore, with many puzzles being tied directly to it. I dont think they are so complicated that you need a full understanding of the lore or anything close to it, but by asking the player to even lightly interact with the lore to progress, it gives a base level understanding of the world and story being told even to a player who may otherwise not be reading things or thinking about it.

Now, I know not everyone is into the storytelling side of things, and as far as game play goes, I have been thoroughly enjoying learning the combat. For me, the combat is secondary to what really makes this game so amazing, but it is still fun. The boss fights have been challenging but not frustrating so far, which I always appreciate.

I thought peasants would leave if they were homeless for too long since that's what the writing implied, but they just straight up starved to death without a home and dropped dead at the 'plaza.' So I unintentionally euthanized a third of my people when trying to replace peasants with common folk from lack of space. Then my common folk also began starving too- I'm wondering if ""They're more demanding"" means they consume more food? I got confused there.

Anyhow, after mass murdering dozens of people I made a new save and it's going great...

Coal makers feel highly inefficient with little employment, slow production, low desirability, and high upkeep after so many of them- only for the game to not even react if my people don't have coal to heat their homes in the winter. So I opted to just let them freeze since it's easy to ignore with no consequence. Coal makers are definitely my least favorite building in the game.

I hope the next neighboring ruler is a guy who looks... a touch more handsome than Giovanni... his character design is creative, funny, and unique- but I'm -not- that desperate. Oh dear.

I'd love a preview of what royalty/nobility points could unlock for me in the future. For now, I didn't care too much- though the pop up quests not having an option to decline without penalty (especially early on in the game) stressed me out. It felt like time was rolling the dice as to whether I was punished or punished less harshly, especially when struggling with money and food already. Hell, an option to turn those off for a more relaxing experience would be great too. It reminded me of sim city's random destruction events.

My least important peeve was the cake-like fog around the border edge of the map. Kinda kills my immersion when I view a map and the visual horizon from my camera doesn't match up, but I also have no idea how this could be fixed and I can see why the developers picked such a solution for now at least.

But for $60 (and I feel spoiled saying this cause I know it's only $10 a game or $6 if you include all versions) I expected more. This is literally the bare minimum and if this version didn't give you online battle and trading abilities the emulated versions would not only serve the same purpose for free but would actually be better. You would be able to have a black border that doesn't ruin oled screens, remap buttons, toggle run, fast forward, and save state for all the shitty stupid not fun parts. This version doesn't fix any of the old translation errors which is infuriating. ""Go left to get to the netdealer. Turn right at the square and follow the big path."" Apparently that means the netdealer is on the left and the square is to the right. Nonsensical. The left bumper ""hint"" is still useless garbage. Hmm I'm doing a quest so I can take the exam. What was the quest again or where am I supposed to go? Lemme ask for a hint. The hint just says lets finish the quest so we can take the exam. Like you seriously couldn't go back through and give real hints? So then you either look up a guide or jack out and run halfway across town to see what the quest was or where you are supposed to go. Can't set spoken and written languages separately. The graphics suck. I know I get it it's an old game but they said they remade it. You really couldn't upscale at all? You literally have to make the window smaller than your screen for it to look decent. Which leaves you with the border which can't be made plain black and is super ugly. Even if you play at full size there is still side borders because they didn't bother to make the game wide screen. There is some filter that is supposed to make it look better but it looks worse. And on top of all this stupid other bullshit they put denuvo on it which makes no sense because the only reason not to emulate the game is for the online capabilities. If somebody pirated this version it wouldn't have online and at that point it would just be worse than an emulator. There is literally no reason to pirate this version and they slap denuvo on it anyway and now people with steam decks and laptops can't play on the go without an internet connection. Idk man like I'm keeping the game and going to play because I don't have anything else I wanna play right now and I do want to trade and battle online and AGAIN THESE ARE REALLY FUN GAMES but this is just such a lazy minimal port that I can't recommend it for $60. Which again I feel bad saying knowing it's $6 a game but shit man they could have at least tried instead of coasting on the fact that online play would make this the only option. Very disappointing overall. If you aren't going to play online just get an emulator. There apparently is some previously japanese exclusive content in this version that wouldn't be in the emulated one but idk if that alone is worth $60 if you aren't going to play online.

There isn't anything wrong with it, with those nudity scenes throughout it's perfectly stellar. But when you look at it as a choice, you realize just how flawed you and the rest of humanity is.

What drove me to purchase such a game? What part of my soul felt so empty that I thought a virtual girl could fill it?

I don't understand why so much time was spent on raytracing when most gamers don't spend that kind of money on video cards, let alone people who play pinball.

I don't get what they were doing with the program in Early Access as it feels like it's still early access.

It's going to be a lot harder to enjoy it with less than 1/4 of my friends buying a single bundle of 3 tables.

Part of what I enjoyed in FX3 was competition and I made friends through it.

Wait until bugs are fixed and maybe a better discount is offered to FX3 customers.

3330,136829954.0,2328760,"After a bumpy birth, Pinball FX's debut on steam is off to a strong start. The Williams tables especially are of high quality. Great physics, great graphics, and integrated cabinet mode. They play exceedingly well, and I look forward to future releases. There are more improvements to be made, but it's off to a great start.

Initially a 1-year exclusive on another platform, tables were only purchasable in-game with tickets, The benefit of this was ostensibly cross-platform play, but the downside is that players would have been locked into the developers eco-system. 

Over the course of a year, and a lot of negative feedback, the developer changed their approach to allow direct-DLC purchases after it debuted on steam as they had on previous iterations of their pinball games. Players that purchased tables on other platforms were given a 1-time form to fill out to transfer tables to a single platform of their choice. 

Likewise, steam will detect if you own a table on Pinball FX3 and give users a 50% off credit to purchase the license for Pinball FX.",1.0

It is very cute though, with stylistic decisions I can get behind. I also like how they're making some of the structures less static than just placing squares and rectangles. They do need to extend this to more buildings than just housing and stockpiles though.

The biggest problem right now is that the ""fable"" part of the name is fairly cosmetic at this point. We are dealing with pigs with wings, there's a princess, and a talking tree somewhere on the map. Otherwise, it's just a regular city builder like you've played before. I've built the well for my houses in so many games. I've built the tavern to make my people happy countless times before. I've built the wheat farms for my windmills for my bakeries every year since playing Settlers II back on windows 98. Let me build and set up actual fable stuff.

3405,136834350.0,1922010,"This game is EXTREMELY good, if you liked Classic Siege, this is an absolute treat. The guns feel very satisfying, the reloads and grabbing are very slightly confusing, but just take some getting used to, and overall, the level of interactivity is moderately low, but just enough that it keeps the balance of the game in tact. 

Eco/weapons feel very similar to Valorant or CSGO, with the tiers for purchasing weapons, weapon classifications, and damage feeling more similar to Valorant. If you understand some of the buys there, things are very uncomplicated. There's good weapon variety, and I actually think that the reload system (you simply drop the mag and put a new one in, then wait for the weapon to be ready) evens out the skill gap present in reloading VR guns. I'm mixed on this because I am very fast at reloading guns, but it also allows more people to engage with the game elements in a deeper way if they aren't muddled down in the moment to moment reloads. 

The actual gameplay loop is extremely similar to when Siege first came out, with a slight mix of CS style throwables for good measure. Breaking down windows, clearing hallways, creating entries, it's all here aside from fully destroy-able walls. There are set breaching spots, but as I'm sure the designers of siege learned, that specific breach spots are probably for the best in terms of balance. Soft walls are a nightmare to balance around, and this game reaches a happy medium. 

The gadgets are all moderately futuristic, and with a very polished, cohesive tutorial, it all feels quite intuitive. ""Ease of use"" is a very nice way to put how most of the gadgets feel, aside from maybe grenades being that they have a higher skill ceiling inherently. 

The gunplay feels great, the guns all sound very chunky and powerful, even the default pistol sounds adequately loud. Big pluses all around. 

Movement is surprisingly smooth, with the ever looming threat of VR sickness, it's hard to find a game that sets this level of smooth movement, and does it in a way that (to me) feels extremely good. If you feel comfortable playing Pavlov, you're gonna be just fine here more than likely. 

That being said, Pavlov is a much more community focused game, whereas this game feels nearly competitive ready. The ability to see people only when teammates see them after death, the limitations on crouching, the ease of use, and the balance of weapons and gadgets, all of these are typically afterthoughts from developers after creating ""just another VR shooter"" but this game is one of the most polished, thorough experiences I've had so far in VR. This is, if you're into shooters, probably a must buy. Sure, there are lots of Quest players with dying headsets, and the audience might be a bit young, but that certainly doesn't take away from how great this game plays and feels. 

For the first time in a while, I got out of VR after getting a server disconnection, and as I write this I'm like, ""dang, I want to play more"" which hasn't happened in a very long time in VR.",1.0

* Unable to turn down/off audio of in-game announcer (the lady that yells about objectives).

* Recommend to hire a community manager or assign someone internally that is fluent in English to deliver better communication around the game to the non-China playerbase.

* Hopes of longer/larger/PvE/PvPvE game modes. Right now, running a short match with a small player count, going back to main menu, another quick game, main menu, quick game, main menu, it just isn't great for long-term replayability. I played 2 hours and felt like I went through 20 matches which wore me out.

* Accessibility options that may help with character rotation in space. This is one of those inevitable games where you'll feel the vertigo/motion sickness. Something that would allow forcing a vertical map so your character is unable to rotate with feet always at what would be considered the ground. I understand this could take away from immersion or the whole reason you're playing a game in space, but it's also not unreasonable if it can decrease player count because of uncontrollable dizziness. I also don't see the 'well if you can't flip around you're at advantage' - on the contrary, I would think players that can would have the advantage.

* You've spent years developing the most realistic FPS in space - why bog it down with cartoony/comedy skins and attachments and break the immersion? I'm sure the answer is that 'it sells', but this deserved to be mentioned. Imagine if the cosmetics and skins were military-esque or futuristic, as they should be?

While I haven't come across every enemy type yet there are a wide variety of vermin to deal with, such as you rats with shivs, snipers and a few others I won't mention as to not spoil the fun! You can try and deal with the vermin as they approach - but be warned that you will be overrun in a matter of rounds if they get out of hand.

During the turn based phase you can potentially find supplies that will help you once you reach a shelter. Once there you can create items, upgrade weapons and heal your soldiers to fight another day. You also get a little robot companion which is nice! DO NOT LET THEM DIE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!

- A fun gameplay loop that becomes repetitive after 4-5 scenarios. 
- Almost every scenario is moving left to right on the map, killing rats that appear predictably from corridors bordering the map. There is not much replay value, and maps are very linear.
- Not nearly as many scenario types (rescue missions, etc.) as XCOM.
- You'll either like the pixelart or dislike it. For me, it's a bit too pixely - I had trouble at times telling certain characters apart.
- Music and sounds are fantastic. Probably the best part of the game for me.
- The game is moderately challenging. It's not 'easy' as some might say, but once you learn the basic mechanics it's not hard to figure out the best placements for characters. 
- Each character has a mostly different role, though some are definitely more useful than others.
- The story is not very good; neither is the theme, at least not for me. It's mostly just there to provide an excuse to do some turn based tactics gameplay.
- The price is exactly where it should be for this game.

I sound negativem, but the game is still quyite fun for what it is. Don't expect the variety or polish of XCOM. Mechanics are shallow, but the gameplay loop of turn based tactics is satisfying enough, and the game is short enough, to make it worth it for the price.

The detail in the houses/decorations make towns feel more real and alive. It's fun to just sit back and watch the world go.

There are some kinks to work out in regards to food supply imo, but nothing game breaking at the moment. It seems as if almost 1/2 of my land is devoted to vegetables, creating a constant need of an army of low level citizens to run them (farms are one of the, if not the, only building limited to low level citizens). But this seems like something that will likely be tweaked, or remedied by higher level food sources/buildings we don't have access to yet. 

I love the little event scenarios you can uncover. I've had a few that give some cosmetic decorations, and one that gave a permanent buff (and was a talking tree. love that). Hoping to see more of the later, so the events can feel more impactful and permanent in the world.

3460,136840475.0,1567000,"I think this is mostly good and very impressive for being a solo dev project.
The art style is amazing, and I love the environments for most of the levels, with the city, the dali world, and the 2nd to last level being the highlights and my favorite levels in general. 

Shooting is very basic and turning enemies into gore is always fun, but the gunplay and enemy variety is probably the weakest part of the game, especially since by the halfway point you've seen everything and the game never throws new mechanics at you.

Music is also good. The last thing I'll say is with an aesthetic this great I wish there was a little more going on with narrative, and things that tied the levels and characters together, because it's close to feeling cohesive and interesting but nothing really backs it up. I do like that what little story there is, is told entirely visually.

I think if the dev decides to do another project I'd love to see a slower paced exploration, puzzle or even horror game that really gives you time to milk the art design and environments",1.0
3461,136839776.0,1567000,"Love this game. I plan to do a full video review at some point, but I'll summarize my feelings here for now. 20 dollars and a 3-hour first playthrough well-spent.

There is no real story to this game. By the dev's own admission. I...kinda hate that John Carmack ""story in video games is like story in porn"" quote, but I do like how little is elaborated on here. It doesn't just leave things open to interpretation, but it also leaves the game unshackled from any kind of ""canon"" it has to build on. With that said, the little setpieces and environmental storytelling does create this sense of a connected experience I quite enjoy.

Speaking of setpieces and environments, this game oozes style. Every level is distinct in aesthetic, and often uses assets entirely unique form other levels. It's creepy and cartoony and deliciously visceral. I believe it's heavily implied to be a sort of dream that the player is experiencing. To that end, I kind of wish there was more abstract level design. Maybe titles like Anemoiopolis and MyHouse.wad spoiled me too much, but despite the surreal environments, the worlds often feel surprisingly grounded and cohesive. If there were ever any sort of sequel to this title, I hope the dev leans into things like what they did with the mirrors in Mystique House and go all-out with that non-euclidian space warping. I love that stuff any day of the week, and I cannot get enough.

Oh yeah and the OST slaps like a motherfucker. I've been calling it ""Burtoncore,"" since that seems to evoke the sense of what you can expect from it. synthey, playful, but at the same time sinister and foreboding.

The gameplay is pretty simple. You got a jump and a double jump, and a bunch of guns that will feel pretty familiar to your average FPS enjoyer. Notable exceptions to this are the Microwave Gun - a replacement for your standard automatic which has the notable benefit of blowing up enemies if you can train your beam on them long enough. Think the Amid Evil Voltride, but much easier to pull off consistently. Also, the Worm Gun. I love the Worm Gun. One of the most unique and interesting guns in the game - and most fps games. Shoot a leech at your foes, set it and forget it (sorta like a Blood Flare Gun), but once it does its business, the leech becomes saturated with blood - and depending how much it got to feed, you can, uh...eat it. And heal up to 10hp! Try using it on the Pigbots!

Even though most of the other weapons don't do anything terribly unique, they still feel great. You'll pick up an AR later on which is functionally superior to your base Shotgun in every way, but I still used the Shotgun. Because shooting it felt great and so does the flip-cock. I'm a sucker for flips and cock. We've all seen Grenade Launchers, but Illwill's firing speed and arc feels so satisfying. Once you play around with it a bit, it can start feeling almost second-nature to land direct hits with it. It isn't quite Blood TNT levels of intuition, but it's very close.

That said, there is some bloat to the weapon roster. Some redundancy in your guns. Regundancy, if you will. I think the game could remove the Rocket Launcher, Assault Rifle, and Soul Extractor, and not lose much besides additional ammo pools. The Soul Extractor is kind of interesting - killing Painheads with it won't cause them to explode when they die, and as far as I can tell, it prevents the target from shooting at you - but it's really just a high-damage automatic, and its little nuances rarely play a factor in how you use it.

The weapon balance migh have some misses in my option, but the enemy balance is EXCELLENT. Every enemy has a unique role, and the ways they play off of eachother, around the arenas, and against you makes for some great-feeling combat.

One other thing I'd like to mention: I really love the game's secret collectible. By collecting one of the three violins in each level, the player can increase their damage within that level by 10% - up to 30% with all 3. What a cool little reward for exploration! If you got good secret-hunting skills, you're rewarded with shorter kill times on automatics and in some cases, better kill thresholds on your shotguns and explosives! I really like that. :)

Overall, I'd give this game a 4/5. Really good, solid title. I really like a lot of the systems here. But it could stand to be refined a little. If I ever see DLC or a followup to this in the future, I'll be snapping it up in an instant. Until then, I'm gonna 100% the shit outta this game.",1.0

3477,136843308.0,1649740,"If I had to describe [i]Hunt the Night[/i] in it's current state, I would say it feels unfinished, almost like it should have been released in early access for some extra polish.

Don't get me wrong, there's a lot going for the game: the pixel art, the music, the atmosphere, the world-building, the puzzles.

But there's just so many bad and confusing design choices that, despite 100%ing the game, leave me not wanting to recommend it until they work on it a bit more.

The biggest issue I have is with the combat: enemies have busted hitboxes, hit just a little too hard, and the combat is too clunky to allow you to handle encounters effectively. There's no animation-cancelling and no permanent way beyond gear to increase your attack or defense, just your HP, and beyond the max healing charges of 5, lifesteal is your only way of getting health back despite not working on everything. You can also poison enemies, but the proc chance and damage are so low it's almost not worth it.

The encounter design in particular is absolutely awful, with the game often swarming you with dozens of enemies, projectiles, or both that respawn between load screens despite the clunky combat not allowing you to handle multiple things going on at once very well. [spoiler]There's also a few bosses that ask the question of, ""what if it was the same encounter but now there's two of them? Or what if they can spawn trash mobs infinitely?""[/spoiler]

There are also quite a few enemies that, while they do telegraph their attacks, have such a short reaction window that you're almost guaranteed to take damage from them unless you pick them off using a ranged attack. [spoiler]The invisible guys in particular are extremely annoying to deal with in packs for this reason[/spoiler].

And considering combat, the most tedious aspect of the game, is also the core focus of the game, I found myself opting to run past all of the enemies after a certain point because it was not worth the time it took to fight them.

There's also a few small things I had issue with, such as:

• The dash allowing you to fall off ledges or into bodies of liquid, only for the game to spawn you across the map or in another room entirely instead of the last surface you were standing on
• Cutscenes replaying after failing to defeat certain bosses, instead of skipping straight to the encounter
• One-way trips not having a confirmation before yeeting you into the abyss, resulting in needless backtracking
• Area transitions that are poorly signposted save for some different lighting on the floor
• No maps, although most areas aren't too difficult to navigate
• Hunts not being marked as complete at the tavern
• No audiovisual feedback when your dark energy is full or cooldown is over
• No bestiary or game stats menu
• Not enough weapon, gear, and enemy variety
• Bizzare and jarring load-stutters when saving or transitioning to a new area

Also, there's a pretty major softlock after completing a puzzle (that resets itself if you get it wrong for some reason) in the final dungeon, [spoiler]Bloodisfell Cathedral,[/spoiler] and some other bugs such as levers getting stuck, players not being able to attack, getting stuck in geometry, and  item pickup notifications not appearing or using the wrong template. [spoiler]The Apothecary keys didn't have notifications and the white snake scale used the default NPC dialogue instead of the item notification[/spoiler].

But with all that being said I definitely think the game is worth keeping an eye on, so give it a few months or wait for a sale if it looks interesting.

Pros: 
- Cute dog/cat animations when playing with toys
- Diversity in pets with inclusion of fish, rabbits, turtles
- Pet 'perks' (should be called traits..) add good diversity to gameplay

Cons:
- The mini-games for playing with pets are a bit boring, and often feel unnecessary or slow. If they were more entertaining and fast paced, the experience would be better
- Dogs/Cats can clip through walls, fences, gates, doors etc. I released my dogs into my yard and had to chase them all across the world to get them back. And I had a cat who just couldn't be contained.
- Having to manually input booking info isn't a good gameplay choice as it adds nothing but a bit of annoyance. I'd remove it, and have booking info input automatically after you accept the pet through a phone call.
- There should be an option to adopt your own pet that can free-roam the hotel whilst you're there, it'd be fun to name one and look after it yourself.

3509,136877514.0,1714250,"First I'd like to reiterate, I adored the prologue, I've played too many hours of it, so it's with a heavy heart that I can't currently recommend this game.

I will say, the decorating tool is one of the best I've seen in any game, at all, it's outstanding that we have triple A titles that cost hundreds to be complete, yet this comes along and blows it out of the water from graphics to accessibility/creating. 

However, I feel like the 2 modes we get on starting up the game, leave something to be desired for. Challenge mode, which is the only ""career"" mode feels like it throws you in the deep end, I restarted 4 times alone because the amount of animals to handle from day one was overwhelming to say the least. Every room was full, most animals had low needs from the get go, even after cleaning, clipping, washing, feeding, double checking feeding, then play, play play, and boom I hadn't enough time before an animal had serious mood decay. 

Then sandbox mode goes the extreme in the other way, nothing feels like it matters, the challenge is gone which was a main draw for me to enjoy this game, I'd like the game a lot more with a balanced experience, I feel like there isn't much in between the animals moods all decaying, which feels totally random aswell. I remember having to feed a single fish 3 times in a single day and by the time I had done this single thing, 5 animals all needed to be played with in separate, slow interactions.

Unfortunately I don't wanna beat a dead horse, I hope in future updates the balancing is expanded more as this game has some of the most perfect ingredients I've come across in a simulation/Strategy game, it gives me old Nintendogs and relaxing time wasters, it's just the strategy needs some polishing for me to feel I can enjoy it yet :)

Forgetting why you love what you do, or that you loved it once, because others are throwing stones at you when you try following your passion.

This game is about nature, but for me it felt so much like it wasn't ""only"" about the nature outside, but although the nature of creativity/ideas inside of us (our mind, heart or soul or whatever you want to call it) which are being destroyed or forgotten over the time of our life.

The mini games were nice, diverse and satisfying to play and watch. I liked how the character watched the grass growing. And collecting the birds and clouds, or drawing the star constellations without knowing what the final shape would be.

When I started the fragile mode, I wasn't sure if there was a point in trying to ""clean"" the moon, or if I was meant to fail. But in the end I made it. The fragile mode was definitely a challenge compared to the first story mode, but it was a fair one.

3519,136879299.0,2239870,"Small People Defense is a charming tower defense title. The price point is staggeringly low and for the amount of content you get, it's an absolute steal. It's only in early access but the game already feels so fluid and fun!

I am a huge fan of tower defense and generally try to play as many of them as I can and this is one of the better titles I've seen recently. The unique interactions between towers are challenging to use and the added strategic depth is a welcome addition.

The first few levels I played had me restricted to only 2 towers but I still had difficulties completing them with 3 stars (you get ranked out of 3). However, this didn't seem to affect the amount of points I had to spend in the out-of-game upgrade screen to too much of a significant degree which I felt was fair and nicely done.

You quickly gain access to more towers, more levels and upgrades. The strategies and enemy variety are great and I cannot wait to play more. I especially like how each tower has an individual targeting behavior instead of merely targeting the closest target. For example, the fire tower targets only enemies that are not yet ""on fire"" and as such spreads the debuff evenly between them, which is a fantastic mechanic in my opinion.

The points you gain from completing levels can be spent on upgrades that provide more starting money, more HP for your base, higher DPS for whichever tower you choose and so on. They are also spent on unlocking new levels. The points required for new level unlocks are again fair and not at all costing the world which means the developer respects your time and doesn't force you to grind constantly to unlock things.

The way towers work in the game was a refreshing change as well, they use a projectile based system where placement of towers actually has a profound effect on how efficient each tower is. For example, place a tower perpendicular and far away from the enemy path? You're going to have problems killing much at all! But place it in line or along the angle of the path? Now you'll be cooking with gas! This is just one of many things I noticed in the game that I really appreciated.

The only thing I would like to see implemented is a way to toggle/an option in the game menu to see an overlay of what upgrade level each tower has without you having to run to it with your character and checking, so seeing it at a glance would be beneficial. Especially in larger levels where you may not be able to manage many towers too easily. The upgrades are represented already as each tower grows larger in size but this is sometimes a little obtuse as you may not easily notice the difference between level 5 or level 6. A minor thing to be sure but it would definitely be a welcome improvement.

Overall, I have a lot of fun with the game and I hope to be able to find some time to play more soon!",1.0
3520,136878994.0,847780,"A good introduction to the mechanics and the world, but it can't stand on its own because of the excessive fourth-wall breaking and unplayable combat on the hardest setting.

The vibrant graphics are the first thing you notice. Although the art style has been seen before and it’s not particularly original, it somehow makes the game stand out. The game has a third-person view with a rotatable camera when you're outside, but as soon as you enter a house or other enclosed area, the camera switches to a static top-down view.

The story is filled with comedy and moments where characters break the fourth wall. In my opinion, they go too far with these. Everything has to be a joke, a reference to something modern, the awareness of being in a videogame, etc. 

The characters mainly smile and move around in smooth animations with a few different facial expressions to convey mood. Talking to people is done very well. To ensure that you don't miss anything, whenever they speak, a speech bubble appears over their head. While the majority of them may be easily ignored if you don't want to hear their mundane words, you must pay attention to the blue speech bubbles that advance the plot.

However, interaction with the world adopts a traditional style that makes things easy to overlook. What I mean by this is that hotspots aren’t marked. Some things like chests are obvious, but some are very random. You might try interacting with several cupboards and get no feedback, but then you interact with another that looks exactly the same and find something new. Even though these are optional and solely contribute to the world-building, it’s still a shame to hide them like this.

The world has a distinctive appearance since it is formed of blocks. With the exception of high places, the exploring is mostly pleasant. It's odd that your heroine has to face challenges every time she tries to reach higher spots. Imagine a set of stairs; if you take each step in order, you can climb a hill; if you try to skip a step, you'll run into a wall. This is the simplest approach to illustrate the issue.  

Everything conforms to the traditional JRPG structure. This entails fighting in random and turn-based battles, purchasing and equipping new gear, using items, etc. The use of skills is the slightly different mechanic. These operate on points that carry over to subsequent battles and gradually recharge after each turn. 

Even though you control only three fighters at a time, your party can have up to six characters who can step in to take the place of the active fighter when their turn comes. Although it may seem like you'll have an easier time, a character's death throws everything out of the window. Because a healthy character won't automatically take its position after being knocked down and because you can't switch it until you bring it back from the dead, the problem is that a downed character is practically a dead weight. An extremely odd and senseless design decision. 

Another weird decision is the inclusion of difficulty settings. This should be removed. While playing on easy level makes sense if you want to focus on the story, playing on hard makes the game absolutely unplayable because of unbalanced encounters. You’re constantly walking back to your bed to heal after every battle or wasting revive items on companions who are killed in one hit.

But what I really found interesting is the mechanic where you fill out information about enemies. Each enemy begins with a card that is entirely blank and has only question marks. From health and experience points to status effects and drops, this card has it all.

Information can be obtained in a variety of ways. You have three options: utilize a scan magic, defeat the enemy, or hit it with various weapons, which is the least useful approach because you don't always have everything in your arsenal. If you keep fighting, you will eventually obtain all of the data since at least one piece of information will be filled out each time you scan or eliminate an enemy. The perk of collecting info is that you can skip a fight.",1.0

Almost every stealth game I play teaches me something new about the whole stealth genre, tells me a unique story about its creation and aims of its developers. This game is no exception, stealth here feels unique, smooth and rough at the same time. It feels like it offers similar options as other stealth games, but in some aspects it's much more diverse, and the one mechanic that separates it from literally anything else is the fact that you are as blind ad your enemies. It is similar to submarine simulators in that regard, but here it's much easier to sink in this mechanic. Feels refreshing to be somewhat on par with your rivals.

3545,136880503.0,1611960,"Doomed Lands is a top-down pixel art survival game where the player is transported to a post-apocalyptic environment where the world is dominated by horrible and mutant creatures. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible while facing these threats, collecting resources, and fighting for your life.

One of the highlights of Doomed Lands is its atmosphere. The pixel art graphics, with a dark and somber color scheme, add a sense of despair and constant danger. The soundtrack also contributes to this atmosphere, with ambient sounds that bring the game world to life and add tension to the most dangerous moments.

The gameplay of Doomed Lands is challenging, with limited resources and threats around every corner. The player needs to manage their hunger, thirst, and energy, as well as dealing with hostile monsters and other dangers that arise as they progress through the game world. There is also the possibility of encountering other survivors who may help or hinder the player, adding an extra layer of complexity and unpredictability to the game.

A negative point of Doomed Lands is the lack of variety in terms of enemies and resources. Although there are some different types of monsters and resources, overall, the game can become repetitive after a few hours of gameplay.

However, overall, Doomed Lands is a solid and well-executed top-down pixel art survival game. With its dark atmosphere and challenging gameplay, it offers an immersive and engaging gaming experience for players seeking an intense challenge.",1.0
3546,136880531.0,2368510,"A great little indie arcade gem for a really low price. 

Though the developer has released titles on other platforms in the past, Soulvester VS Lil' Beezey is the first Steam release from developer Chaz Carter and it's a fantastic debut.

The voice acting by Dicky Carter is perfect and gives me the same fun vibe as titles like BattleBlock Theater. The gameplay is fast and responsive, the sound effects are satisfying and everything about it oozes charm - it had me grinning from ear to ear as I finished my first run. 

There's still room for improvement: the game is extremely short and replay value is limited (outside of posting high scores), but it's still a bargain at the current price and this could easily be fixed in a future update by adding some form of meta progression, like adding more upgrades to the pool as you unlock achievements.

The music in Energy Survivors is absolutely captivating. The soundtrack features a perfect blend of futuristic electronic beats, intense battle themes, and haunting melodies that perfectly complement the game's sci-fi setting. The music dynamically shifts based on the in-game situations, creating a seamless and immersive experience. I found myself getting lost in the game's world, thanks in part to the engaging and atmospheric soundtrack that kept me hooked from start to finish.

In addition to the outstanding music, the overall game feel in Energy Survivors is exceptional. The controls are smooth and responsive, allowing for precise aiming and movement, which is crucial in a third-person shooter game. The animations are fluid, and the graphics are visually stunning, creating a visually appealing and immersive world to explore. The roguelite mechanics add an element of replayability, as each run presents new challenges and opportunities for experimentation with different upgrades.

I also appreciated the variety of upgrades available in the game, which allowed me to create unique and powerful builds to suit my playstyle. Experimenting with different combinations of upgrades was not only fun but also strategic, as I had to carefully choose my upgrades to adapt to the challenges of the hostile planet I was exploring.

Overall, Energy Survivors left a lasting impression on me with its incredible music and game feel. The captivating soundtrack and immersive gameplay made for an unforgettable gaming experience.

3560,136887294.0,2372750,"I thought the game was just okay, not much content though, it only has 4 stages and +2 bonus levels, so about 60 minutes on normal difficulty. Also, I had a few small problems with the clipping on the hitbox, for example whenever you have to dash between any spikes, sometimes it's a bit tricky to avoid the walls. I think one area took me about 10 tries, and in general, I feel like the dev went a little crazy on the enemy spam. That said, you can lower the difficulty which will negate the HP problems, but the game is still has a few weird platforming sections.

One thing I would recommend is to have at least 2 areas per biome, most devs would stretch the themes for a couple of stages, but you only had 1 or 2 areas for the same visuals; If you already created enough assets to make the level look unique, you might as well make it last for more than 10 minutes. A few other small nitpicks I have, some of the thorns had a very similar color to the ground, might want to make it a bit darker, and I was a bit confused by the damage, some enemies seem to do 1 damage, and others are doing 2 or 3?

Other than that, I thought the levels and the cutscenes looked decent, with a few cute moments in the narrative. 

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

(+) Well, the game is mostly average in every aspect, aside from a few polish issues, it plays decently, it looks okay, music is nice (not sure if made for the game), and it has a few funny scenes.

[h1] Feedback: [/h1]

[u] Content [/u] - you have enough variety between the stages, but I felt like you didn't make enough actual platforming between the zones, like you have stages that look nice, but only 1 area per theme. Usually, devs will make 3 or 4 areas per zone, so you could use what you already have and just make more platforming content. Even one of the bonus stages looks like a dungeon, but you didn't really use those tiles much. 

[u] Gameplay [/u] - the thorns need a bit of color coding. I had some issues with the tight spots between the spikes, easy to clip the hitbox, maybe make those areas a bit wider so you not hitting the ceiling all the time. The platforming momentum felt just slightly off to me, I think he falls down just slightly too fast, and the base walking speed without running probably should be a bit higher. 

[b] Overall Thoughts: 6/10 [/b]

The biggest thing for me, like I said, you have different themes, but only 1 area per location for the most part, usually it's 3 or 4 right, you don't even need to make more assets, just use those that you already have to make more content.I felt like the level design was a bit crowded in terms of hazards, even though the game plays decently it's very easy to feel like something is unfair. The game is technically not bad, it just feels like you didn't fully optimize the stages so there are some small moments that can be frustrating. I think you need to make the movement a bit more gradual in the mid-air.

You can view my initial impressions review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/9S853VgxaAY

One of the best, if not the best, free to play VR music rhythm games on Steam. It's really just a notch or two below Audio Trip or Synth Riders. It's got a pretty good soundtrack from Yandex Music that I was actually digging.

It looks nice. The gameplay is solid (just not as good as Synth Riders or Audio Trip). The visuals look really good for a free to play title. The music is pretty good. You get a very good workout as well. 

Game is running on the Unity Engine. On my RTX 3080, I was getting mostly 90 fps, with just some drops here and there that did not effect gameplay. You can play seated or standing (game is much easier playing seated). Beware though: even on easy, this is quite the workout. You'll have to do some squats to reach the orbs when they are placed low. That's the main reason why I had to tap out after 30 minutes (I'm out of shape though).

[b]Rate 8/10. Not sure why it's free, but I'll take it.[/b]

Having to navigate and consider your facing orientation helps give this a more challenging edge than it's peers in terms of action, and it's fun just running around bashing some of the little enemy units. Still feels like I'm early into it, but I'm hoping to see some more weaponry and tactics that use the strafe vs random targeting since that's a key feature that makes it feel unique.

The format gives you more tangible goals too (reach wave 15) vs. open ended survive as long as possible which I appreciate. Animations are solid, you can tell a lot of work was done to not only get a lot of enemies on screen but also give you plenty of nice destruction effects going on.

Some criticisms I would give to the game:
-The music is fine but the sound effects are a bit too ""sharp"" and it kinda hurts the ears after a while.
-There was no way to refer to the controls after the initial level. It would be nice to have a controls list in the pause menu.
-Trying to line up the mech using the Spacebar was also a bit frustrating as you're weaving around enemies and running straight eventually leads to running into a big crowd.
-The lack of control over the mech itself. I feel like this game is designed more for mobile in mind, so maybe that's the point, but I was really hoping to pilot the mech and have some control over the actions I performed other than WASD. Maybe have an option to automate/manually control certain actions, as well as be able to make the mech spin using the mouse (or using the arrow keys?) independently from movement. This also made it particularly frustrating when trying to fight the bosses, as I couldn't put my focus on any specific type of enemy.

It starts pretty slow and you think is this it? But the actual beauty of this game is the calmnes of it all.
It's actually one of the most relaxing games I've played in a long time.

The minigames sprinkled in between are great and super intuitive even when played with a controller. The world gets prettier and prettier the longer you play and eventually you realize what you would have in your own life if you just looked a bit more closely.

Considering almost everything is made by just one person I would say you definetly should pick it up and give it a go!

First, the game developer is very lazy. Below is how he or she solves tech issue. 

EA 1.01 bug fix

.....Quote: Important: for those bug to work, please delete the following file in your computer\Users\user name\AppData\LocalLow\senmu\Three kingdom game. Unquote

First not everyone is technical enough to find this file. Second this is not the right way to solve tech issue in a game. I will not recommend people to buy at this moment.

Second, the general cards are very weak in design, either over point or the growth over time is not really worth it. Just need to get a weapon and armor option is better than any general cards.
Take example: Guan Yu, 3 point to use...+1 permenant attack to HIS card only when he killed a enemy. But there are many cards that increase OVERALL attack which cost lesser points. By the 10 rounds, it is useless as there are many cards option. In fact, Guan Yu card is a handicap to your deck LMAO in the start. You don't need to overkill the enemy. Same apply to Zhan Fei, useless card. These 2 cards needs to be redesign.",0.0

3624,136909029.0,1851030,"Okay so first off I'll lead this review by saying that it is a good game, the charting is excellent and it's insanely fun to play for what it is. However there are two glaring issues, one has a work around, one doesn't. The horizontal note lane is fucking atrocious for reading notes, especially if you come from any other rhythm game ever made. There's a reason with Taiko no Tatsujin and Muse Dash limit the game to just two note types, because horizontally the notes become overwhelming to read. This can be fixed by flipping your monitor into portrait mode through Windows however, though you're stuck with mirrored notes if you need downscroll. The second issue is that the health bar is just too far away from the rest of the information, this is a rhythm game so your eyes are glued to a certain part of the screen at all times, and they designed the ultra and EX meters well enough with this in mind, however, the health is on the complete opposite end of the screen making it pretty much a no go to look at unless you're on a simple part of the song and your opponent isn't completely ruining you with garbage. It's a fun game but it needs some sort of UI customization, which is something that many people were asking for in the discussions and it seemed like the creators of this game refused to listen to them. As is I can't fully recommend this game since you have to physically flip your screen or with a setting to be able to play it well.",0.0

3634,136911964.0,2317560,"Brief comment of producer Yang Zhongping

As a gamer playing this game since 2022, I feel like it’s necessary to introduce our dear official to fellow gamers.

1, producer Yang the fatty has worked in several companies, like ByteDance and Xindong. Eventually he joined Mihoyo’s dev team and scammed more than 100 million RMB (about 15million USD) with only 20 men and within 2 years. These money are all for his own purpose, like larger apartments and cars in Shanghai. Although his project in Mihoyo was eventually killed, Liu Wei, the CEO of Mihoyo still allowed him to take all project-related resource for his own game. When the beta test of this game started, all Mr. Yang did is to reap gamers’ wallets. A typical banner is 10 rolls with 200 RMB, and only get a guarantee after 150 rolls. 

2, Yang takes a rough attitude towards players’ reporting, he would ban accounts which are innocent, simply because they were reported by their opponents. Whenever you feel like your opponent in this match is using game mechanics as an advantage or simply unhappy today, then report your opponent and you will never see him again. Yang also forces gamers to follow his rule and never listen to suggestions, even if himself doesn’t understand how his game works. Last but not least, Yang would release update patch during the critical moment of a match (a typical match usually lasts 2-3 days) and the server maintenance would last hours, resulting in players losing advantage.

3, as a producer of the game, Yang hacks every time he fight against real players. As an ordinary gamer, I’m lucky enough to meet this occasion once and witnessed him hacking during a live stream. When we are about to complain about this, Yang emphasized that he created the game and no one shall oppose him. He doesn’t care about players’ account and threatened to sell them. We have never received any apologies for this.

4, Yang has been avaricious, he only cares about money but not gamers. Adding in-game purchase in RTS??? I’m sure EN players would meet “unlimited corner turret” and more unreasonable things in the future. He also added in-game ADs as a bonus, which is simply because his Taobao account was reported and he needs another way to reap gamers. Now he has a EN server, and in-game purchase would be activated again to take money from your wallets, legally. 

5, recently the price for a vehicle banner has raised from 10 rolls a guarantee to 40 rolls a guarantee, forcing gamers to pay much more money to obtain full game experience. Unlike other gacha games, players who refuse to pay abundant money in this game have very little game experience.

6, Yang was also found in Wechat selling players’ accounts which have been permanently banned by him. As stated before, Yang takes an arbitrary attitude in banning accounts, and these accounts which have abundant resources along with full arsenal are sold at a much lower price. In summary, players are viewed as four-leg livestock, awaiting to be reaped randomly.

From close test to beta test, this game has already witnessed a great loss of population in merely several months. Strongly suggest whoever still playing this game not to pay, and if possible, not to play. There are better games in Steam, and there’s no need to stick to this piece of shit. Just let Yang the fatty being the dictator, since there are only two guys left in his dev and he personal attacked his own customer service. The game is failing, and no need to go down with this sinking ship.",0.0

And after reading on the store page that leveling was different, I figured I would try it out.
The ""world""/dungeon is comprised of narrow tunnels connected to small - big rooms, that have enemies potions etc in them.
But enemies are stationary and will not move in any way, and to attack them you move into them until your hp is low, then you take a potion and continue bumping into them. When enough of the same enemy have been killed you get a stat based on that enemy.

1. 50% discount on table already owned in Pinball FX 3... I can understand that they have to rework some of these tables, but having to buy everything again!!!.  Discount could have higher (like at 75% - 90% discount).  I only bought a few tables I already owned.
2. Still missing some old tables (I would really like to see the ""Street Fighter"" table and ""Ms Splosion Man"" table that was made years ago)
3. New ball physics on old zen table takes time to get used to (especially if switching between FX and FX 3)
4. Some server connexion problems

In short, I like it, but I will probably only buy the new tables.  The one I already have, I will play on FX3 (or FX 2)",1.0

[u]I understand the controversy behind this release.[/u]

Business model aside, this [i]is[/i] the better way to play. The tables feel much better. As much as I loved FX3, the physics were all over the place and some tables felt very slow and floaty. Others felt like you were playing with a marble rather than a heavy steel pinball. This release addresses all of these issues and makes each tables physics feel unified. Obviously there are some tables that feel faster in pace, but it feels that way now because of the table design rather than the wacky physics. Some tables have become easier, some have become much harder because of this change. And I like this! 

If you can deal with the fact that you'll have to rebuy any tables you previously owned on FX3 (albeit at a discounted price now!) and that some of the new releases come with a premium price tag, you're in for a real treat. Personally, I play a stupid amount of pinball, so the thought of spending £7-£10 on a single table seems like a deal to me. I'd be spending well over £10-£30 playing real physical tables, so to buy and keep some of my favourite real tables for under a tenner is great. I understand that to some this is unacceptable, [i]but this it MILES[/i] better than that god awful ticketing system we had on the epic store.",1.0

I have never seen a shooter with such deliberate mechanics that emphasize gunplay. It takes advantage of the space theme to innovate and improve on the COD formula. Unlike COD, camping is not strong because the game always warns you of enemy presence. Furthermore, tagging enemies temporarily mark them on your minimap, allowing you to ensure your kill. Grenade spam is not encouraged because of the delayed weapon switch and slow rate of usage, ensuring that such utility is used deliberately instead of liberally for lucky kills. These features also serve to prevent complete curb stomping in lobbies by few players because it forces them to temporarily retreat before reengaging. Combined with the ability to turn any ""low ground"" to ""high ground"", the game provides the player all the tools necessary to engage the enemy on their terms, only being limited by the player's creativity. I firmly believe that the reviews that criticize this game for it's ""lack of replayability"" or the ""lack of progression"" are largely unfound. The player movement allows you to manipulate the map, breaking conventional ideas of positioning and engagement. Every match can be a new way to explore the same map as opposed to a static environment. The game also simplifies unlocking attachments and cosmetics to getting kills with a character with a gun. No need to get 50 kills mounted to a wall or getting 5 kills with a character. Playing the game to unlock all items in the game is a weird feature to criticize especially for a price less than $30 USD.  The failure of this game to survive makes it very clear to people only want the same big esport tactical shooters or battle royales with long battle passes again and again.

The two complaints I do have do not take away from the overall experience but things I hope are ironed out by the time early access ends. The first feature needed is the ability to customize the HUD or make the HUD like other fps. Having the radar not on the top left and the weapons on the right is jarring to see. The second complaint is for the inclusion of louder music. I could play my own music in the background but it would be nice to have atmospheric jazz or classical music picked by the devs playing.

Props need improvement. Some guns exposing the players from hiding out. The station should not stayed stationary, it easier to spot the player because player is the only subject that is moving.

The game is very face-paced, too fast for my liking, but it does compromised with the speed of changing gears, reload and the cooldown time of your gadgets.

Many a time I have tried so hard to go down the Non-pay route (Sure it takes a lot of time to progress) to see if it can be done and with some games this can be achieved, Eternium being one of them as an example, but this game makes it near on impossible with what can be viewed as hours and hours of grinding just to complete one part of a task (if trying the non-paying style of play). And with the addition of an energy system that depending on what you do determines how quickly it drains. Completing tasks become very laborious, very quickly.

This is a game that is designed to be played by somebody on their phone whilst on a break from work or waiting for a bus. Log on complete one task, log off. It is not designed to be continuously played on PC.

So, I looked up the devs for this game and although it is their first game that they have made and released (from what I could see anyway) what they have created had the potential to be very good but I feel the way they have executed it, is a slight 'dropped the ball' moment, especially with the energy system which is generally viewed in a heavily negative light.

The game is only about 10 hours long but has some extra content to unlock if you're a real masochist.

My most frustrating gripe is a lack of a map. The game has the Soulsborne approach to progression and exploration where you only get a general hint about where to go but then you're on your own. This would be fine but the game doesn't have enough visual cues in some dungeons to direct you toward the goal and you can totally miss that one door you need to walk through if you just didn't happen to scroll the screen far enough in the right direction.

The story of Hunt the Night is fairly light, limited to a handful of conversations. However the true depth is in the environmental storytelling present in notes and destruction throughout the world. In addition, the backstory is set up through a world concept of infusing feathers with memories. These provide a lot of detail. And there are about 30 of them in all.

The sound in the game is excellent. The combat sound effects feel appropriate and provide lots of feedback. And the soundtrack is very fitting for the atmosphere of the different biomes present in the game.

The gameplay loop of Hunt the Night is quite fun. You generally solve a few puzzles on the way to the boss room in the five dungeons. The puzzles break up the combat nicely and they are not too difficult. You’ll end up facing 10 main quest bosses and optionally 10 hunt mini bosses, which are supped up versions of normal enemies. As for the enemies themselves there are 17 types that I could count. Every boss encounter was a challenge except for 2 of them. And even the hunt mini bosses were a challenge at times due to the mobs that would also get thrown at you. The 5 dungeons are connected by the overworld which contains a few side quests, lots of hidden items to collect, and some of the mini bosses.

Unlike the aforementioned games where if you are killed in game and lose your (souls etc. whatever currency) HTN does not do that. You keep what you kill. Another big plus is save points are right where you need them just before a boss. The music is good, the art is SUPERB. The combat is quick paced. The story is so-so. The lore is excellent. Creepiness and jump factor is definitely in high in there. 

The few janky or bad things about the game are quite minor. From using healing items and spell use if you get hit you can get cancelled (normal in many other games). HTN can use more spells and weapons. I found the layout of your home base of Ravenford  a bit strange with the merchant a bit out of the way.

But what about getting started?  So for a game created by just two guys, I'm STUNNED at how well done it is and this is brought across early when, aside from adopting standard controls, getting them communicated is so well done.  

So let's talk about gameplay.  Like many city builders, you know you're going to need resources, housing, farming, etc...and this is all present in Fabledom, but you also must maintain relationships with other kingdoms.  I have found there might be a balance or AI issue in that I am not getting enough focus on the most critical needs (wood, stone, building), and to that end it would be nice to see a few QOL changes like letting us know how each day is passing.  We don't get a clue as to if we're in Hour 1 or Hour 20 of any day.  And if you're waiting for taxes to arrive, that makes it difficult.

Another QOL would be I'd like to know if someone left or died.  I've seen my kingdom go from a max population to missing several citizens with no word to me that they're gone or why.  But hey, its Early Access.  All of this is to be expected.

3693,136894845.0,1183800,"Take the modern X-COM games and Darkest Dungeon and mix them together in a pot. Next, boil it down quite shallowly to reduce it to the basics and evaporate any depth. What you get is this game. And a soup you will enjoy. Once. Or maybe half of once.

The mechanics are mostly sound, 
the gameplay is satisfying (for a bit), 
and it's reasonably difficult (at first). 
Good. 
But...
The only difficult part of the game is the start (once you upgrade stuff the difficulty drops off dramatically), 
the characters are way unbalanced (2 of the initial party can essentially carry a team, whereas other characters are super nuanced and difficult to strategize in general terms), 
most upgrade choices are obvious, 
unlocks become increasingly specific (they basically tie specific achievement-style accomplishments to unlocking stuff, which is problematic), 
and you will have seen basically everything this game has to offer in your first play-through (which is a problem for a procedurally-generated game). 
Also, the Darkest Dungeon-style hub stuff is incredibly shallow and you will just do the same stuff over and over, while the PTSD stuff is just ""don't let it happen"", because there's no mitigation of bad traits or, so far as I can tell, good traits you can get (in my first play my overwatch sniper got stressed out by being near my auto-reload bot due to a malus, which really messed with my main strategy, and there was nothing I could do about it beyond eventuallyt increasing the bot's range and hoping there was cover further out, or just eating the stress of them being next to each other). You just don't want it to occur. At best it will be a mixed blessing.
And the game just goes on too long for the content available. 
Bad.

There is ostensibly replay value with unlocking characters and such, but I had grown tired of the formula by about 1/2 to 2/3rds of the way through my first game, so that's a bit of a waste.

The game is probably a 5/10. It's fine. Even fun for a while. But there's nothing to keep you interested for long. 15$ is the price, and that's probably about right. I finished my first playthrough in... 7 hours? Then I messed around for another few trying other characters and stuff, but given the lack of character balance I just wanted my original multi-kill melee and multi-kill sniper back, and given the lack of  variety, I really didn't want to just go through the incredibly basic loop again for many hours. 
The game has excellent bones, but it's basically a skeleton. There is almost no meat, and the meat it does have is just one meaty meal and then soup for the rest of the week.
If a playthrough took 2-3 hours instead of 7-8, and they added some mission variance beyond the 2 set pieces and the one optional and occasional ""blow up a thing"" category it could be quite good. The game basically needs more in less time. Halfway through the first play you'll have seen everything, but not have experienced any of the character or bot variations. By the end you might not want to start over because it's just the same fights and run to the door missions over and over and over. The camp phase is also basically just rote ""this is the obvious thing"" which later turns into ""these are the only useful things"". 


Also, just a personal thing - I find the use of ""punk"" as a suffix for made-up genres or non-genres lazy and irritating. The cyberpunk genre had that title for a reason - high tech, low life. It was named that because it evoked the punk ethos of the 70s. Just calling a thing ""blank-punk"" doesn't mean anything, and it bothers me that lazy people have just started genre-ing or specific-titling things ""blank-punk"" as shorthand for ""level or source of technology.... .. .. .. . .... . punk"". 
Also also, Verminfall is basically just ""so you know that game Vermintide? How can we steal that idea without anyone calling us out on directly yoinking it?"". Maybe try even a little?
Also also also, beyond the initial two problems I have with the title of this game, I have a third one. Why does seemingly every game these days have to have a sub-title? Either of the two words of this game's title are sufficient for a title. It doesn't need both.
I don't know if any of that last personal complainy bit is actually relevant, but I do think it reveals to some degree the effort put into this game. It's fairly by the numbers, doesn't do anything particularly interesting, and takes some clear shortcuts that send the mechanics out of the deep end and into the kiddy pool. It's fine, and probably worth playing once, but you're not going to be telling your friends to go out and get it, or returning to it in a couple months or years. It's a middle-of-the-road game that might entertain you by being something new, but you can play either of the games it apes for dozens of hours and be consistently challenged, satisfied, and messing around with nuances of strategy. You'll be lucky to get 10 solidly engaging hours of this game.

Honestly, it's a coin-flip on recommending this game. My actual review is ""5/10, average, neutral"" If it cost any more than it does I would definitely tell people not to buy it. As it stands, though, my basic take-away is ""if you've got 15$ to spare buy it knowing you'll play it once over a day or two. If that sentence bothers you save your money for a more replayable game"".",0.0

If I had one complaint it is that some characters feel like they don't pull as much weight as others. I just finished a play-through with the fencer and by the end he felt like he would get a few one off kills, and his main help to the team was with his bunker skill. Now why is this a complaint? Characters like Tilly and Gideon scale so quickly after a few upgrades and skills they can solo clear most waves on their own. Then you have characters who feel just right like Silas that is strong, but not so crazy as his skills limit him with Stress so it's a fun game of ""do I use them now? Or will I need him to have extra AP later in the mission?""

Overall a very fun find, and a big steal for the price (especially with the launch sale). I plan to try a hard run with other characters to see how it goes.",1.0

Other than that this game was a blast had great fun killing spiders and finding new weapons and even ones i hadn't seen in the non-vr and i only notice the massive spider on the roof on the second to last mission in my first run through ive never been more disturbed i little think that i would love to see if the devs are going to update it more i would love to see some weapons have the ability to hold with two hands i thought that would have been cool.

3706,136892442.0,1567000,"ILL WILL is a great throw back game :) 

Ill will doesn't break any new ground or anything it does the old school retro fps the correct way. 
1) Awesome level design - Levels that are not only cool to look at but are fun to explore and not once did i ever get lost or frustrated when playing them. 
2) Enemies and their variety - Enemies in any video game have to balanced and fun to kill and the ones in ILL will are just that. Sure most people will recognise these enemies are homages to the ones you've seen in doom and tons of other fps. But these work just like the enemies in doom offering a brutal yet fun challenge 
3) Weapon Roster - shotguns, fish launcher, laser beam gun, rocket launcher, weapon no7 which i call the headache gun lol super shotgun assault rilfe etc. yeah all standard but still very fun to use and each weapon is never useless they all serve a particular purpose for a specific enemy which is very cool 
4) Game Length - Hard skill took me just over 4hrs not bad but ive played so many fps games and for $30 aussie dollars thats not bad
5) The music = omg the best part of the game the soundtrack is amazing and each level has its own theme and music that blend so well together. The game alone is worth it to hear the music. 

Conclusion: Thats about it really ILL WILL is a cool old school throw back shooter that uses unreal 4 to make everyone look like quake 3 well thats the vibes i got. Its a blend of doom, quake and serious sam with a crazy feeling added to the mix you will know what i mean when the play the later levels :) 

I recommend this game to any fps fan :)",1.0

The level design is impeccable, the atmosphere oozes character, and if I could summarize crudely, if Tim Burton smoked a bunch of crack, and decided to develop a FPS, illwill is what that game would look like.

The game’s premise is simple, run, double jump, and shoot. You get an assortment of weapons, including everyone’s favorite, the double barrel shotgun.

If you use the leech gun, the enemies will drop the leeches, which you can consume and regain your health or, if you time it right, you can get to max health which is at 200%.

3715,136918008.0,"1798010,1798020","It is both very easy and very hard to recommend this game (as well as Vol. 2)

These games are my childhood, and while I didn't realize they were proper deck builder games as a child, I now consider them possibly the best deck building games from the GBA/DS (and that's while I had also played Yugioh & Duel Master games on it, which were often also great).

These are great deck builder games for their time, and still decent today. You've likely never seen any other games with this formula of Action Shooter + Deckbuilder, unless you've played ""One Step from Eden"" which heavily draws inspiration from this series (as well as the roguelite elements from Slay the Spire).

So why do I find it so hard to recommend:

Denuvo. 

As someone who has played them on the original system, and is now playing them on a much better system, I can tell you that it's far less responsive then I remember, and all I can think of is that Denuvo is delaying player input due to the active encrypting and decrypting of data as it's needed. So either Denuvo is screwing my input timing and causing it to feel like I'm Anchored with chips that didn't used to feel that way in the past, or they did a terrible job of porting the game.

What baffles me, is why they felt the need to put Denuvo on a rerelease of a series that has all the emulator ROMs still out in the wild... I don't condone piracy, but these games have long since been lost to the seven seas, so why even bother having an anti-piracy program that's basically a rootkit on it?

I hope they remove it, and I avoided pre-ordering this series because of it, but the chance to relive my childhood was too strong of a pull, and I caved.

Remove Denuvo, and this game becomes perfect, or at least reveals the need of updates to fix errors in porting it.

Denuvo might ""claim"" that their product doesn't put strain on processing/slow down the program, but that can only be a lie. You basically kill off hyperthreading if you can't queue up the next bit of data because it has to be decrypted still, which by itself is enough to create a noticable slowdown.

9/10 for the whole series... 0/10 for Denuvo as a program. It actually manages to slow down a GBA era game, on a Ryzen 3600 + RX 6600 + 32GB DDR4 RAM. Heck, wasn't the GBA single core?",1.0

You start each dungeon at level 1, and the goal is to power up enough to kill the boss. But you have limited resources. You only heal by exploring unexplored tiles or leveling up (or chugging potions), and you only level up by killing things (which usually depletes health and/or mana). And monsters and items don't respawn or anything like that. So you have to be smart about how you go about killing things, and in what order, and so on.

You can also unlock new classes and starter items and such to take into the various dungeons, and there are special challenge dungeons, and some tightly calibrated puzzle levels. It's pretty engaging overall. Made me late to class because I lost track of time.

Also the music in the dungeons is pretty great. 

And the tutorial system is extremely well done. It throws you right into a dungeon that's designed to teach you how to play as you go, without any explicit instructions.

Anyway, the second video (with the gnome wizard runthrough) does a decent job of showcasing game mechanics. Your goal is to explore a randomly-generated dungeon and ultimately to defeat a high-level boss monster. To beat the boss, you'll need to have leveled efficiently. This (usually) includes killing the highest-level monster that you can at any given time, since you get bonus XP for killing a monster whose level is higher than your own. 

That's pretty much the core of what makes Desktop Dungeons interesting: you're always trying to beat a tougher monster. The way you do this varies tremendously; there's a long list of things that can help or hurt you, and you have to deal with whichever ones happen to be in the dungeon you're exploring. It's this variation that keeps the game interesting hours later.

Bottom line: I don't often write reviews. I like Desktop Dungeons enough that I felt I should take the time. I highly recommend this game.",1.0

It also offers the possibility to just do a quick game and play one dungeon at a time, but can suck you as easily in and you can waste some hours with the ""just the next quest"" addiction.

I also really liked the mixture of strategy and luck, which makes this game unpredictable as well as mentally challenging. The puzzle levels which are also more or less randomly generated set very strategic stages, which you can spend easily a few hours on to crack one. The humour offered in this game is also a great comic relief.

3796,136911891.0,1681060,"[h1] EXOGATE INITIATIVE – Not Recommended... Yet | Early Access Review [/h1] 

[b] Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mazkYe-exWc [/b] 

Exogate Initiative is a fun if occasionally frustrating management/base-building hybrid that gives you control of an international for-profit space exploration operation that’s tasked with exploring and exploiting the universe via instant-transmission portals called (you guessed it!) exogates.  

Now, of all the sims I’ve ever sim’d, Exogate Initiative is... certainly one of them. That's not to say this game is bad—far from it, in fact, as I mostly enjoyed my ten+ hour dive into this title’s Early Access offerings. However, as of recording and as you’d expect of any Early Access release, Exogate Initiative currently lacks a good bit of polish, balance, and an “x-factor” that would make it worth the time of folks that aren’t already fans of the genre. But! If you, like me, enjoy sci-fi and simulators, then stick around, because Exogate Initiative hits most of the highs of the genre (and a few of the lows). 

You’ll begin your operation by excavating a large underground area using a fleet of autonomous robot slaves I mean workers, and I never grew tired of listening to their playful little beeps and chirps (which, in hindsight, might have been them crying out for liberation). Assuming you picked “Initiation” mode instead of “Freeplay,” you’ll then begin working through a long list of objectives delegated to you by the ever mysterious, always greedy, and probably nefarious Committee. These objectives slowly introduce you to each of Exogate Initiative’s classes or “Gaters” from scientist to soldier to scholar, and you’ll need to run recruitment campaigns, shuffle through applications, select the least shi*ty candidates, and then assemble teams before sending those suckers through the exogate, all in the name of profit! 

Each exoplanet you discover and assemble into your power-hungry grid of universal domination presents its own set of risks and rewards, from environmental hazards to alien artifacts to rare metals to outright hostile alien @ssholes called SQARBS who will occasionally invade your base, knock out your worthless soldiers, blow up a handful of generators, and peace the f**k out. And if you can’t tell, yes, I hate sqarbs.  

During missions, your teams will occasionally radio you with short, choose-your-own adventures that require selecting from a handful of (usually) easy-to-choose options. This feature can be disabled, but I found these interactions to be pleasant if forgettable interludes from the otherwise crushing weight of team composition micromanagement that Exogate Initiative often forces upon you. That’s right, despite automating much of the grunt work (like restocking vending machines and maintaining generators), Exogate still necessitates near constant vigilance, whether it’s monitoring when to sell rare metals on the marketplace, telling your scientists to write new patents, tending to your Gaters never-ending physical and psychological needs, and starting new missions. 

At its best, this gameplay loop is satisfying and addictive. At its worst, you can find yourself stuck in a horrifying downward spiral of injuries that require medical attention, but your medics hate working and when they do they become depressed, thereby necessitating the hiring of new medics to cure the old ones until the new ones invent new ways to not work. And, because you can’t make anyone do anything in Exogate Initiative (i.e., you can’t click tell the depressed medic to go get his own happy pills), you’re pretty much at the mercy of the semi-shitty AI to right this sinking ship. This injury spiral can make it impossible to field healthy teams for new missions which are required to fund your initiative, meaning you might get stuck in budget hell like I did and have to reload saves from an hour ago to figure out where things went wrong. It’s by no means broken, but Exogate Initiative will need significant balancing between now and full release if it’s to become a title worth recommending. Oh, and while the devs are at it, a little polish on these often janky, clipping-prone animations and perhaps a complete overhaul of the hilariously bad Gater faces would be a nice touch. 

Until then, I’m giving Exogate Initiative a subject-to-change aggregate MEGA score of 2.91/5 (full scoring breakdown in video, from “Plot” to “Sound”), and I'll give a quick shoutout to the game’s calm yet curious synth score that does a nice job of building atmosphere.  

Thanks for reading!

I appreciate the warehouse management of pieces, paintings, glues, and tools as it adds another layer of strategy to the game.

Took a few missions to get used to combat, felt clunky at first until I realized that I need to stop mashing the buttons like I would if I were playing dead cells. Love the way you can switch out outlaws to get new combos, and the strategy of hopping back and forth to steal different spells to use them on other enemies that are weak to that element is really fun. Makes me play a bit more strategically, and it feels great to dart around and pull off sweet combos. The side characters are fun and well written. Not as story rich and intense as The Ruined King, but that's not a bad thing, just a different flavor. I really enjoy the world of Runeterra, but can't stand playing league anymore, so these other games in the same universe are always such a treat!

It's linear with some side quests, spawns seem pretty consistent. If you're looking for a rouge-lite you should go elsewhere, but this is still really fun all the same. Save screen says that after about an hour and a half on normal difficulty I'm 25% of the way through, so I'm predicting this will be shorter than I want it to. Bosses and enemies are designed really well though, so there's no tedious grind just to pad out the run time. I fully expect to be doing at least one more complete playthrough on hard mode once I beat this one.

Wish there was a way to upgrade from the standard edition to the deluxe rather than just buying each DLC individually. You don't interact with your hut much, so the cosmetics there are kinda meh. Spells look cool but there are a bunch of nifty ones in game so I'm not sure if it's worth the $6.

but it's pretty darn close

It's a base builder with science. But fear not, it's like someone took dungeon keeper or evil genius and combined it with stargate. Which is actually cool and a great idea.

Do you know how long i've wanted a stargate strategy game? The only problem here is it doesn't seem too focused on war or battles. Hopefully that changes. I know it's supposed to be science and exploration but the one thing I really wanted out of stargate was more war and battles. I don't want that to be the main focus. Keep it science and exploration. But it would be super cool if the devs added in some kind of simulated combat stuff with aliens. I mean they give you soldiers right? So why not give us a bit more. THis is the kinda feedback we need to give them.

But you're not here for that, you wanna know if this game is worth it? Is it worth it's asking price? Yes!

Does it have potential? Yes!

It's a really good fun game that's really well designed. And being in early access means it's only gonna get better. I just hope they don't raise the price beyond 25$. I feel like at most it's worth 30. Even when it's finished. But still the game's really fun and really well done so far and I hope they keep up the good work.

It looks pretty good, it feels pretty good, it's got amazing gameplay with lots of innovation (not gonna spoil what kinds) and overall it's a great starting point.

3928,66012238.0,1216320,"For me this wasn't something I enjoyed. Sure seeing little white blobs of pixels with Roman armor getting smashed and spewing colored balls of pixel blood seems like fun; but after running back and forth for 15-20 minutes trying to defend your flags and take flags from other pixelated armored blobs its gets super old.

I saw a video online and thought it would be a nice small game but its not what I was expecting; the game play is extremely repetitious and just doesn't fit with what I am looking for in a game. 

 [b] Views [/b] : When you are looking to play something like this the default view is extremely limiting and I found no options for getting out of the back of my commanders head and being able to see the field without coming down right over the top of his head with my mouse view. 

[b]Controls[/b]: Super simple and easy to get used to; this is probably the best part of the game by far. Not a whole lot to say other than that.

[b]Gameplay[/b]: If you are what I call a ""twitchy"" gamer that likes constant button clicks on your mouse then go ahead and spend the money. Otherwise its not worth it. I would not really call this a strategy game; even though there is a little bit of it in there. You get gold from taking flags and you get experience points from fighting but you are limited on the XP due to the flag that your standard bearer carries; but the XP you gain does stack up and helps you win battles or get gold quicker. The AI is extremely incompetent and they follow you nilly willy back into the range of your defending units on your fort and just get slaughtered when you turn around and attack with your troops because they are focused on your infantry and not saving themselves. The same can be said for your troops when you are attacking a fort. They have no code that allows them to loose confidence and retreat unless you tell them to. 

[b]Conclusion[/b]: In short don't spend your money unless you are just looking for something to add to the Steam collection that will let you spend 30 minutes running around like a pinball and spending the gold that you get from taking flags.",0.0

Besides that though. the game is fun with its use of strategic playtime on the enemies within said game,  especially when it comes to both attacking and defence. It makes you understand the power your troops can muster for an attack and takeover of an enemy base, and how many troops can you use to defend a position and move on to attack another enemy base. Personally I just love how can hold your mini army in the background to wait for the enemies to fight each other then swoop in and claim the flag.

My one suggestion is that more diverse units be added, with different strengths and weaknesses, to add a more tactical level to the combat. As it stands, the combat is just a mosh pit which, while fun for a while, gets very repetitive later into the missions. Adding units such as Triarii who may have more armor but do less damage, or Velites who would have less armor but more pilum, would go a long way towards making the combat more diverse and enjoyable.

3950,136918827.0,1183800,"about 1/2 way though first run, and it seems pretty good. as usual for these games, there seems to be some balance issues that manifest as you progress, where if you're doing well you can snowball, but if you're doing poorly you'll be unable to recover. this might not be so bad, but it feels like the runs are too long, and too unforgiving of single mistakes, with no undo or retry. that said i've been lucky in this run and didn't make too many mistakes, so i'm more on the snowball side right now. but every move on every level makes me worry i might get owned by some unpredictable mechanic i haven't seen yet or some random event.

maybe there's actually enough 'cushion' to prevent unfair-feeling game-overs, but since i haven't had to use them yet i'm not sure. i'm playing on normal+ (normal, but i didn't do the tutorial, since i did it in demo, which it turns out makes you miss out on some achievements/unlocks). it felt balanced for the first 5 or so missions, but now seems too easy.

my nit-pick list so far:
- missing out on achievements/unlocks if you skip tutorial, feels like a bug.
- can't see list of possible achievements in run?
- can't predict when/where reinforcements arrive, and it's a bit unclear what they can do on the 'arrival turn' (i think it's just a normal turn for them). in other games (e.g. into the breach), there's some kind of 1-turn warning or the like, and it's more predictable. i kinda got a 'feel' for when+where new rats would show up as i went, but i think it would be more fun if it was a bit more explicit (i.e. you 'hear warning noises' from one of the spawn edges and it's marked in flashing red or something).
- similarly, it's hard to predict where 'hidden' enemies are, at least initially. and it seems that a big part of being successful is triggering enemy groups, at the right time, from the right place. again, i got a feel for this as i went along, but i'm not sure the risk/reward/fun trade-off is exactly right. feels like it needs some kind of enemy-just-discovered mechanic/warning, and maybe a way to predict/preview what areas will be triggered/uncovered/newly-seen *before* committing to a move (i.e. like overwatch shows you a preview of the target-able squares).
- can't tell the ranges or types of enemies too clearly. i think it would be better to know the attack range (not just movement range) of enemies.
- even 15 missions in, i'm not sure i understand how range for my own guns works. is it different in overwatch? it's always 8 units? i just kinda guess and  it seems to usually be okay somehow.
- runs/missions both feel a bit too long to me.

anyway, despite the above issues it feels 'polished enough' for me to recommend, although it might be rough if you're not familiar with the genre. i'm not sure if i'll do a second run, at least not right away, but i'm getting enough out of one run to be content.",1.0

3963,136921404.0,1851030,"Ignore the low playtime; I spent a long time with the press demo before release and meant to get this out earlier. I purchased the full game to confirm criticisms were still applicable to the final product.

God of Rock is a visually frustrating game that fails to adequately represent either of the genres it's mashing together, but could easily be a mainstay in the genre if the UI was overhauled and the control scheme revisited.

For fighting game players thinking this could be a good addition to your local, you'll be disappointed by a lack of button binding at character select and the bindings themselves being confusing. On a traditional stick you're missing out on a second hand's worth of rhythm buttons, which are crucial for jacks in higher difficulty songs. On a leverless controller, you have to rebind your Dpad to joystick inputs - except the inputs are labelled, for some bizarre reason, as ""Up/Down"" and ""Up/Down (2)"". Which one is 'up'? Why are there two of these? Does it matter? Why can you bind two buttons for each of the directions? The obvious intended method of playing this is on a pad like a DS4, but those aren't always available - and I'll bet most people at locals don't want to switch to a regular controller just to play this.
The motion inputs are, speaking as a fighting game player, unnecessary for this game. I get the difficulty stems from pulling off 360s and QCFs while not dropping your rhythm combo, but it's just a needless layer of complexity. Pairing a non-rhythmic mechanical task with a rhythmic one is just... jarring. It's like typing a review with one hand and pulling off the TTFAF guitar solo with the other. I can't believe I'm saying this, but one-button specials would be tremendously helpful here.

The actual mechanics of fighting are simple enough; you have a health bar, and specials from yourself and your opponent will manipulate that health bar. Doing a higher level special move than your opponent at the same time they do will cancel theirs out, and this can chain up until the highest level, meaning you can't just mindlessly churn them out. Succeeding at the rhythm game gives you meter to perform these specials; the core loop is to score high combos, use the meter you build to go on the attack, and to make sure you're never starved for specials to counter their offense. Characters vary from the self-healing Hilda to the stance-focused Kosaku, and they're genuinely interesting. If this was a game that was easy to bring to locals and to get people set up, it'd be a fun side game.

While we're on that point, let's talk about the characters. The designs are fun! Many of the characters are obvious homages to rock legends, like Ziggy the Starman paying tribute to David Bowie's stage persona Ziggy Stardust or the obvious Elvis recreation King. Champ's just a buff shirtless Freddie Mercury and I'm extremely here for it. The cast is diverse, and hot-shot VAs like Kira Buckland (Hilde) and Jeff Williams (King) bring them to life. I genuinely want to see more of them! Edith's grayscale color palette is a nice bit of visual flair, and the God of Rock looks straight out of a guitar hero game. These characters would kick ass in a traditional fighting game, and there's already a nice foundation - heck, they even beat each other up on screen with each hit note. They're excellent, and easily one of the best parts of the game.
The game's visual flair is excellent, too, outside of the gameplay portions. I love the graffiti-esque stylings of the menus, the way portraits at character select look like they were spray-painted onto a wall. Song select is framed like you're picking out a single from an album. It wants an aesthetic, and it hits it. The game's a visual treat when you're not playing it.

Rhythm game players, I'm so sorry - it's a four-button horizontal-scroller. There's a reason most rhythm games are vertical scrollers, and that's to provide an easy analogue for which button is which note; notes fall onto your buttons. The vertical layout of the note icons/judgement line is confusing, and while it's learnable, it's annoying that there's no option to rotate it. I found myself craning my head 90 degrees to simulate a downscroll, and left my play sessions with neck pain. The chart itself takes up a tiny portion of the screen, and while most of the relevant information is clustered there - your special gauges and your EX meter, for instance - your health is for whatever reason all the way in the top corners. Having to dart your vision between the chart and the opposite side of the screen is disorienting, which makes it difficult to judge the state of the match. What's your life lead? Should you cash in and try to take out the last scrap of their health bar? The nature of rhythm games discourages you from looking away from the chart, but the HUD almost forces you to. This is especially pronounced when playing a character like Hilde, who self-heals; did your hard-earned 15 heal stacks actually just do anything? Drop your combo and find out, idiot.
The soundtrack is good, though. It won't be to everyone's tastes, but I like it. 'Embers' is a particular favorite.

Most of the screen seems to be dedicated toward showcasing the characters; they clash in the center as you and your opponent duke it out. The animation is good, the designs are good, but good god the VFX is overwhelming. If you're both doing well, then each blocked strike from the on-screen avatars sends out a blur and a flash of light. Consider that this means every hit note means there's a bright flash from off of the chart. Most rhythm games have some option or another to dim or disable non-chart elements for focus's sake, but God of Rock doesn't offer that. The visual flair for spectators seems to be prioritized over the experience of the players. Considering the giant wheel in the bottom-center of the screen showing what specials are being used, I can't imagine why it wouldn't be an option.
I experienced more than a few charts that weren't synced, but that could've been a calibration problem. YMMV.

God of Rock has a solid foundation. I really, really want this game to be good - we need more experimental games like this, and it knows what it's trying to do. I'm just not sure God of Rock knows how to do it. The team at Modus Games seems to really adore the project, so I'm 100% sure they'll bring it around within a year or so, but as-is on launch day I can't recommend it.",0.0

Desktop Dungeons still isn't exactly like that -- you can kill enemies with higher numbers given the right gear or skills, and enemies with lower numbers can kill you with the right special abilities (not to mention, there's a lot more going on here in terms of exploration and healing and mana management) -- but it's still a damned sight closer than all those fake games advertising number murder gameplay.

Engagements probably get a little boring after a while since it's always the same enemies, also because out of all the weapons available i only used 2 (tyrant that does 30 and shadow claws that deal 15) so i believe other weapons need some tweaks otherwise you're putting yourself at a disadvantage by using them (regular swords/claws do 10 damage which isn't enough to 1shot the small purple dudes, becoming VERY annoying while fighting Mother).

Another thing i didn't particularly like is the fact i had to wander for a soling 1 hour and a half after defeating the first boss because i had 0 idea where to go since they told me the places i had to head to but didn't know how to get there, so it felt like i was exploring parts of the map i wasn't supposed to be in.

Most darkness powers are useless besides 1 or 2, so giving a small tweak to those could probably help aswell (the game is very fast paced and having a 40 second cooldown on an ability when theres another that does the same job but has 12 seconds is nonsense).

Full Review and gameplay here: https://www.steamdeckgaming.net/post/disney-speedstorm-runs-great-on-steam-deck

The game might be capable of running on mobile devices, thanks to it being developed with Gameloft, but it takes full advantage of PC and Steam Deck graphics.

Sound Track rocks, the graphics are awesome and it's complete mayhem

On Steam Deck it works out of the box, both offline and online, with 50-60 FPS online multiplayer.
Although it is full of microtransactions, a free-to-play player is still going to have great fun, and even more so when they blow up a ""whale"" and take first place.",1.0

The game feels really good in general to play, i think it has a ton of potential. the music slaps so hard for what this game is, and overall it has been a fun kart racer and probably the best one we've ever gotten on PC 

however 

the free to play stuff is already pretty gross and it hasn't even started yet 
im talking like 6 currencies already all with suspiciously looking icons in what i imagine is an attempt to confuse the player. 

it forces you to pick your Free Racer Immediately before having any idea how they handle or abilities or anything of the sort i only drove as Micky for a Control tutorial before being forced to choose and if you try and back out of that menu it will automatically pick the first choice without any option to save it for later, them actually not even mentioning what kind of racer Micky is and then having you pick a class immediately one being identical to the starter, again kinda gross. 

then you have crew members to level up, team members to level, all with varying degrees of currency or items. the characters in party don't all work together so you have to pick them in theme to the overall character which for them literally being just an icon and no real modeled character seems a bit silly. this maybe their limiter on breaking the game with purchases and funds but i don't know that most of these should really be in here at all. 

for a minimum of $30 to start i don't think you really get a whole lot of anything and being forced to use the one item you get as soon as you get to the first menu is pretty upsetting, and i think you get the ""Golden Pass"" which i believe is the battle pass considering the bones here are really solid though the sense of speed could be better. which that may work itself out the higher you Level yourself or character.",1.0

4049,136925816.0,1976950,"Not a true review, but a big kudos to QCF for giving this sequel out to players of the original.  Super classy move, guys.  Big thank you!

As for the game, if you've played the OG Desktop Dungeons, you'll be extremely familiar with the mechanics of the game.  The graphics got a very obvious overhaul - for better or for worse - but the gameplay remains exactly the same, offering players new and old the same plate of tactical deliciousness that the original had.  If it bites you, you'll find yourself spending countless hours clicking away at this brain-teaser of a dungeon crawler.

But that doesn't tell you much, so let's just go over exactly what this is - it's a tile-based dungeon crawler that is made for bite-sized runs.  Play it for 20 minutes or for several hours at a time, the randomly-generated dungeons ensure there's plenty of replayability and the town building/upgrading will keep you diving for treasure.  Unlike other tile-based crawlers, instead of being an omniscient overseer of the map, you have an avatar and how/when you move/attack is vital to the way the game works. Exploring undiscovered tiles heals you and replenishes your mana, but every step you take away from an enemy you've damaged means they'll be healing (enemies never move, but ignoring them is usually temporary at best).  There are all sorts of spells and other ways to mitigate this to allow you to tactically run from a fight and return to it with less penalties, but dungeon crawling is a delicate balance of tactical decisions you'll need to make rather than being full-on risk/reward.

It looks like there are several new classes to play with along with a few new races (each combo giving you a different set of bonuses or abilities for your run) and though I've barely scratched at this, I'm sure the mind-bending puzzles also make a return.  The inventory system and the info panels also got a makeover - again, for better or for worse - and I haven't yet discovered all of the changes made here yet.  Though I do have to note that you can no longer long-click to access your glyphs which is a bit annoying.

At first blush, the game feels bigger somehow, but the change to a new engine makes it feel less like a desktop distraction (like the OG game or the old LucasArts Desktop Adventures games... member those?) and more like a fully-fledged game.  Not a big deal, but a lot of my time with the original was spent multitasking and you can always run this in a window for the same effect.  Either way, the dungeons seem to have a larger scope than before with more room to plan out your approach than before and plenty of opportunities for converting glyphs where the original felt super tight on that front.  Maybe it'll get tighter with more time under my belt.

At any rate, I'm pleased that the devs didn't try to reinvent the wheel here.  They expanded the original rather than modernizing it which is telling me they know exactly why people played the first game to begin with.  To me it feels like they're bringing it ten years into the future and not mucking with the formula.  ""Modern audiences"" can go somewhere else.",1.0
4050,136925161.0,1976950,"Pretty solid remaster of the Desktop Dungeons. There is some roughness in UI here and there by now, but core game mechanics are polished and balanced. The devs removed all the  'I'll wait until it is  done with autoexloring' thing of classic roguelikes, so no more grinding and searching for weaker enemies. You'll search for stronger enemies instead. The game leans more towards chess/puzzle side of the genre and it is a big fat plus.

I poured hours into the free beta in 2010, picked up the Enhanced Edition in 2013 (and mostly played on my tablet). I always wondered what QCF was up to after Enhanced came out and then I saw this pop up during one of the Steam Next fests. I was not expecting to get this for free, but if you owned the Desktop Dungeons Enhanced Edition before today, you should already have this in your Steam Library. 

I was extremely excited by the prospect of more Desktop Dungeons. I wasn't expecting that my original Enhanced Edition save would transfer over to the new game. That's some real dedication. 

Desktop Dungeons is one of the first coffee break/puzzle roguelikes I ever played. Its charming and simple art style hides a pretty nefarious and deep system once you start digging into it. I don't have the time to dig into the details right now (and honestly, it's more fun to figure out how to get some bonus XP by killing monsters that are higher level than you are on your own). The different class and character combinations can yield some really fun gameplay, but the real fun is when you start experimenting with worshipping different gods and finding out how to play to their strengths.

Desktop Dungeons Enhanced Edition is free on Steam if you want to check the game out for yourself. Rewind adds some quality of life changes and 3D graphics (among other things). If you like things like Golden Krone Hotel or Tactical Nexus, I bet you'll have a great time with Desktop Dungeons.",1.0

The game's essentially an Evil Genius light light light, with most management mechanics replaced in favour of spamming exploration missions. Unfortunately, the pacing forces you into simply mindlessly throwing your teams into the fray, Missions aren't very interesting, as there's no scouting or preparation or anything like that. They're essentially just click, spam, go. 

Sometimes a mission will result in a little vignette, but the writing in the ones I have  gotten to play so far (~30?) is bad to mediocre. The writers haven't really understood that just going ""ooooh mystery, eh? How about that?"" isn't really fun - it's just annoying. There's one larger plot with invading squids, which is also quite boring. A story needs to have a conclusion, come on!

The checks during missions are also somewhat opaque - it tells me the odds, but I don't really know what a failure does. Less XP?


It seems the game wants you to do a lot of team micromanaging, but the UI is actively hostile in making that happen. There's no team screen, you have to either create a team via the mission interface or via the HR screen. There's team compatibility, but you won't be shown this when making a team.

One major annoyance is teams simply not debarking. Often, this is due to teammates being in the hospital. You don't really get the luxury of having spares, but should you have some, you can swap out a team member. Often, however, the team will simply be stuck in opposite sleep/eating cycles, so that once one member is ready to go, the others are too hungry.

The game often wants you to use a person with x stat, but it won't tell you what stat the candidates have in that screen. 

Not to mention the inevitable EA jank, with soldiers not going on missions for ages etc.",0.0

Overall a nice addition to a the base management genre 
there is a lot of potential available for this game that I hope will be realized!

Pros: similar vibes to other games of it's type, the exotic setting will allow for a lot of plot expansion and it feels like there is a lot of room to expand into new mechanics should the devs decide to

the writing is quirky and appropriate for the different types of characters that are show cased

the art style and sound design are well done and seem rather polished for an early access title

Cons: current most egregious bug to me personally is a few pathing issues with the meeples, enemies and allies seem to have a chance to ignore built walls so be careful where you dig! 

There is a tutorial but it needs some more work on providing context, if you haven't played similar types of these games before you may be lost before looking up a Youtube video on how to proceed.

currently defending you base is more a balance of 'can i afford to rebuild my power network vs. can I afford to hire and keep enough guards to defend my power network' there isn't yet a lot of options beyond that. (no automated defenses that I had unlocked or could see in the tech tree)

in summary: 
the game is in early access and was just released. while there is a whole game, the gameplay experience feels like there is more on the horizon. If the concept of the game intrigues you I'd encourage you to vote with your wallet. Otherwise adding it to your wishlist and checking back in on it after it's had more time to bake would be a great idea too.",1.0

You don't have the same risk of losing a soldier immediately as in XCOM because you can always revive a soldier as long as you have a stimpack, but if you continuously have soldiers bleed out, you will run out of medical supplies and get squeezed in future missions. I really like that the weapons are energy weapons and ""vent"" rather than reload, which gives you the option of firing without venting and doing huge damage at the risk of very likely doing major damage to yourself as well. Functionally it ends up being basically a reload but the flavor of being able to roll the dice on an overheating weapon is really cool.

The classes are very distinct and unique - though its worth noting that some are much stronger than others (which I think is OK since this is a rougelike). I think the art and sound effects are on point, too. Shots and even the venting mechanic are very satisfying.

I play quite a few games but wouldn't call myself a roguelike, twinstick or shoot em up expert by any means and was able to beat the final boss for the first time on my 4th run.

As you can guess, in my opinion the game is on the easy side and especially does not provide much challenge after you get the hang of the gameplay loop. The standard enemies are simple and alright. Bosses are quite easy, however they are ""relatively"" varied in their attacks and environment hazards. 

For its price I personally think it is a good value game if you have money to spare or are into the genre. This game however does not provide the complexity and/or depth alot of roguelike/roguelite fans look for nor does it provide endless hours of content. To be fair, at its current pricepoint this is hardly a issue worth arguing.

As a side note for the developer:
The game became uncompleteable on that first ""succesful"" run. When I beat the boss I suddenly lost all my remaining health, stayed alive and for some reason was able to go into the abyss without getting respawned, dying or completing the game, as a result I was forced to reset.

+The chapter with Mr.Tops is very good. great ambience and if you play your cards wrong you will get jump scared i reckon.
+Loved the nods to various horror mediums (Babadook, C'thulu,Hellraiser) too name a few.
+Animations were really good for Mr.Tops as well. Likewise for voice acting.
+Pretty heavy on the puzzles after chapter 1.

-So the biggest one i encountered was a hard lock on my save file. I couldn't progress after a certain point. I posted this in the bug report forum. 
-Tension kind of goes out the window after chapter 1. Not necessarily a bad thing. But temper your expectations.

4139,136931323.0,2328760,"As a pinball fan, and owner of TPA (The Pinball Arcade), and FX3, here is a fairly in depth comparison. While I certainly enjoyed FX3 with its unique tables and creations, there is no question many were incredibly easy with the floaty physics of the balls. Tables like Doom, while very fun, were almost impossible to lose. When it came to the reproductions of classic tables such as Williams, it usually fell short of TPA by a margin. The physics always felt off, and while it made for a fun pinball game, it fell quite short of a pinball simulation. This new Pinball FX claims improved physics and graphics, not to mention Ray Tracing, which can be hard for some hardware, though it runs pretty smoothly on my laptop and its 2080 Super. So what is best?

[b]Physics[/b]

Since this is a selling point, I compared all three for feel, but to avoid falling into personal biases, I brought up actual video recordings on YouTube and used them as a reference. Frankly, FX is the winner here, and it shows up in the reactions of the ball, but also small things like falling through the hole in a slide on Arabian Nights. TPA is not far behind in some tables but not all. Curiously, TPA actually has some off-flippers and angles of flippers on some tables. I had no idea of this until observing the genuine video footage. So a win for FX overall. TPA seems to have a lighter incline on all the tables so it is hard to know exactly, and I always found TPA very solid overall.

[b]Graphics[/b]

This is going to come as a surprise but while FX has the potential to be the clear best, its graphics and lighting need serious tweaking. The table lights (using [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY2pFjj1Phg]original Williams tables[/url] to compare) are overly bright, creating exaggerated shadows. Some tables have outright wrong colors such as Arabian Nights. The lights near the bumpers are white instead of the actual yellow, as well as those around the table. The overall result is a much colder color scheme than the real table. 
What about Ray Tracing? Frankly, it is a serious disappointment as implemented for now. Side-by-side screenshots with it on and off show that the only visible result is a sharp increase in contrast, so darker areas are darker, effectively making the lights brighter by comparison. However, multi-point shadows and reflections and light bouncing is non-existent. So all you really get with RT is a darker table with deeper shadows. At least with the simulated Williams tables.

[b]Variety[/b]

In terms of simulated tables of old, TPA has an overwhelming edge still, with many many classics such as Firepower I and II, High Speed, and others, but TPA is a dead end, and WYSISWYG. FX is clearly very much alive not only for original creations (I had a hoot with the Snoopy table), but new classics are also being added. I read another user complaining about a mistaken magnet in Addams, but I have not tried it and cannot comment.

[b]Perks[/b]

Much like its predecessor, FX has a ton of added effects, such as flying scores, special effects and more. These can all be tailored to taste so that your game experience, if using a classic table, will not be distracted by these. However, they are a nice touch, no arguments.

[b]Cost[/b]

This is a very personal thing, so I will refrain from passing judgement. If you had tables from FX3, then you get them at 50% off here. I don't know what the cost in the US is, as I live in Brazil, but the average for the tables or bundles has been between $3-6. YMMV.

[b]Verdict[/b]

Right now, it stands as the best overall pinball experience for new tables and pure physics, but there are definitely areas to improve such as fixing the RT so it actually does more than deepen shadows, as well as fix the colors of lights and the general brightness of them. This is the only serious complaint I have, but it detracts from the overall impression.

Hunt the Night is a hardcore top down action rpg, imagine mixing the Legend of Zelda with Bloodborne's setting and Castlevania looking characters.  I won't beat around the bush, this game is tough as nails and you will die a lot, so if you're after a more casual romp, please turn around immediately. 

Combat is all right, it can be clunky and frustrating at times but it can also be exhilarating and very satisfying when you're weaving dashes in between melee attacks to then unload you guns onto the enemy before finishing it off with your dark magic, the bones are well structured, it just needed some more polish. Enemy variety could have also been better, especially since this game loves to throw you into wave gauntlets.

The game doesn't have a map, which can be annoying for some, who don't pay attention or talk to NPC's so they end up not knowing where to go next,  but there is an NPC in the game that will tell you which direction to go, so it's not really a big deal.  If anything Hunt the Night's biggest flaw is balance, which is probably the best flaw to have because it can be easily patched, the difficulty spike around mid game can be a bit too sadistic.

Overall Hunt the Night might not break any new grounds, but it melds together well tried formulas into an intriguing dark fantasy world filled with challenges to keep you coming back for more and conquer them once and for all.

4158,136932427.0,2368510,"THIS GAME IS A STEAL FOR A LITERAL DOLLAR

It's good to have something you can pick up and blast through in a short time.

I am a sucker for this kind of art style, reminds me of Ed McMillen, or Behemoth.
This game is a short, simple, shmup roguelike. Super fast paced, a quick burst of addicting adrenaline.
And highly polished! I can't believe it was made in such a short time frame.

Collect upgrades with every level as you blast your way through the adorable enemies with insanely satisfying sound design. The pop of the cannisters is good EVERY TIME. The day/night switch is neat too, you have to think about your upgrades because most have a good and a bad side, one for day, one for night. The screen will be crowded by the end,
but you will be extremely OP. The boss is still a bit of a challenge though.

Some other things I like:
The colors really pop.
I love the arcade machine aesthetic.
I like how fast and breezy a playthrough is, literal minutes.

If you need a fun but chaotic afternoon pick me up, this game is great fun.

4168,136932551.0,1976950,"Desktop Dungeons starts off you very simply. You click on squares you want to move to, click on enemies to attack them, click on glyphs to use them, enemies attack you only when you attack them, and explore to regenerate health and mana. Your ultimate goal is defeat the boss of each dungeon and the dungeons are relatively short. Just thirty minutes max for a dungeon if you take your time on some the harder ones. All this may deceive you into thinking Desktop Dungeons is a simple game. It is not. 

The difficulty curve in Desktop Dungeons is wonderfully done. At first the only mechanics you need to master are the ones I listed above. Then classes, kin, and various enemies are introduced that force you tackle them in a variety of ways. Some classes rely on glyphs to win and others struggle to use glyphs forcing you find alternative ways to win. Some enemies are nigh impervious to regular attacks and others attack back when you use magical attacks on them. The semi random nature of the game will force you into situations where you cannot use optimal combos to win. Sometimes you're playing a class that struggles to use magic against enemies that you need to attack with magic to kill. So after you master the basics of the game you then have to learn how to use the various classes optimally and what to do when you can't use them optimally. You get a feel for what enemies are easy in what situations and hard in others. You advance further into the game and suddenly you find dungeons and enemies where previous strategies don't work. Those enemies you could kill a few levels higher than you suddenly can't be killed that way anymore. You have to find out ever better ways of leveraging your bonuses. Finding ways to deal just a little more damage or take a little less so you can kill tougher enemies. You have to manage your resources even better. For someone brand new to the game each hurdle the game places in front of you can seem insurmountable at first glance. But the game does a fantastic job of pushing the player to be better without having them give up. All the simple systems in the game get combined in a wonderfully complex way that never feels impossible to understand because of how the game eases you into them. 

For people interested in the game but have never played it: make no mistake, this is very much a strategy/puzzle game. The later levels will require you to really sit down and use your brain to solve them. The game never goes so far as to require you to calculate stuff out in advance to win but it will require a fair amount of foresight instead of blindly doing whatever actions seem best at the time. 

For people who played or know about the original are checking out the remaster: there a great deal of small gameplay changes that all make the game better in my opinion. You can see if tiles have potions on them from the glow on adjacent tiles, the fighter class had a number of changes, and you can see enemies in the fog if you get close enough. These are just a few changes they made. The rewind feature is really nice. If the new perspective annoys you there is a button in the bottom left corner that gives you a full overview like in the original game. My only complaint is that the old artstyle is gone. The new 3d stuff is good but I adored the original art. 

Some last remarks for those who have read this far. The writing is very good and the humor in the game is very much in the same style as Terry Pratchet. The music is also great and very fitting for the feel of the game. My favorite track is Troll in A Minor if you want to look it up and give it a listen before buying the game. I should also mention that the devs were kind enough to give the remaster to everyone who bought the original game for free. A completely unnecessary gesture given how much work has gone into the remaster more than justifies the price. Although my opinion doesn't amount to much, I would like to finish by saying I think Desktop Dungeons is in the top 100 games ever made. I put it so low only because of how many amazing games have been made throughout history and not to say that Desktop Dungeons isn't THAT good. Every single part of the game is amazing well executed and the game's relative obscurity is mostly due to the genre's lack of popularity and not because the game has been found lacking.",1.0

4173,136930860.0,1976950,"Desktop Dungeon is a phenomenal puzzle dungeon crawler that truly tests your strategic thinking skills. The game's retro-style graphics are charming and give a nod to classic dungeon crawler games of the past, but the gameplay is anything but old-fashioned.

The game offers a unique blend of RPG-style mechanics and puzzle elements that requires you to carefully plan out each move, considering the strengths and weaknesses of your character and the enemies you're facing. As you progress through the game, you'll unlock new characters, items, and abilities that add even more depth to the gameplay.

One of the standout features of Desktop Dungeon is its accessibility. The game is designed to be played in short, bite-sized sessions, which makes it perfect for busy gamers who don't have a lot of time to sink into lengthy gaming sessions. Plus, the game's intuitive interface and helpful tutorial make it easy for players of all experience levels to jump right in and start playing.

My expectations were high for this game but it even managed to exceed them.

The artstyle is gorgeous and really good for a pixel graphic game. 
The combat system is fun but also punishing, especially since I play it on the highest difficulty. Its definitely not even close to being as hard as souls-like games but you cant just brainlessly spam attacks either.

The game does the same as Moonlighter and Ruined King, it spreads little notes with lore around the map you can read. As someone who played all of Riots games this is truly a treat for me. The boss fights are really fun so far and it doesn't feel like some other hack and slash titles where they just throw enemies at you for the sake of it.

I also like how this game depicts Sylas as a character with a strong personality who doesnt seem likeable at all times and more like a hothead. I am expecting him to have a positive character change developing with the story and im excited to see how this game will manage to make him likeable :D

I camped for the game release and played almost non-stop till now and cant wait to play more the following days.

Due to the nature of it being in early development, it does lack content and has a couple bugs. A couple suggestions to make this game more enjoyable without over complicating it would be:

Content:
- multiplayer to trade with friends
- a cathedral (solely for the aesthetic purpose, could possibly boost happiness)
- being able to move a building without having to completely demolish it
- horses or carts to allow stockpilers to move resources more easily
- more decorations/having decorations improve happiness
- more events (such as the witch)
- a night cycle (could have unique events or limited jobs like a tavern?)
- being able to replant Bob
- a flower shop to use flowers and boost currency
- allowing the villagers to use the dice table (or at least see them interact with their environment)
- showing a range on storage such as the granary or stockpile (able to be toggled)
- being able to place decorations on top of pathing

Bugs of notice:
- the villagers consistently starve even when you have a surplus of food
- villagers constantly get stuck (this may be ""where is my body,"" but I am not sure)
- the pigs cannot be moved or killed so you have to build around them
- certain buildings will not demolish (such as the condo)

Overall, this game is 100% worth your money. My friend and I have an hour/dollar rule in which a game is worth it's money if you play for the amount of hours you spent on the game ($1=1hour).

The first winter is fine, you get a secret santa gift when you don't have enough supplies. After that though, your villagers die off from starvation despite the fact that there is food available or die from sickness, despite the fact that there is a hospital in their area (and the hospital is only at 2 out of 8 patients). What's the deal? That's kind of annoying honestly. 

I  restarted my game after I unlocked the hospital on the first one and tried to deleted buildings to make room for the hospital (and rebuild the buildings somewhere else) and made a huge mess of things, out of almost 90 villagers I killed all but one from starvation... oops.

I love deckbuilding games and this was free, so I decided to try it out.  Game is easy to get into, and has a tutorial to explain the mechanics.  It plays like other deckbuilders, but has some unique aspects.  Instead of choosing a path, you are given card that represent enemies, shops, events, and treasure and have to assemble the path you want to take.  Each path ends with a miniboss and the third path ends in a boss fight.

You get two characters so far in the free version, one you start with and one you unlock.  Combat is well animated with pretty graphics.  Battles have you managing two different energies.  One for attacks and one for spells.  After beating an enemy you get an upgrade and about halfway through the second level, I was incredibly overpowered, and this snowballed to make the final level very easy.  The only issue was I had so many abilities that it would cause the game to lag each time I played a card, as it had to process all of the abilities triggered by the card.  This did lead to some lag spikes and once the game seemed to think I had ended my turn when I had not.

You can customize your character at the start by picking a god and zodiac sign.  These will made differences in your character, but I beat the game the first time I played it and I do not see a way to increase the difficulty.  This game could use that, because as it is, there is no reason to play again.  The game really should implement a scoring system so I could compete with my friends to see who can get a high score.

Controls are fine, it is easy to do starting boosts and drifting feels great.

Plenty to do for those who don't want to race with actual players such as unlocking parts to upgrade your favourite racers and mini missions to keep you going.
So for those worried it is P2W, so far I not really had issue leveling up any character and shop stuff is just minor colours or starter packs if you wanna give the character a jump-start in level or two but not needed at all to race and enjoy.

As for the tracks, I love them, some have added stuff to keep them fresh and their backward versions are enjoyable too, it took me a while to realise I was racing on some tracks backwards.

Lastly, the soundtrack is awesome, I can tell which franchise it is from and still love how they have remixed/made it more jumpy for the racing genre so look forward to getting the soundtrack when possible~

If you love racers I say give this one a shot even if just the standard version, otherwise you will have a fun game to look forward to when it comes F2P (said to be next year but who knows)

IF YOU ARE NEW TO DESKTOP DUNGEONS: This is a no-brainer recommendation. This game, while simple on the surface, is strategically deep and very unique - nothing else quite scratches the itch for me. There is a learning curve, but it's worth it!

IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE GAME: First of all, you can import your old kingdom if you link your account, so no re-grinding! Second, while the game is mostly the same, there are a few very smart adjustments. The first thing you'll probably notice is the new dungeon layout that is better suited to widescreen resolutions. There are also tweaks to classes like Fighter and Berserker. And of course, there's the namesake Rewind feature.

Like me, you may be turned off by DD:R's UI at first. It is very, very different from the original. When you're used to seeing the entire dungeon at once, it feels jarring to start zoomed in. Instead of having the most important UI items clustered together on one side of the screen, they are spread out across the perimeter. But give it a chance - it grew on me, and I think it will grow on you too. It should definitely be an improvement for new players -  there are subtleties like enemies facing towards you when they will strike first, and combat prediction now extends to all status effects.

I have one major complaint: No custom keybindings. This is an accessibility issue, and it frankly is unacceptable that a remastered game released in 2023 lacks it. It should have been one of the core features. Hopefully it is implemented down the road.

4213,136933715.0,1976950,"The best whimsical roguelike puzzle game with updated graphics and a much floatier zeppelin. A few small balance and gameplay changes have been included, which are mostly very welcome, and the devs have done an admirably thoughtful job updating a few bits of fluff as well. I'm not crazy about the central Rewind feature itself letting you reset a run once to an earlier point and retry from there as currently implemented but I think people who have yet to pour as many hours into it as I have will probably appreciate it.

One of my favourite ever games. I've been playing it since the beta of the original game 10 years ago. Evil goats everywhere.",1.0
4214,136933367.0,1976950,"Disregard some of the negative reviews you see here; there has been a misinformation campaign pushed that the devs did not agree to nor advertise. 

IF you see negative reviews that complain about ""being lied to"", they were not. This is a revamp of the OG game. I own and have owned the OG game for quite a while, I playtested this game. Dev ran a promo that some devs do for people who own an OG copy of a game before a date (that's before today and before the OG one was put free for a promo). 

The smooth brained logic is ""Well, reddit said that I get both games for free since the OG one is free I want my free copy of this updated game that took hundreds upon hundreds of dev hours to code because it's free because reddit said it's free.""

No, this game is not free if you didn't own the OG one before the cut off date. It is on a discount, and for as chonky as the game is, the full price is worth it.

This says I only have .8 hours. That's false, I have far more across all iterations of the OG games elsewhere and playtested this one. 

What is this game? It's a roguelike puzzle-like that has dynamic elements which are more chaotic and does not have victory as an assurance with careful planning intermixed with a puzzle mode with set dungeons and set patterns that are totally mathematical and able to be beat.

If you played the OG one, but, for some reason don't own it on Steam, Rewind was built the way a remake/remaster should be done. It is 1:1 with the OG, while also adding stuff too, and the graphical upgrade is fantastic.

The game is set with a twisted sense of humor that, if you're one of the now endangered species of folk like I feign to be, and have that dwindling and more rare per day due to reddit and facebook and twatter,  that golden goose called wit, you'll probably enjoy that. Otherwise... IDK what to tell you.

Speaking of reddit. Just because reddit says it's so does not make it so.. I mean... ffs... the spirituality subreddit is taken over by ""white light, nobody has an original self and all news is lies, there's not dire situations affecting the world and we're all the shchizophrenic universe trying to understand itself, so we don't have a reason to have authentic personalities or critical thinking because woo woo bs."" Did reddit have a golden age? IDK, sifting through that mess is just about as bad as it was sifting through the septic tank that is facebook for a while, it's just getting waste... err waist... high and not ankle high, and people pounce on others with weak gacha's they've got to almost beg for someone to set up, with replies that're absolutely devoid of any intelligence whatsoever. Am I missing a good side of reddit? IDK, maybe I am, however, the point is... Dev would announce a promo like ""Hey, get both games for free."" here on Steam and on their discord. No such promo was ever promised, and anyone who gets a copy of this game for free did so because one promo was to give it free to people who bought the OG; Giving the OG game for free for a span of time was also a cool deal they have going on for a few days, damned generous to give both games away free to separate audiences. Neither of these promo's overlaps, and don't believe the BS that they do.

They're an indie team ffs, if you want to gripe about someone not giving you something for free, Ubisoft/EA/Blizzard have your number, and will happily give you many free games that come with an inbuilt casino that gets you addicted to pay for the free game.

Devs gotta eat, and, imo, these devs are being EXTREMELY generous by offering those two separate promo's at the same time on top of a launch discount. 

Yes, I did receive this game for free, no, I did not receive the OG one for free, which is why I got this one for free, I've owned the OG one for years on Steam. Also, no, just because I get a game for free that's paid, that does not inhibit me from being brutally honest and tearing into a game done bad, this game is genuinely a good game, and I thoroughly encourage you to at the very least try the demo if it's still available, or, if this is before the cut off date later on in the month, snag the OG one and try it out to see if you like it, if you do, then, this is worth the money spent.

Finally, this is the only game I've had an external sign on for that didn't wipe my saves between devices. This includes my OG save from my first kingdom. I was able to play it in browser, on the old laptop, then another laptop, also my phone when Elite Dangerous destroyed that other laptop, and this one, in the original version and the new rewind version.

4219,136933426.0,1457080,"So the game is good, it's not worth $30 at all, it should be $15 or something. The game seems approximately 10-ish hours. I got this number based on the frequency of achievements every time I finished a mission (around 10 to 15 mission achievements). And the DLC is not worth it. Seriously, the Spells Pack is Riot Forge trying to get more money from the consumers, things like that should NEVER be locked behind your wallet.  

The gameplay so far (and based on other comments and videos i have seen) is a fair-paced rouge*LITE*. The combat area is similar to Wizard Of Legend (a better-priced game that uses magic quite well). If you are looking for the fast-paced movement of Hades, you will not find it here. BUT if you have played games like Wizard Of Legend, Binding Of Issac, and Dead Cells (Excluding the bizarre movement speed you can reach in Dead Cells) then you might like the pacing of this game. 

The combat can be clunky and monotonous if you ONLY button mash and you don't try to be creative in your attacks. Using the chains to follow up and (insert your attacks here) is one example of doing this. 
Despite only having an hour in as of writing this, I am fully aware that the gameplay will still be the same, as for the graphics and quality it is purely subjective.

The lack of voice acting should not be a reason to dislike the game. While it is true Riot Forge could have done more, it should not be the sole reason to dislike it. 

TLDR:

A great game made by Digital Sun (seriously Moonlighter is good and try out 11 Bit Studios games as well) and a very pleasant time. However, it shouldn't be priced so high for such a short game (keep in mind I hypothesize it to be 10 ish hours). Best to wait for a sale, but that is the choice of the publisher. Since it is Riot that published it, don't expect one anytime soon. 

But if you really want to play the game, i'd say go for it. Once you unlock the forge stop the game and think if you REALLY want to spend money on this game or refund it. Personally, I want to keep playing so I'll take the hit.",1.0

Minecraft Legends boasts good graphics and a cel-shaded style reminiscent of Borderlands and Minecraft trailers.

The game mechanics are fun and engaging, and the feature set is interesting, with players able to construct and control minions like golems, send allies to collect resources, and build structures in an Age of Empires style.

Cons:
The quests can be repetitive, such as defending villages and slaying mobs, leading to boredom.
The storyline is slow and uninspiring, which might not keep players engaged.
The price point of the game is a little high, considering its current features. However, it could be improved with future updates.
Overall, Minecraft Legends has some great aspects, including graphics, open world, game mechanics, and feature set. But, the game needs to work on its quest variety, storyline, and price to keep players engaged in the long run.",1.0

Sausage Bomber is apparently a popular mobile game that came out a while back and Dogfight is that developer's attempt to make a shmup spin-off of it. It's short and on the default difficulty, not particularly hard, but it does play well and has some neat features to encourage replayability.

You have 4 characters to choose from, though they are purely cosmetic in difference. Up to 4 player local-only co-op is supported, but you could also use Steam Remote Play to play online with others off a single copy. Every level has a star rating based on how well you play and the more stars you collect across all your saves, the more of the rather extensive weapon catalog you'll unlock. Some weapons are definitely notably better than others, but it gives you a lot of different playstyles to experiment with and it's nice that it doesn't have to be done off a single save slot.

Strangely, though Dogfight has a fairly robust scoring system, there are no leaderboards of any kind, offline or online. I'm not sure why they'd bother putting together a scoring system and then provide no way to track it.  There is an interesting speedrun system where a timer is attached to each save and you can have the game increase its speed every time you kill an enemy (and decrease when you get hit), up to 1.6x normal speed to encourage shorter playtimes. There are also local stats tracked for your speedruns, which makes the lack of score leaderboards even stranger. Still, it's neat to see a game embrace speedrunning in its core mechanics like this.

Honestly, the price for this is pretty steep given the content on offer, unless you want to play it multiple times through to get all the unlocks or compete for speedrunning times. It's not a bad shmup by any means and I enjoyed my time with it, but was surprised to see the price afterward.",1.0

4260,136936777.0,1457080,"One of Riots weakest aspects as a corporation/ game development company is the stories they write- i.e, they don't. At least, not anymore. For the past 5-6 champions, lore surrounding them has been pretty bare-bones.
When Sylas first came out, he actually had a really interesting story- however, Riot being Riot, did not elaborate on it at all. They also tried to both-sides the story a little bit (Demacia is very fascistic), which always rubbed me the wrong way. Sylas, while not necessarily a good guy, is definitely in the right in his story.

Mageseeker really adds a lot more to Sylas' character. This is the first time I've really seen or felt him being portrayed in a more sympathetic light- Sylas is clearly a broken man. He doesn't want to go into dungeons all that much, he seems to have a hard time making friends. While I'm still fairly early on in the game and I don't think the story is anything to take to the presses, I greatly appreciate that Sylas' character gets a bit more exploration in this.

The gameplay loop is... interesting. Initially, I did not expect the amount of upgrades that would be available, but the more mages you recruit into your camp, the more you can upgrade aspects of your character. There's honestly more depth in the system than I would have expected when I started the game. The combat is fun, if a little mindless. The ability to steal and use the magic of other mages is really cool, but its implementation is a little clunky, even with mouse+keyboard. Having to press shift+ right mouse while also hovering over the specific target can be tedious, especially in combat when there are so many enemies around.

The art is, I think, a bit of an acquired taste. In the over world, characters are sparsely detailed, but their silhouettes are very identifiable, so it's not like it's messy or confusing. Character art during dialogue looks a little awkward to me, but that could be because I'm used to Riots portraits. The actual environments are nice, but it does sometimes feel a little constrained in that corridors feel very narrow, and even battle arenas feel small at times (though they do vary them up quite a bit, which I appreciate). I imagine that, as I continue playing, I'll get to see a little more of how Digital Sun decided to depict Runterra- Demacia is, canonically, very large, and has a lot of interesting biomes you can play with (still hoping to see some petricite forests). 
I am a little confused as to why there's no voice acting in the game, as I would think it wouldn't be that difficult to get Sylas' voice actor given Riots notoriety, but that may have been a decision on Digital Suns part. The music feels very in-line with Leagues music in that its not very boisterous, but its still a good listen, and you do notice it if you pay attention.

Overall, I've enjoyed my time with the game thus far. Maybe my opinion will change as I play through, but I think Digital Sun is really good at beat-em-ups, so I can't imagine I'll dislike it all that much.",1.0

 Progression feels impactful, whether that be new weapon mods, team perks, or new heroes. The price is fair for the content - I think I would spend up to $20 on this game in it's current state.  I am hopeful for additional story, characters, etc dlc - and I think they should charge for it since the game is only like $12 and I would like them to continue with this genre, which requires funds.  I am very impressed!!",1.0

""Well, we just had the displeasure of experiencing what can only be described as a soulless and predatory excuse for a cart racer. This game lacks any of the charm, polish, or heart that we have come to expect from a Disney-branded product.

From the moment we launched the game, we were bombarded with predatory monetization tactics that left a bad taste in our mouths. It's clear that the developers were more interested in squeezing every penny out of their customers than creating a fun and engaging game.

But even if we look past the monetization, The game play is uninspired. A truly Middling experience.

It's truly disappointing to see such a beloved brand being tarnished by a game that clearly prioritizes profits over quality. We can't in good conscience recommend this game to anyone, and we hope that Disney takes a hard look at the developers they are partnering with in the future.

In short, this game is a cheap cash grab that fails to deliver on any level. We give it two thumbs down.""",0.0

📜 [b]Intro[/b]
Deathchron is an action and platform game with an 8-bit style quite similar to the nes games with a limited color palette and music, like the games of that time Deathchron does not have a deep story so is simple and barely understandable is explain with a few images: you find a robot, you drive it, you kill enemies and you save the world.
There are 5 different levels and the selection of these is through a screen where the physical locations of these levels are shown and you select the desired level very similar to megaman but with the big difference that the levels are locked and you have to follow a linear order yes or yes, which makes this type of level selection screen meaningless, the game pays a lot of tribute to 8-bit games with a beautiful and well-detailed pixel style as well as the sound track but this last ends up being poorer because all the levels share the same song even in the fighting with bosses which takes away epicism since it is very tiring to listen to the same music all game.

🎮 [b]playable mechanics[/b]
The game is in 2D with classic gameplay of moving forward, jumping and shooting enemies, several enemies are capable of shooting so you constantly have to dodge enemy shots by jumping, the robot has a 3-state health bar which you can increase with upgrades from the menu by spending pieces that enemies drop and special orbs that reward you when you solve a special puzzle or kill a boss (currently the system is bugged so you can infinitely collect an orb if you collect it and then die), these upgrades in addition of life there are also special weapons, they have their own ammunition, the bad thing is that to reload a single bullet these special weapons you have to use a container [E] which are limited and also serves to restore your life so if you want to reload special weapons you can't heal yourself.
An added mechanic is the possibility for the child to get off the robot to go through small places or climb stairs to solve puzzles on occasions necessary to advance and on others for special items, the child's mobility is limited as well as his life ( which is reduced to 1), it is not highly recommended to get out of the robot often since the child can only jump one block so if you move away from the robot it is likely that you will not be able to return to it and you will end up stuck.
The level design is generally good, it feels entertaining and challenging, in addition to keeping elements typical of the games of that time, such as the typical water that is instakill, as well as the enemies that shoot at you while you jump, jumping into the water and having to start from the last save point.
Each level has a themed boss with the environment of the level, the visual design is magnificent but the playable one not so much since some of the bosses' attacks seem unavoidable especially the first boss.

💭 [b]Conclusion[/b]
The game is short and visually it is fantastic, it really looks like an 8-bit game from past times but with current gameplay as well as fluid control, but unfortunately it cannot be recommended for purchase in its current state, the game has many bugs such as getting stuck in certain places, that of the infinite improvement objects and worst of all, the possible corruption of the saved game in which it can take you to another more advanced level and with the corrupted level making it impossible to continue and having to start the game from the biginning. If these severe bugs are solved you can give it a try since the game is cheap and is entertaining.

I'm going to preface this review by saying that I actually like the game. 
I love the show Stargate, and this is the Stargatge game I've always wanted. 
I also plan to continue playing the game, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone right now. I've run into quite a few bugs and I've only been playing for 2 hrs.
I have to create a new save every time I save the game, which isn't game breaking. Its just annoying.
My worker-bots keep being idle even when there is work to do and i have plenty of money (maybe there is a reason why they're not working that I'm not aware of?).
But the worst bug I've come across is my camera not panning. About every 10 minutes or so my camera will freeze and I'm unable to move around (I can still zoom in and out though). The only way to fix it is to log out of the game. 

The game is also lacking visually. All the rooms are very bland looking and there really Isn't any customization or decorating options. I know its suppose to look like a government facility, but it doesn't need to look THAT boring. 

Overall, it looks promising. But it is going to need a lot more content and some major bug fixes to be worth the price tag.",0.0

4329,136940137.0,1851030,"While I haven't played fighting games past a casual level, I am a huge rhythm game nerd and am having a blast playing this game.

I see a lot of reviews complaining about the lack of a vertical scrolling option, and I honestly do not think it should be added SOLELY on the basis of convenience. Hear me out.

I can play some of the hardest charts of Museca, Jubeat, Chunithm, Guitar Hero, Groove Coaster, Taiko, Crossbeats, Muse Dash, Osu!, and Osu!mania. I greatly enjoy but suck at Pop'n, SDVX, and PIU doubles. 

Why did I bother listing those? If you look them up, almost all of them have a different take on how a player hits notes. Some of them are super intuitive and can be learned quickly (for me, Jubeat), but some of them can take extra practice to learn even if you have an extensive rhythm gaming background (Taiko and SDVX). Different people pick up different games faster, even some of the ""hard"" games can be easy for some folks to learn.

In the same way, some fighting games are pretty intuitive in their controls (smash), while other games require a lot of learning and practice before you even remotely begin to feel like you're experiencing the intended gameplay (skullgirls).

I think it is entirely okay for God of Rock to come out with a new take on rhythm games in the form of a difficult 4-key horizontal lane. It just means you probably can't hit the ground running and be a pro. You actually have to take time to learn the controls, figure out what keybinds work for you, and above all else practice if you want to be decent. Just like a lot of the harder rhythm AND fighting games.

I generally think the game is challenging. If you're not used to reading streams and patterns, ESPECIALLY in a horizontal format like Taiko, this game will be really, really hard.

If it's purely an ACCESSIBILITY issue, as in no matter how much a person practices they can't physically read the notes coming in sideways, then yes by all means please add a vertical option if possible. Make the game accessible. But if it's just for the sake of convenience? I'm okay with this game taking me extra time to feel comfortable. The game doesn't need to be convenient and easy to learn, but it will limit the number of people willing to play (just look at other reviews lol). 

So I guess it's up to the devs to decide which matters more, a small audience of players willing to improve to be able to play, or a wider audience. I was looking for a challenging rhythm game, and that's exactly what I got, so I overall recommend it if you're looking for that.",1.0
4330,136941390.0,1537830,"[h1] Not recommending at the present time for a number of reasons, each explained below later. TLDR at the end.[/h1]

First, let's talk about the positives.

Gameplay is great. Short learning curve for basic mechanics (driving, items, etc.), and races are very exciting. I'm having fun in every single one. I've been playing single-player for my first couple of hours, but the bots are competitive, so you won't be disappointed if you want higher difficulty. 

There's plenty of modes, whether you want to play single-player or online. You start with a ""starter circuit"" that you need to progress on in order to unlock the other modes. If you want to race as Mickey, Donald or Goofy, you're in luck because you unlock those characters within the first hour or so.

Graphics and the overall look/feel of the game is good. Soundtrack lowkey slaps (remixes of classic Disney songs in electronic/club style) However the cars look extremely generic. Would have loved it if each of the characters drove in their own themed cars like Mario Kart but the liveries for the cars fit the characters well. 

Another thing I want to say is how blown away I was when they announced Figment as a character. As a fan of the Disney Parks and the lore/history surrounding the character, I can appreciate him coming into the limelight more. And if Figment was the first Parks related character that the devs announced (he IS in the Walt Disney World collection), I can bet that they're going to add more as the seasons come and go. (Hell, we even got our first Dreamfinder reference in YEARS, even if he's only a crew member. And I can appreciate seeing Orange Bird and Sonny Eclipse as well. Huge surprises.) The Figment announcement is what compelled me to buy the game in the first place.

Which brings me to the negatives; of which there are a few:

The amount of grinding one will have to do in order to obtain the characters/cosmetics/upgrades and whatnot will be long as hell. This is because this game is designed like a typical mobile/gatcha game. The amount of microtransactions here are overwhelming. No game should have FOUR in-game currencies. It will take me a LONG time to unlock Figment because he is the rarest character in the game, and the whole character shards thing being pegged to the rarity level makes it even worse. You also can't unlock the loot box that these shards are in unless you have 10,000 ""season coins"" that can mostly only be unlocked if you have the season/battle pass. (I will say that the standard founders pack gives you two credits towards your first two passes, but after that, it's money out of your pocket.) 

There's also no excuse for early access and the standard founders pack to be worth $30. Most people can wait until the game goes free-to-play later this year. It just isn't worth it for most people just to be able to unlock special skins and be a couple steps ahead of everyone else. I have heard that people aren't receiving refunds on their editions since it is technically DLC and cannot be returned. Really scummy thing to do. 

I also think the whole upgrading/crew experience is more complicated than it needs to be. I think many people will find it overwhelming. This also kinda plays into the microtransactions; if you want your car to go faster, drift better, etc. then you either grind for a long time or pay your way up.

Overall, for the average person, I would definitely wait until this goes free-to-play if you want to check this out. Early access isn't worth it, at least for me. But everyone is different. If you really like Disney characters and love kart racing, and simply can't wait a few months, then go ahead and get it. It really is a fun kart racer, but the obvious cash-grab elements and convoluted progression system stick out like a sore thumb. I hope Gamestop and Disney can get their act together on these fronts. 

[b]TLDR: The game is fun, graphics are good, and Figment is in it,  but the convoluted progression and microtransactions are overwhelming. Do NOT shoot for early access if you have any doubts about it, it's not worth it for most people. Wait for the game to go free-to-play. If any of the negatives significantly improve, I'll update the review accordingly, but in it's present state, the game needs some work.[/b]

4332,136941130.0,1537830,"I don't think this is worth buying atm. You should wait until it exits early access. The racing feels great with a very big caveat being that you are forced to level up each racer, level up their star level and these require a variety of currencies to achieve. The multiplayer mode where everyone picks a character and you're on a level playing field is great. The game is fast and the items have multiple uses. Each character has a unique power up as well. I think the tracks are a joy to race on too. Lots of different paths or rails to grind which offer some strategy. It's just held back by the f2p monetization. It's just so egregious. 3 different currencies, currencies to level up each racer by franchise and type. Then you need to collect multiple of each racer to level up their star power... It just never ends. It's a shame because it is a fun game and I am enjoying it, but I wish I had known how deep the microtransactions went. Also it's a bit messed up that you get a free character unlock with early access but the game doesn't show you the character rarity until after you pick one. Meaning I got stuck with a less rare and easier to acquire character.",0.0

I'm engaged in it a lot more than I expected to be.  Don't be like me and just skip all of the tutorials at first, they're well done and informative without wasting too much of your time explaining obvious nonsense.

One thing that isn't great is the quality of the display.  It's pretty clear that they didn't do a high resolution version of the UI as at 4K it looks soft and blurry as if it's just been crudely upscaled, so the presentation isn't great.

I think I've actually been playing this game since its inception, I was probably in middleschool when I found this game. I remember when this game looked absolutely horrible and I still played it many weekends as a kid. It's been pretty neat watching the game evolve over the years. I wonder if I found it on gamemaker studios or just from googling roguelike rpgs.

But this is a pretty good roguelike puzzle rpg. It starts off fairly simple, but very quickly the game starts to get very difficult and you have to start to learn how to push every mechanic at your disposal to its absolute limit. Sometimes you might find a very powerful combo or exact counter to a level instead. You'll even start this game thinking a few race class combos are best but then you'll come across a mechanic that requires completely different types of builds. It stays fresh pretty well and there's a lot of challenge to try to overcome.

I have been pretty excited to buy this and was really trying to give it some hope but at the end of the first day I am just sitting here pretty happy to be done playing it. Personally it is not frustrating but I was just super bored and I have played some pretty long RTS matches. Nothing happens for most of the match, it feels like its a stale mate up until its gone so long that people loose focus about defense. It takes already a long time to get into a match and I dont feel like I sit here wondering what I could of done better or what I want to change about my strategy for the next match. I absolutely dont think the multiplayer mode has longevity, I feel like the audience this game is probably going to attract does not have a deep sense for strategy for this type of game, nothing against them but it is already apparent to me that most of my teammates do not even understand what is going on. I know it is day one but its so bad that I cant hope for it to get much better. I have been the only one building defenses and when it comes to attacking everything feels week except the redstone launcher.

- The inability to conduct Teamwork
In many of the promotional content for this game, they really talk about the teamwork as being a main aspect of the game, yet there is no text chat nor voice chat. In addition, it is extremely difficult to play with friends in versus mode. You cannot queue with friends unless its a private match. You have to host or join a public game where you cannot even change teams to play on your friend's team. It seems the dev team said, ""this game is fun on lan, lets release it"". 

- No reason to play pvp except momentary fun
In comparison to other pvp competitive multiplayer games, this game fails to even come close to caring about the pvp mode. No leaderboards, no rewards, no nothing for winning. If you want to make a competition gamemode, at least capitalize on it by adding more fun things to it.

I like this game but, at this price, there needs to be more effort. I'm sure there are more cons to talk about but these two are the most important to me.",0.0

Well, it runs fairly smoothly. There's absolutely nothing to it though and if these guys are coding students, I don't know who is teaching them but they seem to have missed the bit where they create a worthwhile Hack and Slash game. These kids could be leaving university with a steady income if they'd just put a bit more game in their game. I would like to see a sequel with a bit more ultrawide aspect ratios support, some information about the abilities, lift all the good features from Hack and Slash (and Hades is NOT a stand out of the genre btw - it's simply one of the least bad ones that's still going), zoom out about 500% because this is to Hades as Duplo is to Lego at the moment. The game has 3 enemy types which is incredibly boring and there's no information about the levels that are coming etc etc etc.

I've no idea what they were learning from this - the only thing I can guess is that perhaps it's about the code in the background? It wasn't lagging even running at speed so maybe they created a hyper efficient code base in comparison to Hades which can really lag when it's got a lot of stuff on screen. Who knows?

4361,136942096.0,1183800,"This is a wonderful indie game that hits the XCOM tactical gameplay just right. I want to preface this review by saying while I am unlikely to play more than 10-15 hours of this game, I am absolutely happy to support an indie dev who knows the essence of the genre.

The good: I have ~1000 hours in the XCOM franchise at this point and all of my intuitions on how to play the game came into play here. It feels like home, but your furniture is spewing rats and your plasma got replaced by steampunk. The art, weapon sfx, and music all elevate the experience.

The bad: It's pretty short and pretty easy. I ran through the whole game on my first attempt on normal difficulty and by about halfway through the second of three chapters, I could kill pretty much every enemy before it could ever attack me, and I stopped taking damage. My squad was the starting group of Mycroft, Tilly, Gideon, Michael, and support bot. Between Gideon's mass overwatch picking off half of a pod as it entered range, Tilly's reaper (not actual name) and unmissable melees, Mycroft's 6 free action shots (each having a chance to proc hair trigger and refund 2ap), Michael granting extra actions, and the support bot preventing weapons from overheating, nothing stood a chance. My stockpile of grenades, stimpacks, and fusion cores swelled to the point of not even considering how many I had because I would never spend all of them. Enemy progression stopped with vermin elites that equate somewhere around advanced advent MECs, so there were never capital threats like the Sectopod, Gatekeeper, or Ethereal to really set the pace for a pod.

The nitpicking: As great as the art is, it became a little hard to distinguish some of my characters from each other as well as some enemies from each other. This would probably be resolved with time, but being unable to see unit names unless you're targeting them is unfortunate.

I know I just spent a lot of words saying how not great this game is, but it's much harder to describe how many of the little design decision I really do love. Maybe a play through on hard is warranted to see the full extent of the game's difficulty but at the end of the day I wouldn't want to see any real changes to the core systems. Small but well-made and fun.",1.0

As a solo player, my first impressions were pretty good for an alpha game. I liked the basic gameplay although it needs to be fleshed out a lot more. The guns were pretty well done and I kept finding more as I went on so there are at least a few choices. The inventory system works fine enough but the health and food needs some work so that it feels needed or balanced enough to be even worth picking up. The bosses looked good but the AI needs some work as they still can get stuck on a lot of things. I feel like adding some randomly generated elements to the world in the future would be a good call. Overall, I think that this game has a lot of potential and be very fun once it's finished if the devs don't give up and listen to what their players want.

My biggest gripe with this game is that everytime you die to a boss, you have to sit through the dialogue, and while there is a fast forward button for that, it doesn't speed up the cutscenes. Hopefully this will be addressed in a future update. The game also does a good job at explaining the lore behind Demacia, why it exists, and why the Mageseekers exist.

I'm going to avoid major spoilers altogether and try to spoiler tag things that I could see being interpreted as a minor spoiler.

I finished one playthrough of the main storyline and a lot of the side content
[h1] having played on keyboard + mouse and the middle of the three starting difficulties [/h1]

[b] Combat: Good, but not perfect [/b]
The combat system itself is wonderful, I felt powerful throughout my entire playthrough, and never got bored with how diverse the approaches to fights get despite the fact I played far from optimally in regards of using what everything that was at my disposal.
There only were two instances where I felt like enemy attacks were not fair, but that was primarily due to the reason I had no idea how to avoid them at first.
There are sliders that allow you to change difficulty at any point during the game.
While I felt that when I was defeated, it was deserved, yet not too punishing...
[spoiler] It also seems to me like at certain part of the game, the protagonist's power started accelerating too much compared to the opponents he would face, just due to how much effective health you can get. I mostly felt like the middle of the game was a bit too easy in comparison to the rest.
Also some bosses were way too easy, in my opinion. [/spoiler]

[b] Story: I loved it!  [/b]
As someone who's been familiar with the main character's story long before playing the game, I was eager to learn more. And the game certainly did not disappoint. However, I think the game did a good job of explaining the fundamentals for those who may not know much about the protagonist or anything else that's going on.

[b] Visuals + audio: Amazing [/b]
I honestly don't know if I have much to say here, I think the artstyle and the sound design were both on point and created levels I really enjoyed exploring.

[b] Achievements: [/b]
[spoiler] You can certainly get most of them within one playthrough. [/spoiler]

[b] Flaws: Nothing ruined my playthrough, however... [/b]
- The worst of all in my opinion - The dash that you use for moving around and fast forwarding dialogue both being assigned to spacebar. Unexpected dialogue caused me to skip several things accidentally, especially at the beginning.
- Unkillable enemies? During the whole playthrough, I stumbled upon two regular enemies that I have slain multiple times before, but one was just immune to damage even when it normally shouldn't have been, and the other seemed to have their healthbar bugged out. However, I could just walk past both of them and continue my adventure.
- I had to reload a level one time because I was limited in how often I could dash for some reason, after the reload the dashing was back to normal.
- Spelling errors in places where they really shouldn't have been. [spoiler] The intentional spelling errors were great, though. [/spoiler]

The environment is cute and colourful, The building mechanic is nice and simple for anyone to learn and OMG CREEPERS A HECKIN CUTE!!! 

I will say that this isn't a True RTS and honestly, it works for MC: Legends. Like if this was a True RTS, I reckon it would of flopped hard. Like you can still do your hardcore strategies, you just gotta think Minecraft based more with it. Example: You see many walls, just build a Redstone Launcher. I haven't done too much in the campaign yet. (Gonna Co-op it with friend) But from what I have done solo, the potential of wacky shenanigans is quite limitless and I hope they do expand on it more. 

The Graphics for this are clearly children friendly but if you were expecting like StarCraft or Age of Empires level of detail in MC: Legends, you are a fool and should perish. Minecraft has always been aimed mostly for a younger audience but still is for anyone's enjoyment and the Dev team did really well making the universe. 

Now for the downsides, I don't have too much negativity for MC: Legends, more just potentially seeing more Quality of Life changes, I would love to see a server list for Verses in the game to just find games that are missing 2 or 3 players to start and also be able to pair up with friends to search together, I've struggled with some connection issues with Verses mode and that I will assume would be an easy fix. Day One Launches are always hectic anyway and maybe just better in game communication methods, not a chat feature but at least like better pings.

The biggest reason that [i]you[/i] might not want to pick up Exogate, though, is that it's pretty darn tough to get any sort of sustainable base going.

You will have bases run completely out of funds multiple times before you figure out how to stand a chance of making it to the later unlocks.

From the moment I started playing, the relaxed environment was very inviting. The colorful graphics and calming music made me feel like I was really taking care of pets in a peaceful setting.

Playing with and taking care of the pets in the game was a fantastic stress reliever. It was clear that the game's creators put a lot of thought and care into making sure that players had everything they needed to take care of their furry friends. There were plenty of toys, treats, and activities to keep the pets happy and healthy.

The building in the game was super clean and fun. The rooms were brightly colored and well-designed, and it was clear that the pets were comfortable and happy. The attention to detail was impressive, with cute little touches like pet beds and toys scattered throughout the rooms.

Finally, I have to say that the game itself was surprisingly addicting. I found myself playing it for hours on end, trying to take care of as many pets as possible and unlock new rooms and features. The gameplay was engaging and fun, and the challenge level was just right - not too easy, but not too frustrating either.

I think a lot of people who picked up this game just bought it because it was Minecraft branded, and do not actually enjoy pikmin/RTS stuff.

Controls: perhaps badly explained (the CTRL menu is much easier to work with than Q/E) but very satisfying to have mastered.

Piglin outpost destruction: Fun, but you definitely want the Cure Netherrack ability before anything else.

Resource collection: I love spamming a bunch of allays in one location and watching things get vaporised.

Building: Can be clunky when you start out and don't understand how stuff works. This especially applies to ramps, which I did not really understand until the midgame. However, I really like it now that I know how it works.

Village defense: I love how it isn't scripted, if you don't defend a village it will fall.

Villages: Very useful to get a resource top-up if there isn't any of it nearby.

Units: There are no units that don't have a unique ability, I find myself using different types of them for different stages of invasion during the really tough outposts/portals. (Skeletons sniping towers on cliffs above them my beloved)


Evidently not for everyone, as shown by the mixed reviews, but it's their fault for picking up a game just because it was Minecraft themed. The micro-transactions don't bother me, they're just cosmetics and it's not like dungeons didn't have DLC or skins of its own.

4454,136947808.0,1457080,"I was really hyped for [i]The Mageseeker[/i] since Sylas is probably my favorite champion in LoL in terms of both gameplay and character/story. And, after playing through about half of the game, it somewhat delivered on what I liked about Sylas's story and character. However, I found that the controls make the gameplay fall really short of Sylas's LoL fantasy.

In LoL, he's a mobile bruiser with really fast and smooth combos (who also copies spells), which is one of the main reasons I play Sylas so much; and I'd say I'm pretty good at him. This is the opposite of how it feels to me in this game.

The controls just feel too clunky, sort of like playing League without quick-cast on. I often end up trying to fight my own keyboard more than I fight the actual enemies. And I'd say that I'm at least decent at top-down action games (I can consistently win runs in games like Hades on high difficulty).

That said, here are the specifics of what I'm talking about (on PC at least):
[list]
 [*] I think it would be much better if you could Abduct (hook) and Hijack (steal) without having to press Aim first. Because right now, pressing 4 buttons just to perform 2 SETUP actions feels terrible.

 [*] Additionally, it would also be much better if you didn't need to press a button to select your spell before casting it (i.e. pressing the spell's button just straight up casts it, like having quick-cast on in League). Because, again, pressing 2 buttons to perform 1 action (which need to be pressed sequentially and not simultaneously) just slows down gameplay a lot.

 [*] I also dislike how weird the timing for the various combos are. I can't tell if it's because of the input time/buffering being really poorly implemented, the lockout time on animations being wonky, or just me being bad.

 [*] This is a much smaller grievance, but having any sort of slow ""heavy attack combo"" at all just doesn't feel good on Sylas.
[/list]

And this isn't even getting into what other people have mentioned about the overinflated price tag for a game that's probably only worth 1/3rd the current price (which doesn't even include the small DLCs). Some of the main issues that don't justify that price tag are: the lack of voice acting, relatively short total length, mediocre story. 
I'm fine with the other aspects, but they're not exactly amazing.

[b]Overall, my rating of the game is still positive and I'd love to see more from Riot Forge, but I can't, in good faith, tell others to actually buy this game.[/b]

4483,136950346.0,1928870,"It appears as if reviews for this game are mixed... Mixed as in split between people who came to it for the RTS side, and people who only came for the Minecraft side.

This game is very much, an RTS game. it's convoluted nature is commonplace with alot of RTS out there, and due to the attempt at being toned down, It most likely won't be as bad as other RTS games. I'd say the co-developer 'Blackbird Interactive' are trustworthy, as they seem to have developed games such as Homeworld 3 and Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak.

The main complaint is the lack of content, I saw someone saying that the campaign lasted for 2 hours, which is abnormal since it took me an hour and a half to even complete the tutorial? but the game does change from a storied linear pattern to a open world RTS where you defend against a 'Dynamic' enemy. so they might of thought that the game ended once the tutorial finished.

In terms of outside the length of the campaign, it's a live service game. I'm gonna expect more stuff to come in the future. hopefully in the form of free updates, with income generated from the marketplace instead of DLC. but for now, it is slightly limiting on unit choices, with only 8 standard units, excluding 'Super' units. but as with all RTS games. units are for purpose, rather than just to exist. so there might be no need for other units, as most RTS game's basic spam units are basically the same amount, going for upgrades or stronger units later to add diversity. It's not something you should care about if you're going into this for an RTS game.

I however have one issue with the game, that has the possibility of not being fixed, and that's the AI in this game. the AI is workable. but 'Stupid' you tell them to go attack a base across lava with a bridge beside you, they'll go into the lava unless the bridge is directly in front.

There's no 'Call all troops to follow you' button though. which, I can't decide whether it's a positive or a negative. Singleplayer, it's tedious and annoying. Multiplayer however, it allows for both players to micromanage an army as the other player can control the army that's not following you. the recall button on a spawner seems to only recall those not following others though. so in the middle of an attack move, your guys may vanish.

In summery, the game has a few faults. which are commonplace for RTS games, and will be manageable for those who actually play RTS games. So I'd totally recommend this game to those who do play RTS games.",1.0

Death can however be delayed by drinking the water of life from jugs hidden around ancient ruins.

4501,136968040.0,1976950,"Desktop Dungeons is a fun puzzle RPG played over small grid-based dungeons with trips back to town in between to refresh and plan the next adventure - think Darkest Dungeon. But instead of a consistent roster of characters making progress over many dungeon runs, each run begins with a Level 1 newb of a chosen Kin/Class combination.

The map starts out mostly hidden, with a mix of walls, monsters, and loot scattered throughout. Using your chosen character's unique skill combination, your goal is to navigate the semi-open floor plan dungeon in search of the boss monster. Monsters are static in nature - they stand in one spot and don't attack you unless you attack them, so you get to pick and choose the timing of your combats to maximize your experience. And maximize you will, as enemies are not bags of loot, but bags of precious experience needed to level up and reach a high enough level to face the boss monster in combat.

Sounds like a pretty standard RPG, so why is it a puzzle RPG? 

To start with there's basically never enough monsters in the map to attain maximum level just fighting fair. Monsters are worth more XP if they're above your level when you kill them, so you're incentivized to fight them early. But then you're also taking more damage as you go and there's limited healing items, so you're planning to hit those precious full-heal level ups as you go. 

Fortunately, every new map space you uncover grants you health and mana back. So you could punch the monster, then uncover some map to gain back health and mana ... but they'll get a chance to heal up too, so your attacks were less useful. Oh wait, but you could hit them a couple times, kill a really weak monster that pushes you over into a new level, get the full-heal, and THEN come back for round 2 with the big monster! Assuming you remembered to leave some weak monsters around - you did start planning which monsters you would prioritize killing first, right? Oh, and of course there's all this great treasure lying on the floor to make you stronger - but that means exploring into the fog, which will burn your precious chances to heal up later.

Ooo, wait, this spell I found turns a monster to stone so I don't get XP for it, but then it makes the next monster worth 50% more exp. So if I turn a Level 1 monster to stone and kill something big, I'll get more bonus exp for killing the big monster than I would get for killing them separately. And it'll also create a barrier that I can throw this other monster into for damage. And ...

Now you're really playing Desktop Dungeons.

It took a few hours for me to actually fall a decision:""Should I buy it, should I buy the Deluxe Edition or should I not buy it at all?""
I've purchased the Deluxe Edition. Some may call me crazy, some people are calling me crazy anyways, but that's a story for another day, anyways, where did I stop? Oh, right: Some people may call me crazy for spending 49,99€ for this game, and I totally understand why. As someone who started playing minecraft since Beta 1.5, who's still playing ""The Settlers 2: The Next Generation"", who played with castles as a child and joined a medival RP-PVE-PVP factions Minecraft Server in 2012, I can find joy in this game.

Of course, the game is young, has a few bugs that can make walls fly in the air for example and features the can let your place building on nether territory (destory the buildings (I forgot what they're called) that are meant to make the air more breathable for piglins and less for overworld inhabitants -> some blocks underneath it will change back into grass blocks where you can place towers for example), but exactly because it's young the game has still a lot of bugfix and content update potential.

I personally wished this game, and games in general were less expensive, because for many people that much money is a lot, some of use don't have jobs (yet), don't earn much money or have a lot of expenses. The current price is not really one a lot of people are willing to pay, especially with the option option of the ""Deluxe Edition"" is like 25% more expensive than its normal version and its main feature is to add one more character and a few more mount skins(?) to the game.

This leads to another for me controversial topic -> Skins and Microtransactions:
A really important, at least for me really important, feature of minecraft is the creation, upload and wearing of player skins. Skins help you to individualize your ingame representation, fuel creativity, make you feel more one with a game.
Sadly Minecraft Legends took a path of a list of player-skin-models you can select with not much liberty to customize your character. It has its reasons, like facial expressions of the characters and earning more money through minecoins and some of the characters are wearing pretty outfits (my fav. outfit is the green-brown one, since it reminds me about one of my main minecraft skins I've pixeled over seven years ago), but giving players to dress a character differently, combine, individualize even more, is something that would make the game more worth playing. This could be through a 3D-skin-upload, or even if just a character designer.

[Some text I wanted to write, but I forgot what I planned to write. Here some more things I've remembered in a list format:]
- It would be nice if we could give our game saves names.

I enjoy the game, but I wished there were more features, bug fixes, maybe even a feature to play as the piglins in multiplayer and that the game wouldn't cost that much.

I gave it a thumbs up and hope that price, etc. will change in the future.

[h1] Review [/h1]
Classic match 3 game with short stories of furry girls on the battle field, the gameplay is pretty standard, you just have to reach a certain score to advance to the next level, there are no modifiers or special items to make higher scores and no button to skip the level, there are 25 levels and 5 different girls for each 5 levels.
There is only one song in the game which is not bad but it ends up tiring to listen to it in all levels so it is advisable to mute the music in the game.
👄[b]sexual content[/b]
*You need to activate the free DLC
When activating the DLC, the option to undress the girl will be unlocked as you progress through her levels, the girl will lose her clothes unlocking short animations with slight movement up to the point of undressing her completely and ending in a short masturbation scene, these small scenes have a moan from the girl but this it's good but pretty generic.
The design of the girls is decent and varied, in terms of fetishes the truth is that there nothing more than the main scoop of furry girls.

💭[b]Conclusion[/b]
A game to exercise the dominant hand and that's it, the gameplay is quite generic as well as the sound effects of both the game and the girls, if you like furry girls it's a decent option since the mini-animations of the girls are good for the sale price, if there was a button to skip level it would be better to be able to enjoy the girls without having to pass all the levels.

4523,136968478.0,1308360,"I haven't been so disappointed in a while. The demo for Gun Jam was a highlight of 2022 for me, but the full release just falls completely flat and its a shame.

The linear ""checkpoint""-style levels with bespoke tracks tuned to the level timings (or so it felt anyways) got basically replaced by 3 arena-style levels that last way too long and just become boring. There is one checkpoint-style level left, but due to any song being playable on any level it doesnt have the tight feel of the demo anymore.

Another big thing is that it feels like the main tracks arent manually beatmapped anymore, the shots are way more sparse and they do not feel like they align with tracks too well, as if it is just auto-mapped the same way you can auto map your own tracks now (which is appreciated).

Its just such a letdown overall. The demo felt pretty tight in terms of rhythm, and the checkpoint style was the highlight, mixing fast navigation while shooting enemies to fit into every section on time, together with more open arenas that would come around during very fitting parts of the song.

The worst part is that you can see how it was in the 3rd steam trailer and judge for yourself.

The UI also somehow got a downgrade? While it can be treated as less intrusive - with everything glowing on screen - its harder to see  now that numbers dont have a backdrop, and instead are just floating white text on the screen.

There are also bugs, or what feels like bugs anyways. You can clear arenas without killing all the enemies somehow? The boss healthbars do not update, enemies get stuck on things and you can't find them sometimes. Also the gun sounds feel way undertuned and hard to hear. And the icons for beat types (single hit vs hold) arent clear or explained. There is also no tutorial whatsoever, even tho the demo at least showed controls on screen and provided basic objectives to get you started.

TL;DR This release of gunjam feels very undercooked, and just plain worse than the beta. I don't think I'm going to be refunding because i played the beta so much I feel like I got my fun out of it, but I dont think I'm going to be playing the main game until major changes are made",0.0

4527,136969895.0,2273470,"I can see where this is going but there's more to be done to make this ""fun"". Some points of frustration that ruined the fun for me

- Only paint brush size is very small, which means the painting takes a long time to complete
- Hold to select which part to assembly is quite a lengthy amount of time (3-4 seconds ish, this doesn't sound a lot individual until you realise the level of detail this goes to, i.e. each string, tuning knob, pick up, dial etc) 
- Having to select which variant of a part for each instance of that part ( combined with the above means adding all 6 strings means, long press down to select the string, picking the only correct one from the menu, selecting assembly complete, threading the string) repeat 6 times. 
- The spiral stairs are narrow and very bumpy, climbing them is quite tricky without falling off and is motion sickness inducing (in someone who doesn't get motion sick! )

This all said, the game was bug-free quite detailed and had a lot of features. Just needs some quality-of-life fixes to make this recommendable",0.0

i just want to say that the many tiny hidden details make this game so much more special to me personally, it's such a cute & wonderful roguelike. the audio & art design is masterfully done too and they contribute to the game's atmosphere so much -- i found myself spending more time taking in the environment around my little explorer instead of fighting, the general ambiance, the gems and the setting of the forest area really reminded me of those fun old school games you'd use to play having a CRT monitor hooked up and that got me so severely nostalgic - needless to say i'm going to be playing this for quite a bit. it's genuinely fun & extremely replayable!

my only criticism would be to make camera shake off by default as it makes the screen vibrate a lot and i think it subtracts from the already amazing experience that this is.

TLDR if you play games for fun, have a taste for small details and love pixel graphics, try this out and support one of the most passionate indie devs out there!

Some dialogue, particularly Sylas's dialogue can be jarring given previous incarnations of Sylas in lore, but this makes Sylas seem like more of a three-dimensional character and make him more relatable and fleshed out. 
Also there is little to no voice acting in the game and they reuse voice lines (mostly grunts, yells, and champion catchphrases) from League of Legends which is a little disappointing given how much voice acting there was in Ruined King, but the reused voice lines are well placed and serve to make champions more recognizable.
However i do not think it was a good decision to lock some spells behind a paywall, and while the spells are absolutely not necessary to complete the game nor are they overpowered and it personally doesn't bother me much, it is still very dumb to do in the first place.

I didn't get very far however because I couldn't even beat the tutorial. One of the first things you learn in this game is the gathering zone. You need to hold right click to select a zone and then while you're right clicking, click left click to confirm. I am playing on laptop so I can not hold right click and then left click while doing that. If I left click I attack and if I hold right click I highlight a zone.

It's one of THOSE remasters. You know the one. The head-scratcher. The unnecessary one. The ""What were they thinking??"".

Desktop Dungeons is a magnificent game. A puzzle roguelike for coffee breaks with simple yet smart game rules paired with clear visual design. Brilliant. The original game that is. 

This remaster on the other hand is a mystery. How can a team that created the original forgo charming and CLEAR visuals for a Hearthstone like cookie-cutter graphic style and an anti player UI? The monsters and items are small, the camera angled for some reason and all crucial information is scattered all over the screen seemingly at will. For a game that needs CLEAR information this re-imagining gets everything wrong. Just skim over a few other reviews (positive or negative) and you will see a common theme of UI issues. Fast and fun play sessions are turned into slow grinds against the interface.

And the developer knew about the game's quality and still went through with it. They even gave away this game for free to people that owned the original in an attempt to fish for positive reviews. Don't be fooled.

4600,136973656.0,1308360,"I can't believe i got hyped for a year just to end up hating this game. All I do in my regular life is: blast techno/synth music, and shoot guns in destiny and cod. I thought this game would be perfect for me, hell my NAME is even JAM. But what we have here is heartbreaking.

 The demo that came out several months before release was amazing! The music was somehow curated to line up perfectly with the timing of shooting enemies, as well as the traversal of the levels. You were able to feel yourself get faster and better as you improved and got further each time. The high beats when you were swarmed with enemies, the small lulls that allowed you to dash to the next area, it felt like it all made sense. Like when you first start out, you get slapped around a bit, you dont reach the time gates fast enough, and you need to learn. And as you learn, you started to feel how the timing of each area lined up perfectly with the songs, the amount of enemies in a given space, and how far you needed to traverse at any given time; when you practiced and improved, the flow just clicked in your mind and felt so good, even if it could be too challenging sometimes. All of that seems to be gone now.

So what happened with the full release? Why does it feel so bad?? 
To start, lets just get this out of the way; the music is phenomenal. Truly the crown achievement is the soundtrack. Unfortunately thats where it ends though. The graphics are not impressive, but we already knew thats not why we're here, so we can ignore that. The level design from the demo seems to have gone out the window. No more corridors or mazes to navigate, now its just 1 big room. This creates a new problem where you don't know where enemies are coming from anymore. Previously as long as you kept marching onward, you knew that enemies would come face you head-on. But now that you're just playing in a big room, you can get swarmed from all directions. This simply does not work for Gun Jam. There's no radar. There's no minimap. There isnt actually anything to allow you to gather info to fight back. Hell for a game all about audio, the 3D sound design is atrocious. You can't hear enemies around you at all, they barely make a sound, which is why changing the game from gauntlet-style corridors to just 1 big arena is so frustrating to me.

The other major issue I have with this game is the auto-mapping of the song beats; basically those colorful cues for when youre allowed to fire your gun. Yes ""allowed to"" because you literally cant deal damage off the beat of the song. And the flow of the beat? Completely random. No idea how the hell it ended up SO different than in the demo, but the timing of when youre allowed to shoot feels so wrong. For a few seconds you'll be firing to the beat of the backing drums, then maybe it will switch tempo to like the bass or lead vocals or something and just completely throws you off. Like come on, I'm still clicking to the beat of the drums back there, they didn't go anywhere, so why did you have to change it up on me? Why is it that in the demo it was able to seamlessly flow from slow to quick and back to slow shooting and it all made sense with the phrases of each song, but now it feels so random?? It just feels so bad when you are swarmed on all sides by enemies, but the game said you need to wait 2 seconds until the next note where we will allow you to shoot gun. bro i am not jamming.

Besides that, the weapons themselves are kinda bland. No visuals or sounds or effects that really stand out. Kinda sucks not having any control over your arsenal at all, apparently only the song may decided for you which gun youre allowed to shoot when. Oh are you surrounded by a hoard of small guys? shotgun or aoe blast sure would be nice, but we're just gonna give you this zapper you can tap once every second. Maybe this doesnt even matter at all since there is hardly any enemy variety. nothing but 'big guy who walks at you for melee' or 'small guy that walks at you for melee'. I remember the demo also had a couple flying guys and a large robo boss type but thats about it.

man it doesnt feel good at all to crap all over this game that i was so excited to play. i seriously considered refunding this, but because i love the music so much i just cant do that. this game showed so much potential in the demo that seems to be all  gone now. no more levels, no progression, no story even. its literally just 'insert coin to play arcade game for a few minutes'. if they were to just manually adjust the firing of the weapons to the specific beats of each song, and then make those flow into actual maps, this game would be amazing. it would make it feel like an actual curated, tight, lovingly crafted experience. but as it stands now, cannot recommend this game. I hope i need to come back and edit this review in the future.

Im gonna start with the things i liked since its a negative review (take into consideration that i didn't play through the whole game and just under 2h)

Pros:
I like the pixel artstyle and there are some pretty nice scenary in this game. I saw people complaining about controlls but i had pretty smooth experience on Steam Deck. The gameplay was good for me so far into the game i liked spell system and follower system where followers give you some combos and power boosts.
Cons:
The storytelling is really bad imo. when speaking with someone on supposedly important matter in your hideout the music in the background is relaxing and it feels out of place plus there is no voice acting to make it even slightly better. Conversations felt really bland, maybe its me but i really expected dialogs to be much more serious and smart than whimsical and overall feel of the story does not seem natural to me. Level design is not very good but i guess it's limited because its liner. There are spells locked behind paid DLC content which is crazy to me but whatever.

I just couldn't justfy 30€ pricepoint and that is the main reason why i refunded this game. I will probably buy this game again when it's on at least 50% discount. I love league of legends universe and i liked Moonlighter but this game disappointed me.

4633,136978163.0,1967630,"I was not a fan of the GUI / UX in this game. Everything felt very artificial - e.g. collecting palm leaves by pressing E when staring at the trunk to pop-up a container-like view, selecting the leaves I wanted, and then pressing ""collect"". I didn't feel immersed in the environment at all. I also didn't love the awkwardness of pressing RMB to start throwing a spear, then RMB to put it away, but LMB to actually throw it.

I want to address the badger combat that a few other reviewers have complained about.
I think the problem with the combat is two-fold.

1. It seems like the player's block is very slow, like pressing RMB has a delayed reaction / the actual block occurs a non-negligible amount of time afterwards. This applies also to the attack.
2. It didn't seem like the badger had any telegraphing before the attack, so as a player it felt like I was just pressing RMB at an arbitrary moment in time in order to block the attack that would come later.

The combination of those two factors made the combat feel clunky and non-responsive. That could be addressed by tightening up player animations (make them much more responsive) and making sure enemies have a clear ""pause"" period before their actual attack so that the player can recognize and block at that exact moment.",0.0

Puerto Rico 1513 in search of the fabled fountain of youth you shipwreck on some islands.  Can you survive long enough to find any surviving crew-mates?  Will you live to find the fountain of youth?

Early Access launched today and this game downloaded, installed and booted without issue.  Plays great and feels polished up to the end of the ""tutorial"" story driven quest line.  Excited to see what's next!

Overall:
Definitely worth a look if you like survival games and early access communities here on Steam!  Devs seem to have already put in plenty of work for an Early Access game so I imagine they will continue their efforts while polishing and support this game through to it's full release!

4635,136977160.0,1967630,"Ive played quite a few survival crafters and feel i have a good base line to compare to.

Thus far, this one needs some work. 

The harvesting is quite bland with no animations, just a pop up screen.
The crafting UI is pretty terrible and un-intuitive.
The durability on items is ridiculously low, almost 1 shot use.
The progression of crafting tech doesnt seem particularly streamlined.
Item quantity requirements feel really high in comparison to low harvested items. 
Map shows icons where ""resources"" are - loses a bit of immersion.
Resources have recharge times listed meaning static spawns which is just meh.

I was hoping for a mix of green hell / icarus but at the moment this game is way off. Great concept just not particularly well implemented.

Everything seems laborious, from killing to crafting to harvesting - and not in a fun way.
General gameplay wise, it got boring quite quickly - plugged away to try and do more but its just...dull.

Worst part: You cant harvest whilst being hunted by an animal. (The hunted animal was a snake 10 metres away just looking at me....just meh)

4696,118898313.0,1679290,"3 hours on the first day of release and I can say? Very good first impression. 

Notable +

* Simultanious turn based games feel strategic like a turn based game without reactionary - as you need to predice your opponents moves in real time - but you don't wait for your opponent to make their turn, as you fill out your orders for the first time.

* Free? More than capable of being a £10-£15 steam game given its current form and status. Again, still under development too.

* Nation diversity is a A* for me, at least from a eurocentric perspective. With plans to release nations from elsewhere, however, I dont feel confident criticising this just yet. But for now, you have plenty of EUROPEAN nations to play - mostly great powers. 

* Regiment uniquness. Want to play an Austria with only Hungarian regiments? Go for it. Germany with only bavarian regiments? GO FOR IT. Great Britain with only Scottish troops? We got you. Also Highlanders are just awesome to use 10/10 love firing twice.

* Perks?  Simple and easy to understand, along with the combat. +1 range, +1 attack order, +1 manuever order. Simple, thank god.

Notable - 

I feel bad putting anything here, seeing as it is expected given it's a free, unfinished (still in development) game. 

* Bugs? Yeah, it has them. Nothing UI related, so it should be playable at all times. At the moment of this comment, I have noticed 2, both within quick play mode. Auto selecting your nation and troops for a battle, only sometimes what you last used, and being stuck in the loading screen.

Bosorka is a new roguelike, which can give you fun, but with some nuances.

- First, the witch is flying on a broom, and controlling it feels smooth and pleasant. You can both dash and sprint, and the impact gives a nice addition to the control.
- Secondly, the overall battle system is dynamic and decent. Enemies' patterns are not unique, but battles require using your mobility and spells as much as possible. It was also a good discovery that the dash can be used to stun enemies, making it a part of your usual tactics. As a roguelike, the game provides you with different spells and amulets (even different types of brooms) that could be unlocked during the walkthrough.
- Thirdly, levels have their unique visual themes and have a variety of transition principles. E.g. one level will require you to fly over the water (while the stamina level for movement reduces over time), and another will make you use the wind streams to fly into the air to reach the distant islands. 

Meanwhile, you have to keep in mind some issues before start playing: 
 - There's not a big variety of all content - bosses, levels, spells, amulets, and so on. As a result, you can unlock most of the closed content in 4-5 hours, and that's all that the game can offer you. Moreover, more variety in build creation would be great. Some spells and amulets are stronger than others.
- It also would be great to have a more unique style, as some enemies are not visually memorable.

However, if you'd like to play not a long roguelike, which not requires to have a wiki guide on the other page, Bosorka could be a nice choice for some hours of catchy gameplay!",1.0

Instead of building wood or even metal bases, just have it to where people can just make a random house there own with a couple modification / upgrades. My idea for this would be to have a way to craft doors with key locks on them. Door can either be metal or wood (metal having more HP.) You destroy the existing door and place you key lock door. This could be used for front and back doors but also rooms inside the house. Making it possible for players to have secure loot rooms inside their house. Doors are already able to be destroyed so placing your own would be perfect. As for the windows, harvest wood and crafts boards to board up the house windows from inside only. Not only wood but maybe have metal for an upgrade option.  Players can destroy the boards from the outside to raid others homes. I don't know yet what raiding weapon could fit in the game yet. C4 could be an option. or just shooting guns to break things too. Storage boxes would also have to be an basic craft-able item too. using wood and key lock (or locking mechanic) like the door would be an easy route to implement boxes.",1.0

and now onto the short review

[h1]TL;DR Review[/h1]




//intro//

Welcome back comrades, this is MF Kraven & you are watching less than 10 mins reviews. The Youtube series where I take a look at games i think seem cool & give my thoughts on them in less than 10 mins.


Today I take a look at Pet's Hotel, a business sim game about running a hotel for Pets. But can the formula of owning and running a hotel for pets be a viable business plan or will it be doomed to fail? Let's find out.



//Graphics, Sound & Artstyle//

Starting off with graphics, I can say I appreciate what they're going for, and some of the animals look absolutely adorable- and maybe it's because I don't like the look of certains breeds.. but some are straight out of uncanny valley.That being said, for what this game is- it is aesthetically pleasing. Only real gripe i have with sound is that it's not memorble and what is, (the ringtones, is annoying) 


//Gameplay//

There are three game modes to choose from, while only two are shown- sandbox mode to me should be a thing of it's own. You start by entering your Pet Hotel & answering phone calls to see if customers can make reservations for their trusty companions. If room is available you register their pet's name, the amount of days they will be staying and if they choose any extra services like nail clipping. You then wait for the next day to check that pet in and take em to their room- the animal in question will have certain bars that you can check to see what their needs are. Food, Water, attention, potty time, etc. Some animals will have preferences to what food they like or dont like as well as allergies so be wary of that as well.

Challenge mode pits you into a scenario where times a ticking, you have a certain amount of days before you close down. So try and complete the objectives given to you to save the resort! A few of em dont have any holding rooms for pets so it's up to you what goes where.


Free Mode, sets you up in a building with a few rooms and tosses you right into the fire. a few holding rooms for your customers, and ready to be booked and cared for.

Sandbox mode puts you into a freemode map but allows you to construct at your hearts desire with no penalty on cash, of course achievements are also locked during this game mode, just in case for those who like that sort of thing. aka people like me


//Price//

 17.99 USD


//How many hours estimated//

Well over 20 hours of fun can be had in this. My estimation.


//Final Thoughts//


Rejoice owners of Nintendogs because this to me is a spiritual successor to that formula. Yes it's part business sim but also part playing with pets. Having to feed them, play with them, pet them. It actually works amazingly with the SteamDeck touchpad. You'll be rubbing good boy's bellies in no time, and damn the people who made me feel ashamed of playing with a Nintendogs, sure I was 14 and ccouldve been playing other games but i digress.

Pets Hotel is a cutesy management game, with no real objective other than to have a good time with your guests. But that novelty seems to run out pretty quick, as in the day to day tasks, when you have a few pets- time seems to go real slow, so when you speed a day up, well you're met with pets with depleted bars in the morning. But if you have too many pets in your hotel, you cant possibly reach em all. WHERE another gameplay mechanic comes into play, hiring employees to both run the front desk and help with pets can be available but the addition of this feature makes me wish this was multiplayer. How awesome would it be to run a Pet Hotel with a friend? Expand your resort, start charging a little more but keep giving the same mediocre attention to pets cause, how are they gonna tell?

I am having a good amount of fun, I just wish there was more happening or time went by a bit faster. There's no real penalty for letting a dog go poop in their room so there's no real incentive on taking em out to the backyard to let em make their business. Cant force the cat being picked up in an hour to drink some water even though his meter is low and I understand this may be by design, but in challenge mode- sometimes good reviews matter, and after having Stryker in my care for 7 days, always in the green to go home in an Orange meter because of that, sucks.


I hate how slow the NPC's move too. And that damn, phone, nonstop ringing. FORTUNATELY you can mute the phone, but i find that just going to your management computer and setting certain availability off is the best. And that's kind of why I hate hiring people, let's say that (25 mins in) Aero is being picked up so we have an availabilty- however because technically the room is being taken up, the day prior i couldn't take anymore dogs, but I still did it anyways- see I figured okay Aero will be picked up, as soon as i give him back I can quickly register from my notes Hank the dog, then take him in. That way I have my room booked up for the day, because for whatever reason people make a reservation for their pets a day ahead of time and always come the following day. Instead of a ""hey im gonna drop my dog off today for 6 days, do you have any spots?"" 



Little bits and details that I'm sure the devs might iron out in the future. In any case, with all these little gripes i have, I can still say whole heartdly you will have a great time if either pet care or business sims are your thing. Don't expect a deep game, just expect a cozy little sim game where you rub good boys bellies.

I was disappointed when GL announced his ""free"" game was going to be paid for the 1st year, that is a cheap shot considering they always said this was going to be F2P at release. But after giving it some thought and playing the beta back in June 2022, I realized this is money well spent, since I highly enjoy this title and I know as a fact that this will give me hours and hours of fun. So I got this just as a thank you for the developers.

Also, I'll make it clear, you can get all characters, car parts and crews FOR FREE in-game. Everything in-game is free, except for the premium season tiers (you get 2 seasons for free in the standard pack), but even those tiers you can get for free by farming loot boxes which can be purchased FOR FREE with in-game currency.

4728,136980034.0,1457080,"So there is a bug going on. If you return to your rebell camp during a Mission you loose every Resource you got, including Recruits (that part is probably intended). BUT The real Problem is here: For the game you already oponend all the chests and recruited all the Rebels, so you can't do it anymore. So after you returned to rebell camp you can enter an emptyed mission, where you cannot get resources from chests or recruit rebels. So which means with this Option alone you can brick your game totaly. 
This Game is so much fun. I have two ideas for a Solution:
* return to base camp actually lets you keep everything from chests and your Rebels but resets everything you got from fights. This would be the easiest solution and would turn a bug into a feature. Also the Feature would make sense that way in the first Place because for my Second Idea this Feature just feels senseless:
* return to base camp resets everything to before you actually started the mission (this is probably how this is supposed to work). -> As I said I think this would just make the whole option useless since you got no new resources to spend on anything just ending up restarting from new which no Player ever wants.",0.0

4730,136980045.0,1928870,"[b]Kiedy[/b] zapowiedziano [u]Minecraft Legends[/u], chyba mało kto z nas zgadł, czym ten projekt będzie. Enigmatyczny trailer, na którym ""kafelkowy"" bohater jedzie na koniu, ciągnąc za sobą armię minionów, sugerował strategię, ale przecież nie mamy tutaj typowego rzutu z lotu ptaka. Ostatecznie wyszło z tego coś, co łączy nieco Mount & Blade ze stareńkim Sacrifice, w którym strategiczne pole bitwy oglądaliśmy z perspektywy jednostki biorącej udział w walce.

[u]Podobnie jest i tutaj[/u] – gromadzimy armię, wydajemy jej proste polecenia, przejmujemy różne przyczółki wroga i po prostu ratujemy krainę przed świniopodobnymi Piglinami. Brzmi spoko? I takie w rzeczywistości jest, ale gra ma jeden, dość istotny problem. Przez niską złożoność i dużą powtarzalność, błyskawicznie staje się monotonna. Rzecz w tym, że dla pewnej grupy osób może to być duży plus.

Musicie wiedzieć, że nie jestem jakimś wielkim fanem Minecrafta — grałem trochę przed laty, ale nigdy nie doszedłem do późnego etapu rozgrywki. Nie przeszkadza to jednak w ogóle w odbiorze Legends. Choć podobnie jak w pierwowzorze, przenosimy się tutaj na proceduralnie generowaną, otwartą mapę, to nie możemy jej nijak modyfikować, kopać w ziemi. Wszystko dzieje się tu na powierzchni, a budowanie ogranicza się do stawiania budowli z gotowych już schematów — murów, wież obronnych, czy też ulepszeń dla naszej kompanii. Do tego wszystkiego oczywiście potrzebujemy surowców, ale ich gromadzenie odbywa się poprzez stawianie swoistych zbieraczy – drewna, kamienia, a później też węgla, czerwonitu czy złota lub diamentów. Wraz z progresem w rozgrywce odblokowujemy możliwość zbierania kolejnych surowców, ale też ulepszenia związane z tym, ile maksymalnie takich ""surków"" można unieść. I to w zasadzie tyle, jeśli chodzi o system rozwoju postaci w grze – nie ma tu tradycyjnych ""punktów ekspa"". Cały rozwój opiera się po prostu o zbieranie materiałów, a potem stawianie budynków, które wprowadzają ulepszenia naszego wyposażenia.

Nasza postać porusza się na koniu i może wyprowadzać ataki mieczem, ale nie są one tak skuteczne, jak możliwości armii naszych minionów. Te przywołujemy, stawiając specjalne spawnery (tak też przetłumaczono to w polskiej wersji gry) i to niemal bez ograniczeń liczbowych na mapie. Nic nie stoi więc na przeszkodzie, by postawić je sobie tuż przed bazą wroga, a kiedy przeciwnik okaże się za silny, odejść kawałek poza jego teren i przywołać jednostki. Płacimy za to surowcami, ale na tyle niedużo, że nigdy specjalnie nie będziecie zwracać na to uwagi.

[b]Zbyt łatwo, zbyt powtarzalnie[/b]
I tu objawia się pierwszy poważny problem [u]Minecraft Legends[/u] – bardzo niski poziom skomplikowania. Choć gra zaleca, by Portale Piglinów atakować dopiero po rozszerzeniu naszych możliwości bojowych, to nic nie stoi na przeszkodzie, by bazową grupą wparować do bazy, wysłać wszystkich ""na hejnał"", na Portal, z pominięciem wszystkich innych budynków wroga i po prostu odradzać zabite miniony w pobliskim spawnerze. Owszem, jeśli zniszczymy bazę po kolei, jak bóg przykazał, pewnie pójdzie nam łatwiej, ale po co?

Co jakiś czas Pigliny atakują też w nocy zajęte przez nas wioski, przez co trzeba się na taki atak przygotować, budując szeroko pojęte umocnienia. Daje to trochę zabawy, ale nie nastawiajcie się na złożone budowanie baz. Ot, dookoła stawiacie ogrodzenia, kilka wież, jakiś warsztat, który później automatycznie naprawi zniszczenia i to tyle. Nie jest to rozwiązane, jak w typowej strategii, w której budujecie jedną, centralną bazę wypadową z kolejnymi budynkami. Tutaj jesteście raczej takim ruchomym obozem, który umocnienia stawia tam, gdzie są potrzebne.

W gruncie rzeczy w to wszystko gra się bardzo przyjemnie – produkcja ma super ""feeling"", sterowanie jednostkami zarówno na klawiaturze, jak i na padzie jest intuicyjne, a grafika oszałamia cel-shadingowym stylem. Niestety, to wszystko niejako blednie przy bardzo szybko wkradającej się monotonii. Po pierwszych samouczkach wychodzi na jaw, że cała zabawa polega na czyszczeniu kolejnych obozów, za co zbieramy specjalny kluczowy dla ulepszeń surowiec, stawiamy ulepszenia, czyścimy kolejne przyczółki, zbieramy jeszcze więcej surowców... i tak w kółko.

Trzeba jednak zaznaczyć, że wyraźnie jest to produkcja nie tyle ""do przejścia"", co ""do pogrania"". Widać, że niczym w Minecraft, Mojang chciało stworzyć grę, w której siadacie ze znajomymi, wspólnie realizujecie powtarzalne cele, ale te są tylko tłem do tego, byście mogli sobie po prostu pograć i spędzić czas razem. Czy inaczej jest w Minecraft? No właśnie.

Inna sprawa, że tytuł dostał też tryb PVP, w który z racji grania przed premierą, udało mi się sprawdzić tylko raz, a i to w środku trwania rozgrywki. Jest potencjał, szczególnie gdy gra czterech na czterech, ale w tego typu grze wymagane jest zgranie — każdy musi zajmować się nieco czymś innym, aby wspólnie zdobyć jak najwięcej ulepszeń przed przeciwnikiem i zniszczyć jego przyczółki. W grze nie ma czatu tekstowego i głosowego (co zrozumiałe — chodzi o ochronę dzieci), zatem bez zgranej ekipy lepiej tego w ogóle nie tykać.

Jednakże jest szansa, że wasi znajomi tę grę mają, bo opłacają Game Passa. W takim układzie warto jej dać szansę, zwłaszcza jeśli szukacie czegoś, co po prostu pozwoli wam posiedzieć i pogadać przy jakiejś grze. To bardzo casualowa zabawa.

4731,136979998.0,1928870,"Upon starting up Minecraft Legends, I was immediately struck by the enjoyable and engaging gameplay of this real-time strategy game set in the beloved world of Minecraft. The introductory cinematic pulls you right into the action, as the player must take on the role of a hero tasked with stopping a piglin invasion in worlds lacking their own protectors. With the aid of golems and various mobs, players are able to mount a defense against the invading piglins. However, I did find myself struggling with the controls - particularly when using a mouse and keyboard - which felt disorienting and difficult to manage at times. Even when utilizing banner commands, I found it challenging to control the individual units effectively.

Despite these issues, the true strength of Minecraft Legends lies in its engaging storyline and immersive setting. The game effortlessly transports players into a rich and detailed world, filled with exploration and discovery. The addition of mounts adds an extra layer of excitement to the gameplay, making it all the more disappointing that some cosmetic features are locked behind a pay wall. It feels somewhat at odds with the game's promotion of creativity and exploration, and may leave some players feeling frustrated.

Moons Of Darsalon is probably one of the most vibrant homage ever made to games on old computers from the 80/90s (damn this CPC464-like loading screen is just AMAZING and brought back tons of memories). You ll immediately remember games such as Lemmings while playing it.

Trying to rescue your colleagues moving them to the closest base station using the many tools (weapons, flashlight, jetpack, plateform builder, vehicles, etc) and voice commands offered to the player ll prove challenging but never unfair. This thanks to Moons of Darsalon smart level design that ll challenge you while not turning frustrating because of poor controls or badly tuned puzzles.

Also the game has an external level creator tool available on the game Discord server to make your very own stages and share them to challenge other Moons of Darsalon players. This single feature should offer the game a virtualy infinite lifespan for as long as people ll release their very own creations.

Visualy speaking this is one of the most accurate retro looking game that i have ever seen when it comes to mimiccing games from the Amiga/Atari ST or early PC era. Its screen filter offers both the CRT and VHS-like vibe. Also all filters are individualy activable, good job!

Last but not least Moons of Darsalan chiptune soundtrack is just INCREDIBLE. The game catches absolutely everything from musics and sound Fx of old computers. Needless to say that the soundtrack is a MUST BUY even if you don't plan to play the game for as long as you enjoy chiptune music!

[h2]So all in all Moons of Darsalan is an incredible suprise to me and probably one of the best if not the best homage to computer games of the 80/90s ever released. So don't hesitate a single second, this game is a gem![/h2]",1.0

4768,136981346.0,1976950,"Desktop Dungeons is a great and unique game. I'm less sure whether this version is worth playing over the original. This version has a few notable improvements - like dungeons aspect ratios being much better for contemporary screen resolutions; and better combat predictions so there's less (or no?) risk of dying in combat for a reason you don't necessarily understand, which happened occasionally in the original (e.g. maybe some status effect was applied mid-combat). There's also been some very slight rebalancing; the number of such changes can be counted with one hand, which is fine in what's essentially a remastered game.

I also appreciated that I was able to port my save files from the original over to the remastered version.

The overall new presentation and UI is more of a mixed bag. Top-down is just a better perspective for a turn-based puzzle game than this isometric perspective, where one must occasionally scroll to see all enemies. And I just don't understand why the health UI has player stats in the top left and enemy stats in the top right: the single most important thing in the game is to be able to tell at a glance whether you can kill a monster or not, and this is not possible here; instead you must constantly glance into either corner to compare what will happen to both you and the monster.

A remaster is the perfect opportunity for genuine UI innovation, and the actual UI falls far short of its potential. Here it sometimes feels more like you're fighting the UI, rather than benefiting from it.

I would consider it a bit pricey considering 100%ing the game should take no more than 15 hours but it was still really fun overall.

With that said, the game REALLY could have used voice acting. It felt kind of dry with just text showing up on your screen that you have to read. The Ruined King felt so much more alive because of the fact that it implemented voice acting.

Also the cutscene skipping is fraudulent and barely speeds it up at all so if you die in a boss fight and start it up again, you have to watch the entire thing before you can get on with the action.

Also while not something that ruined the experience, the progression tracker is a straight up lie.

4804,136983256.0,1457080,"I have finished the game in its entirety on Kingslayer Difficulty (Hardest Difficulty), only missing 3 achievements that i will end up getting eventually. Here's My Review.

As for the game generally:

This game is amazing. From start to finish, the game keeps you intrigued and invested in the characters of Sylas, Garen, Lux and any others you meet down the line, as they all have a place in the story, as well as a job that they all do extremely well. This game takes place just after the events of Lux stopping Sylas' live execution (known info) and fills in a part of Demacia's lore that has been left out for quite some time now, so everything in this game is such a joy and wonder to discover as you play through. The writing and direction with the game is also really good, depicting characters really well in every situation they're in. The game is also surprisingly smooth, fast, and looks incredible, and the Combat only makes the game smoother, faster, greater. 

Combat, Controls, etc:
The game at the start is rather simple. Introductions of a light and heavy attack as every game does. Although, some people may find that there are an overwhelming amount of controls (at least on controller, nearly every button has a use). However,  there is no such scenario where you HAVE to use ALL buttons. I went through the game using only 3-5 buttons anyway. The game also allows you to make your own combat style through the Outlaws, who are practically Assists that give you 1 special move u can use anytime through the use of a couple inputs such as Light, Light, Heavy as an example. Once you get a grasp of the buttons and mechanics, the game only gets Faster and more enjoyable with each kill on an enemy, as you start chaining from enemy to enemy with speed, dealing massive damage along the way. And even combining your moveset with the ability to steal Magic Abilities and use your own ones allows for even more creativity in the way you play. 

Lore-wise:
Yes, the game has a lot of good little callbacks, mentions and even new stuff. For you lore nerds out there, there is A LOT to discover here i feel. Some stuff about Noxus and Freljord, not in the main story but stuff that you can find if you look around, be prepared to read though.

Now, I will say that the game does have a couple underlying bugs at the moment, only 1 of them affecting my gameplay:
Firstly, as rare as this one is, occasionally an enemy just won't die. You still progress as normal, as the next area will open upon depleting it's health bar, but it will just refuse to die. Just continue on and ignore it.

Secondly, this one is rather common i think, as it happened to me on all my attempts with a specific boss, but the bosses health bar would be depleted and the level wouldn't progress for another 15-20 seconds at least. It does end up progressing normally, but ur kinda forced to wait for the game to realise that u actually won the fight. 
Thats really the only 2 main bugs I ran into. Other ones are slight UI bugs that are just not an issue.

Unlock system:
You are able to spend the same currency on Everything here. The game doesn't throw a bunch of different currencies at you like Gems or Crystals, rare separate currencies, none of that. This currency is able to be used for new Spells and Upgrades for Sylas, being stuff like Damage or Health upgrades for example. Very simple system here, and it works just fine. 

Campaign Content and Replayability:
Aside from having the usual Campaign missions, there are also Secondary missions you can complete for extra rewards and extra fun. You can do these secondary ones at basically any time you see fit. 
There is a character that provides the ability to replay every mission you've done.
The Replayability here is really just to get stuff you haven't gotten or found in previous missions (which there will likely be a good handful of stuff you miss), but outside of that, unless u just feel like playing the game again, there isn't much.

That being said, it isn't nearly long enough.  8.3 hours to beat the campaign on normal, and once you beat the boss, there is literally nothing to do.  No more bad guys, no reason to defend villages. Worse more, there is nothing to show for my completion for PVE or PVP.  There is nothing to grind for, nothing to build towards.  There is no real replayability in the game. Once I beat it again on legend for the rest of my achievements, I might uninstall as I will have absolutely nothing left to do.

4812,136983112.0,1308360,"I clicked that I recommend this game [AT FIRST, READ EDIT BELOW], but only if you have a niche. 

I have been looking for a fast-paced shooter a-la Ultrakill that felt unique and challenging with a high skill ceiling. This is absolutely it. Self-paced challenges combined with the structure of a rhythm game in the FPS genre feels like an M rated Rhythm Heaven Fever. 

The music feels awesome, and massive plus there's an option for custom songs. I haven't tried it yet, but I'm excited to see if the dev allows for public mods or a workshop to share custom levels or tracks like Beat Saber did. 

While there aren't levels, the fact an update was released mere hours after launch indicates that there is hope for more content on the way. 

Right now it feels barebones, but the premise is fantastic and I will play the game far beyond my ""$1=1 hour"" rule.

SUGGESTIONS: 
1. More distinctive graphics. Everything looks bright and it can be hard to focus on what I just shot or who I killed.
2. Workshop support: Probably a long-time project and there are better things to work on right now, but it would be awesome.
3. Campaign. Don't need a story, but some pre-built levels would add an astounding amount of content.



EDIT

After playing for a bit more I can tell that the songs are not lined up to the beats, or maybe the beats aren't aligned consistently to the song. Either way it just seems like I'm playing a timing game with only visual cues. That definitely needs fixing.

Also the algorithm for inserted music could use some work. I'm willing to supply my song copies as base but they seem too quiet. Not to mention the same beat alignment issue is here, but it's excusable in this instance since it's trying to place beats according to what seems like waveform spikes alone.


Okay, finally refunding the game. The beats being off, timing screwy, did anything from the demo make it to the final product? Will they?",0.0

The foundation of the game is fun, i really like it, however it could have some improvements.

The difficulty increasing overtime its terribly executed, making enemies just faster, strong and spawn alot more
I think the difficulty should slightly buff normal zombies and instead make new unique enemies spawn.

The bosses are just extremely generic and doesn't fit into the game at all, they fucking use a shotgun and fly, its a literal fantasy.

They should straight up remove the bosses in their current state, and they should completely rework or remove the current ones.
Make them fit in with the world, instead of making them spawn in fixated areas in the map.

Desktop Dungeons: Rewind, like its predecessor, is like a puzzle game in a way. You have to throw yourself, gear, and your glyphs (magic) at the right enemies for your level in the right order to kill without dying, regen by exploring fog of war squares, then do the same to the next enemy until you !SPROING! level up and auto-fill hp/mp making yourself stronger and able to more easily tackle enemies.

Each run is a procedurally generated map and, if you win or escape with your life, you gain some money. You use that to upgrade your village which gets you new classes like Fighter, Wizard, etc, or species/races like Human, Elf, Dwarf, etc. and a couple other things.

4836,136985081.0,1976950,"Desktop Dungeons: Rewind.

It's an... alright game.

Not great, not horrible, just alright.

The game play itself is the same  puzzle RPG mechanics from the original game presented in 3D. It feels pretty good & seems to be mostly bug free. The update to graphics, such as the 3D & wide screen support & general supporting of a modern Windows system is done well.

The main thing that makes the game play a bit annoying is the forced tutorial type stuff that keeps popping up.
Maybe it's because it's been some time since I started a new game in the original product but Rewind feels like it has more of the tutorial/forced moves & that said mechanics take more clicking to get through.

Over all it's a small thing to the game play & is eventually over leading to the ability to play nice short dungeons almost infinitely.

However what drags the game down is its lack of accessibility & 'quality of life' options. For instance there's no colour blind settings, no key binding options or even a key list, no pausing the game on focus loss,  no GUI/UX options, etc.
For instance... 'E' does something but I'm not sure what yet.. I suspect it's the last spell used but I randomly hit 'E"" while playing to  get my only spell's 'spell ready' prompt.
It's sure be nice to see what keys the game accepts instead of randomly hitting something & have the game act on it.
Another example is inability to to change how the camera is operating; I prefer to have the PC in the upper right hand corner & will initiate actions while already 'scouting ahead' on the map... only for the camera to put the PC centre screen & no option to change this behaviour.

Over all I don't feel the game deserves a 'great' or a 'horrible'; I feel the game is 'alright' but Steam's review system is either a 'yes' or a 'no' thumbs up or down system. And then there's the 'owners of the original game get Rewind for free'.
That's a good move by the developers/publishers & a rare 'players matter' move... but it also feels very much like they're trying to 'buy votes'.
Now... do I need to mark my review as 'received for free' as I own the original game? I don't know & am unclear on Valve's rules on such things.

So I'm going for what I hope is the more reasonable road... I'm down voting the game despite thinking it's alright because I'm intending it as an attempt to even out all the positive votes to make the [u]overall rating[/u] a more neutral rating.
I'm also not marking my review as 'received for free' as I did, at one time, spend $ on the game... I bought the original at full price several years ago.",0.0

    [*] Bosses are well designed and challenging; every scenario feels unique and offers new challenges.
    [*] Stealing spells is pretty fun, but choosing combos is a welcomed addition I was not expecting. It's a perfect mix of bullet hell and beat-em-up games.
    [*] Fun ways of interacting with the environment to find secrets without it feeling too random. 
    [*] Music is incredible and the sound effects really add to the immersion.
    [*] Good story... Though it's also a con with he enemies you fight. 
    [*] Garen kicks butt.

Cons:

    [*] Demacia is anti-mage... but you steal spells from mages that are fighting for Demacia.... WHAT?
    [*] Game is extremely short. Like, insultingly short. 
    [*] The spells available are underwhelming and few, yet they have the nerve to have interesting spells that you need to PAY for. for $30 bucks you deserve to have full access to cool stuff in a short experience like this at LEAST. 
    [*] Slow-mo is a little repetitive when getting hit, and there is no options to skip cutscenes. So when you fail a bossfight, you get to re-watch a long animation just to fight again. I guess it's motivation to not mess up?
    [*] There's no skipping into-splash? I would prefer to just get into the game and not spend two minutes waiting every time i boot it up. 
    [*] The buffer is a little extreme for my taste, don't miss-click or fat finger. You will be punished. 
    [*] Seriously wait for this game to go on sale. It's good, but nothing incredible and shorter compared to most games in the genre.

First impression in the first ten seconds was like wow, didn't expect gfx this decent, and wow wasn't expecting those sfx and atmospheric effects, I'm loving LITERALLY every detail so far WHILE trying to punch holes in it sadistically without real cause. sfx especially good, nice chill atmospherics and unique construction camera shake.

3/2/2058 - When you watch most game videos, or in the first days of release there can be a major lack of video, and I penny pinch scrooge-like with video games. Anyway point is the videos don't do the game justice, my only complaint after mission 1 is the zoom levels are restrictive (for me personally) and the mouse camera movement had to be adjusted down to 50%.

4844,136985120.0,1928870,"I'll start this with the minor issues I have with the game. 

  I experienced some pretty interesting wait times when loading my campaign in, I decided to time it and it took about 3 minutes and 10 seconds. I understand it's probably trying to load the world in but it is just something that threw me off especially because I know that wait will extend to longer at times (I think at one point I waited 20 minutes staring at the loading screen). 

  I also experienced a minor glitch twice where it put my character in a different position then where I was, once was on top of a wall and another when putting me on the opposite side of the wall. 

  Other than those things I really enjoyed the game and my experience so far. It's a pretty simple game in which I can sit and sink my time into it. If you are annoyed by in game currencies it does have minecoins, however it's mainly for cosmetics. Overall I enjoy it so far and I think it's one if you have the time in interest for it, I'd recommend",1.0
4845,136985040.0,1928870,"A lousy cash grab Microsoft forced upon their employees, immediately upon starting the game the controls feel dreadful and the concepts feel downright insulting- it's watered-down Minecraft while stuck to a horse. Instead of collecting these resources and building structures yourself, have allays do it for you! Meanwhile, the only engaging aspect is the combat, which is remarkably shallow. Real time strategy without the strategy, essentially. I just spammed towers and sat still, and the spawners I could build felt really awkward because I could just spam allies out of them (allies that struggle with path finding it seemed lol), which clumsily assisted in mowing down the equally clumsy and mindless enemies while I attempt to assist by spamming the one attack button they give me. I finally gave up when I was sent to take care of the night beacon- required to progress- and the game had the fucking audacity to spawn the fortress in the MIDDLE OF A LAKE. I could not build a bridge- it was too far. I had to get lucky with one skeleton destroying two polluters and barely having grass to make a cobblestone golem generator on the main island, so I did. I had to leave and return multiple times for resources to tank through the endless piglins. I couldn't bring any mobs over from the outside because they refused to move through the lava surrounding the fortress, which was awkwardly coexisting with water just fine. Once I finally thought I was getting somewhere, I realized I couldn't destroy the walls protecting the portal. I was clever enough to jump over it, but the player character cannot destroy structures so there was no amount of tenacity I could have had to actually complete this mission. I couldn't bring creepers past the lava moat and I needed them to destroy the wall to bring the other units in to destroy the portal- it was impossible and the world was softlocked.

The artstyle I personally hate, the half-and-half of the classic sharp edges and ugly cut corners feels very bothersome, and the cel shading job they did looks awful. I feel like it just really badly wanted to look unique from the vanilla game like Dungeons did (Dungeons' artstyle I thought was very cool) but they couldn't think of any ideas. This last visual point feels awkward to talk about, but the playable characters they present at the beginning provoked an interesting response from me when I started. They were all effeminate save for maybe one design that could maybe go either way and another design that was totally ambiguous because of the mask they were wearing. Considering Mojang's recent focus on representation and inclusivity, I was surprised because I didn't feel represented at all as a man.

I've seen the story before the game launched on Youtube through an ""All Cutscenes"" type of video. The story's dog water- especially the literal Mark of Cain plot point they've got going for the origin of the Illagers. The god characters turn a group of villagers that choose to fight for their world grey and violent and that's just supposed to make sense. They fight the battle but now they're evil after the game's story closes- doesn't bear any relevance to the actual plot. Even Dungeons' story was better, and it was also a kids' story with a simplistic plot. I even think Story Mode's story was better, and that's hilariously low.

Lastly, my personal problem with these spin-off games. While I actually simp for Dungeons both in gameplay and style, I do think these spin-off games throttle and bottleneck the creativity and potential for vanilla Minecraft. Microsoft would rather allocate a small team to each version of Minecraft vanilla, the one game that consistently makes them millions, causing the game to suffer in events like the 1.17-1.19 updates because they simply don't have enough corporate manpower to fulfill their promises. The ""Modders can do x y and z in like 2 weeks"" narrative hardly applies to these people because there's so many more layers to their development process due to their corporate environment. Regardless, there's so much creativity and mind blowing ideas put into Dungeons, and I'll even admit into some of Legends (like the hand-painted terrain)! And because these ideas which would arguably be even more powerful in vanilla are in a spin-off game, instead, we can only hope to get something like it in vanilla. Thankfully we've gotten pillagers and piglins.

Oh, and can I ask what Deluxe edition was supposed to do? Did I just pay 10 extra dollars for fun or something? To top it off, there's SERIOUSLY minecoins in this fucking game? I get it in vanilla because the game is continually being supported for free, but they actually expect me to use minecoins in Legends? This just sucks. I'll probably be editing this as I experience more shit during gameplay or if I find certain aspects I perhaps judged too harshly. Overall, I do not recommend this game, especially at the price it stands at now. Go play Dungeons or vanilla.",0.0

4867,136987620.0,1976950,"Dear reader, hang tight, as this will be a long one.

Desktop Dungeons and I go way back, and I have many fond memories of this gem, being familiar with it since the early Alphas,  dating way back from circa 2010. Ever since then, the seeds of its genre bending, non-conforming, innovative gameplay were already planted,
becoming fully realized in 2013, refining many of the systems and mechanics seen in said Alpha.

Now, in brilliant fashion, we see yet another polished iteration of the game, Desktop Dungeons Rewind, a prety clever addition to the title that I'll explain further down the review.

Now, enough with the reverie. What even is this thing!?

As I mentioned, Desktop Dungeons Rewind (henceforth simply DDR, for brevity) doesn't conform to a set genre, but rather, the interplay between many aspects of established genres is what makes the game tick. 

You have top down dungeons with random layouts (with set rules to
ensure it is beatable) from roguelikes, playable classes and fantasy races from most RPGs (each with unique traits), as well as equipment, inventories and other such staples, but in a very unique way of going about it.

Another layer that makes the weird and wonderful DDR sandwich is resource management, but not in the way you might be used to - you are not building a base to survive relentless waves of monsters; resource management is key to be able to outlast and beat enemies.
Health, Magic, Experience, Spells, Equipment and even the exploration of the dungeon itself are resources.

Each ""dungeon"" can roughly fit in one screen (though there are multiple floors, in many cases) and the overall objective is winning by beating the boss (or, in some cases, bosses) and exiting the dungeon triumphant. Monsters are distributed in such a way that their levels range from 1 all the way to 10 (the bosses). 

This aspect of the game could be considered something of a puzzle game; different dungeons have different denizes with their own innate abilities and statistics that need to be taken into account with each engagement.

Combat is entirely tactical and deterministic, with the combat predictor being a large part of how enemies are approached, and utilizing everything at one's disposal (and even knowing when to let go of such things) ends up ""clicking"" and leads to an 
incredible feeling of clarity. 

There are so many options, synergies, and individual equipment pieces with varied effects 
that the ever elusive elation of emergent play happens here naturally.

When defeated, the player is given the option to try the run again, ""rewinding"" time to roughly the halfway point, restoring the state of play and allowing the player to redo mistakes.

Besides dungeon spelunking, the player has some light management aspects to contend with, mostly allowing for meta progression unlocks that range from items, classes, races and more, allow allowing for a more customizable, front loaded approach to future expeditions, as
well as practical puzzles for the struggling player (I wholeheartly recommend any newcomer to try them).

All in all, the game is a one of a kind experience that cannot be contained or defined in simple terms,  a kind of beautiful genre chimera that one can't help but love once its ingenuity and heart become clear to the player.",1.0
4868,136987562.0,1976950,"[h2]Recommended for fans of puzzlers with a fantasy roguelike spin.[/h2]

Going to go ahead and give devs a thumbs up here. It's a great game and the devs are some real standup folks. As am sure most know by now, they gave this game out free to owners of their first game which was insanely generous and just goes to show the level of respect they have for their fanbase. (Thanks devs)

In a nutshell, this game is identical to the OG Desktop Dungeons save a few things like some much needed balance changes and supporting newer GPU's/monitors. Game is so much easier on the eyes if you own a large monitor compared to the old game and now we can even zoom in very close to our little heroes which just helps this aspect further. It really looks and plays well on newer hardware without losing the original charm of the first game. 

Overall the game is a solid remaster and am very happy with it. I do have a couple minor complaints however. The biggest offender here is the lack of a Codex. The Codex carried all sorts of valuable information and stats to keep track of your playtime, what you've unlocked, information on monsters and all sorts of great stuff. All of which is absent in this game and that really kills the enjoyment I could have with this game as I love pouring over stats. I would call myself a stats junky and so not having any is pretty painful. Devs did say if things turn out well, they will devote a bunch of time to adding the Codex for this game too. So I really hope this game gets the attention it deserves so they can do just that because it's a good game and I'd love to see some more content/updates! 

The only other issue I have aside from the missing Codex is some bugs. I've encountered a couple in my short time, one was a 'infinite' saving bug where it just was 'saving' forever preventing me from closing the game and another was a main quest bug that had me redo the same quest multiple times. 

Other than those issues, this game is truly awesome. I love the new look and feel and being able to see everything on my monitor without straining my eyes. It feels a lot more fluid too and just dungeon crawling is a lot more fun this time around in general. All the silly humor and unique art direction from the original is here, just with a modernized look and feel. The only things missing are like I said, a Codex and maybe some touchpad/controller support so we can play this on TV's/tablets. 

Definitely a keeper if you enjoy puzzle roguelikes with lots of replay value and unlocks. For $20 full price (currently on sale) it's a steal considering how much playtime you can get out of it. Easy thumbs up. Great devs and even better game.",1.0

Pros; 
-Story is very strong and Sylas Arc is neat. If it's canon then it makes me enjoy it a lot more
-The gameplay and controls (Mouse and Keyboard) feel very fluid and nice. 
-The animation on all the spells and characters are super clean and well animated
-Major bosses are super cool fights and have lots of awesome combos (Lets be honest, you will spam light and heavy attack without bothering with the combos)
-The characters exclusive to the game such as Yops and Leilana are super well written and I enjoyed them
-Good variety of enemies and compelling main villain 
Cons;
-As much as I liked it. It is not worth 30 dollars. i beat the game in 10.5 hours. (And almost all achievements and all side quests) Short Story
-No voice acting outside of cut scenes was pretty disappointing, (and there are voice lines but they are ripped directly from league of legends for characters such as Shyvana, Sylas, Lux, Garen, Morgana, and Jarvan IV) characters other than the cast from League have no voice lines at all.
-The combat is becomes repetitive after a while. 
-Every villain but the main one, (not including Jarvan or Shyvana) are very lifeless and they have nothing compelling about them. 
Overall i enjoyed it and i 100% recommend it on a sale but i think you should save your money until then. Thank you for reading.

I will only be talking about campaign/coop content, as I have not done PvP (it is atrocious, there is no chat).

The campaign gameplay consists of attacking Piglin bases and defending villages, the gameplay is fairly simple but the gameplay loop feels fun once you get into it. The way you'll have the most fun is to unfortunately not engage with the RTS part of the game for the most part, commanding your units is a chore because banner view (a mode which allows you to command specific units in your army) is horrendous to use, gathering all your units after sending them somewhere is tedious, and there is no strategy to choosing which units you bring with you (bring a few healers and bring whatever other unit you prefer). Not only that, but units will get stuck on terrain and kill themselves in lava, among other things, it really doesn't help that the AI is severely lacking in the staying alive department.

The best way we found to have fun is to engage in ridiculous concepts, that is to say; cure netherrack to be able to build in enemy bases, build cannons/arrow towers or whatever else, and go to town, it's fun to launch TNT at enemy structures while being bombarded with crates containing enemies, or getting shot with exploding spikes.

There isn't much else to say about gameplay, experimenting is a good way to enjoy the game, but it still becomes incredibly repetitive after a while, so unless you enjoy repetitive gameplay loops, I recommend you do not play this game.

You do technically get stronger in the game, so there is progression:
You earn Prismarine for defending villages/destroying bases, which you can then use to unlock resources and improve the maximum amount of those resources you can hold, therefore increasing  your fighting options and power.

Atmosphere is spot on, especially in combat, the combat music especially fits the sheer chaos that ensues while taking on enemy bases, the sound design has a ton of personality, and I've never seen something like it. In terms of atmosphere, the game truly is its own universe.

There is a clear lack of polish when doing certain things, notably building. Whenever you build a wall in this game, you designate a length of wall for your Allays to build, this is fine, it works well, it's intuitive. However, in order to destroy that wall, you are required to remove each pillar making up the wall ONE BY ONE, it is ridiculous, this should not be allowed, you could almost call it being taken hostage. This might be fine with you, but it doesn't stop there, because just interacting with the bits of walls is an endless nightmare, it's insanely clunky, high chance you'll destroy that gate you placed instead of the wall.

Multiplayer can be unplayable at times, it's fine when you're just building or exploring, but there are constant disconnections while attacking bases (especially large ones). Resources are shared between every player, so unless you're playing with friends, it's possible you'll have someone draining all the resources for themselves without giving a damn about you, and as mentioned previously, there is no way to coordinate because there is no way to communicate with other players except by pinging stuff, and even that doesn't work well because there are no specific pings, no ""enemy spotted"" ping, you just ping with no indication as to what it means. The maximum amount of units you can summon is also shared between players, so have fun wrestling with other people in order to have your own army.

Be warned;
There are microtransactions in the game (you might have noticed the ""Minecoin"" currency below the ""add to card"" buttons), and it appears to me that some new gameplay content will be locked behind the marketplace, because for the first Lost Legends chapter (basically additional content, it's base game but with different gameplay mechanics, the first Lost Legends chapter is free and is a wave defense gamemode), you are sent to the marketplace in order to pay zero Minecoins, it is free, but it doesn't bode well for new Lost Legends content.
If you don't like the sound of that, I recommend you wait a while and see what happens before buying.

4904,136989914.0,2340800,"I recently played Life Changer and I think it's impressive. The game allows me to create my own destiny and shape my own life. I particularly loved the fact that I could compete with my friends or go on a personal journey of self-improvement against computer. It's not common to find a good life simulation game that offers both competitive and solo options, not even the SIMS, so it was a pleasant surprise.

Another feature of Life Changer that I am fond of was its RPG elements, such as map exploration and character development with the ability to advance your virtual character's education and career. You start the game in middle school and have the opportunity to work your way up to a bachelor's degree and beyond, even completing a doctorate! It's exciting to see my character's educational journey unfold and the impact it has on their career prospects.

Speaking of careers, I was impressed by the level of detail in the game's career system. You can start off your career from a humble janitorial position, and work your way up the ranks and potentially become the CEO of a large company. The game provides a sense of satisfaction as you climb the career ladder and achieve financial stability, all while making strategic decisions along the way.

One of my favorite features in the game was the investment simulation, which not only allowed me to invest in various assets like businesses and properties but also gave me the ability to upgrade and improve my virtual businesses. Through strategic investment decisions, I was able to grow my wealth and attain financial stability in the game, which added an extra level of excitement to the gameplay.

I was pleasantly surprised as well by the educational value of Life Changer. Through playing the game, I learned valuable life skills and financial literacy, which I can apply to my real-life situations. It was a great way to learn while having fun.

Overall, Life Changer is a good life simulation game that is both enjoyable and empowering. It has what I need to achieve my personal growth and success goals, from education and career advancement to financial stability and happiness. ",1.0

This game doesn't offer anything that other games in this genre don't and it doesn't seem to do anything better either. Parrying is mandatory meaning the only way to face a challenge is with parry, which ignores player agency of choosing how to fight an enemy right off the bat. You only get to choose which equipment, stats and cool parry effect you're forced into.

I'm not opposed to having one mechanic be the ideal way to play the game, where compared to all other strategies it's the most effective. But forcing a single strategy on a player and hoping they know how it works? Calling yourself a metroidvania and souls-like while only having one way to face a challenging encounter is just... why? Those games give you tools which you can use in a number of ways in different situations (combat, platforming, exploring, environmental effects like a light from a torch).

4947,129119628.0,1642790,"Let me preface this by saying that this isn't a terrible game by any stretch. It's competent and does what it says it'll do which is for the most part just fine. You create a character and set out on a linear(ish) adventure through some interconnected stages from start to finish and fight some bosses along the way. The game's difficulty is middle-to-high and it has no qualms in punishing you heavily for screwing up repeatedly. Par for the course for souls-likes which would be well and good were it not for a few critical flaws that stop me from really recommending the game and instead slapping it in the ""no thank you"" pile.

What I didn't dig :
For the starters, the game DEMANDS that you parry. Not parrying is a death sentence from the very early start to the very end -- some encounters downright impossible without it. The bulk of your damage will come from counter-attacking posture-broken enemies. This is fine, I can get behind it -- i love some high-parry gameplay that rewards good reading, however i find myself utterly frustrated by how janky the parry feels in the game. Let me explain -- parry windows are usually fairly strict in these games, but they make up for it by giving you legible telegraphs with few unnecessary ""held"" attacks (basically a still windup animation). Parry gameplay revolves around fluidity and legibility, and will usually at least give you some leeway in case you miss that parry window. This game however does not give you these amenities; your parry window is wide and very generous, but enemy attacks consist of elden-ring type windups that are borderline unending (some enemies will legit hold for almost a full second after their windup animation, while your parry window falls to about 500ms). Because these holds are fairly still you have to memorize rather than react for parries. This isn't my cup of tea in the slightest and I much prefer having parries be a result of a good read, not counting down how long an enemy will hold before they release a very clearly designated attack. 

Secondly, this game features some precision platforming segments. While some platforming is expected, certain areas are literally dotted with spikes along floors, walls barring one small crease for you to dash through, failue will have you take damage and respawn on your last safe ledge. Compound this with enemy placement designed to make you fight in those tight quarters, and a long recovery animation if you touch spikes and you can find yourself getting infinitely comboed by enemies who will hit you off a platform -- where you hit spikes and respawn without being able to move -- only to be knocked back down again and for this to repeat until your death. Not cool. At least give me control once I respawn so i can keep fighting.

Lastly, blocking is flat out broken. I don't mean this in the sense that you can't block -- you can. Be releasing the block button leaves you locked in place for the length of your parry window but without your block active - despite your character still clearly being in a blocking stance. This feels TERRIBLE when fighting with weapons that require any sort of windup (like axe or staff) since a missed parry leaves you almost no room to at least do a bit of chip damage in. 

The stuff I did enjoy:
The level design, color palettes and art are all really good. Visually this game looks great and really gives you a lot to look at. The palette choices for every area feels unique and the level design mixed in with it gives you a generally clear way ahead (barring the mercy colossus fight, which has a hint hidden on a signpost by the arena telling you how to progress). The enemy design is a little bare (a few recolors here and there) but each enemy feels unique in its presentation and gives you a clear indication that it's different.

The music and sound effects are nice and somber, and while not outstanding, are more than above average. This is no ender lillies, but it's got a vibe that's easy to settle into.

The weapon variety is more than enough -- each weapon type feels very distinct in its approach and playstyle and the game gives you a lot of room to experiment with builds and isn't terrible about giving you the option to respec fairly early on using dark fire seeds. Armors are quite unique in that each set will give you a set bonus -- however this does mean you wont be mixing sets like you would in some games. You can, but why would you ?

Stuff im neutral on:
The punishment for death in stripping you from your armor until you use a consumable at a specific NPC is ... interesting. I have no problems with it, it fits the lore and adds a bit of a layer of tedium to deal with if you get stonewalled in a particular place. Having to stop what you're doing to go get your armor back feels unnecesary -- the resources to do it are abundant (i had well over 30 of them by the time i stopped about 5 hours in) and are easily farmable. 

The story is servicable, it isn't bad nor particularly amazing. I haven't found myself terriby attached to it, but I wasn't skipping over dialogue either.


Overall this game's a fairly mid ""neutral"" for me. I'm sure i'll eventually shrug and finish off the last hour or two I seem to have left on it, but the frustration with the forced parrying and bad telegraphs has ultimately left me feeling fairly apathetic towards the game. Your mileage may vary if that's your thing though.",0.0

https://youtu.be/KLJMQ1SeC5E

Deepening Fire is a Souls like, horizontal, early access game with cartoonish graphics a lovely story and a lot to do and explore.


This is the first game created byVeryBigDog who entered the rough world of Indie souls like games on Steam. I wish the best for them, and I am still confused how this game can be still in Early Access with all the content in it.


[h1]Gameplay / Story[/h1]

Complete confusion. This game is a complete confusion for me. When it popped up and our beloved Klaus tried to force me to play it like a mother force-feeds a 6-month year old, I was not amused. First red flag, its Early Access 2D side scrolling game. Second red flag, it's 2D souls like. Third Red flag, it's a one-man developer team. Fourth Red Flag: It looks like an Armor Games developed Flash game on the Videos and Screenshots. What happened then? I barely eat for 2 days and made a 7 Hours long Video and beat the game. Forgot the second amulet to have the true ending, and maybe I will play it again.


This game is a typical souls like, you got a dash function to dodge, a great parry function that activates a skill, in abused the ""healing skill"". You start as a guy who has no clue what happened in a calamity wasted world engulfed in fire and hate. There is no narration as it's a typical in this dark games. People tell you the story, letters tell you about the uncomfortable world and how everything gone from bad to worse to Nestle owns all our fresh water in the world. You get great stages that are unique, you have companions that tell their story. You have a Ninja Samurai who helps you find new people for your Garden. Your Garden is mostly the point you can talk, take haircuts and teleport to new worlds. This game has really hard boss fights but is extremely fair on save points and items in case your skin burns, and you can't carry armor anymore. Yes, he had to implement that. The only stupid thing is, range is by far powerful, not due to the damage but due to the constant damage you can provide since you do not have to dodge in range, and you can ""pew pew"" out of rage. And you know what you fight at the end? A Planet and super nova eating entity who can instantly kill you by eating you like the black void.


[h1]Pro[/h1]

+ a lot of different enemies
+ Stages are unique with easy but nice puzzles
+ unique Bosses with unique skill sets
+ NPC's you will learn to love
+ devastating story with great Dark Souls storytelling
+ a lot of Armor with unique set Bonus
+ RPG function to level up your character
+ Weapons, Staffs, Swords, Lance, Axe, Daggers it's great
+ the effects are great
+ the sound is amazing
+the controls are smooth and responsive


[h1]Contra[/h1]


- The Last Boss is really hard
- Some stages are confusing, one end boss is only accessible when letting an enemy destroy the floor.


[h1]What can the Dev do to improve the game?[/h1]

Oh hello there, since it's early access it might be good to give some advice right? Well, there isn't much I can say but:

+ More Swords please, I found like 3 through the game and a lot of other weapons, but I'm the kinda Sword guy in video games.

+ Some Book to see which items are currently missing and need to be found would be great.

[h1]Conclusion/ Who will enjoy the game?[/h1]

Deepening Fire offers an addictive game with unique Bosses and a really great effort for the souls like games. This game was such a surprise. All Red Flags were actually Green Flags. I cannot understand why this game is still marked as Early access? It's a bit pricey for the 7 hours of content, but it's a full game without any real issue. I have seen AAA Titles more unfinished at full release than this piece of art.


Who will enjoy this game? Do you like Dark Souls? Shovel Knight? Want to feel a satisfying feeling when doing a parry? Look, I can't give this game enough justice, just do yourself a favor and fast-forward the gameplay video I did and see for yourself how awesome everything fits together.

4963,136993747.0,1967630,"I am really liking this game, but I have some constructive feedback....

Pro's
- Visually great looking
- Challenging in terms of keeping healthy
- Large maps/ areas to explore
- lots to construct and things to build (work stations etc)
- Small elements of good things from other games (Crafting, exploring, sailing).

Con's / constructive

1) Basic things like sticks/stones can take 20 mins to go find (not in abundance) like the Forest
- When you need 4 sticks and need to run 15 mins to a tree on the other side of the island
- When you need a stone, the minimal 2-3 formations are empty and you need to find a random round stone
- Running past trees/bushes which can't be farmed (no animation) like on Raft is grindy

2) Away from the story, the game can feel bland like ""Raft""
- Lots of random small islands with nothing on them
- It's great building kilns etc, but clay is very rare in most areas - which defeats wanting to build a base/items.
- Same animals all over, dog, snake, and scorpion placed near resources makes it a bit ""MMO"" feeling

3) Resources are spread far too wide, with 3 or 4 stone piles on a large island (when running past millions of rock 
  formations)
- Large Island - Great! Lots of trees and rocks - Awesome! Can you mine most of it - NO?
- Throw stuff like random big sticks, branches, and more sticks around, let us build and be creative once the story/ initial survival element is getting stale.
- No animations/time consumption for crafting - often contradicts the survival system

When you first spawn in, getting sunburned, thirsty, and naked...feels like the movie ""Cast Away"" which is AWESOME!

After a while, it starts feeling like the game ""Raft"" where it's nice and pretty, but so much missing and there could be so much more to do...please add this whilst it's in early access! :)",1.0
4964,136992989.0,1308360,"Firstly, I’d like to start by saying that the original soundtrack for GUN JAM is an absolute triumph! In my option, every track here is a winner, and amplifies the already fast paced gameplay 10-fold. There’s something which makes you feel really cool when you hit the beat just right, and while you probably won’t nail a song the first time round, it’s fun going back in a second time trying to master it.

The ability to add my own songs to the game and have them auto mapped is awesome, I’ve found that playing around with bpm until it feels just right (Sometimes going above the recommended 200bpm) leads to some really great results, and I’ve started making manual adjustments to a few tracks too.

4974,136994073.0,1929250,"I beat what's currently available in this game in 6.4 hours: level 3 of the 3 maps, ending with Lunar Colony.  It was a challenge and absolutely packed with fun.  I have a lot of praise to give for the game, and a list of minor gripes.  Note that these are very minor gripes, and I still recommend the game overall.

Gripe number 1: Even though I'm using a gamepad with analog directional control, the movement seems to lock in to the 8 directions.  There are rotations between and I can fiddle back and forth to stay between, but if I'm not constantly moving the analog stick away from my intended direction, it doesn't follow the exact direction I'm using with the analog control.  I think the game would be better with this fixed, since I see no reason to lock into cardinal directions.  This is my main gripe with the game.

Gripe number 2: There are only 3 or 4 good upgrades on each weapon in the end of the game.  I want to get the cooldown reduction, damage, and crit on all my weapons.  If I get them, I clear everything with no problem.  If I happen to miss them on any of my weapons, the swarm becomes overwhelming and I can't beat the curve.

Gripe number 3: Each weapon is limited to 3 upgrades.  There is a ton of synergy between upgrades and I would have loved to focus on 1 weapon and get a ton of upgrades for it, which would limit the upgrades I can get for other weapons.  That would be very cool.  Unfortunately, you are forced to upgrade weapons you don't like instead of being able to pile onto 1 awesome weapon.  In combination with gripe number 2, all the weapons feel samey in the end if you want to win every battle.

Gripe number 4: Getting to the intended strafe angle wastes your movement significantly.  If I want to face a swarm and mow it down, I have to first get far away from them, then turn around and run toward them fairly significantly, such that it's very wasteful.  In the end-game, it's almost never a good idea to try that unless you have plenty of space.  It's better to get lucky with your enemy positions in the early game and run toward them.  This kind of defeats the coolness factor of learning to use the strafing system.  I would prefer if you could turn independently of your movement, even if that required some kind of upgrade.  If that happened, it would be also nice to have more than 1 decent weapon that takes advantage of your facing direction.  The laser is good but encourages never strafing, and the diagonal shot is just garbage in my experience.

Gripe number 5: Only the first mech that's unlocked by default is any good, and only the second pilot that's unlocked is good.  Choosing the other mechs than the one that has good handling or pilots than the one that increases attack speed is a sure way to lose in the highest difficulties.  It would be nice if later mechs and pilots that are unlocked had advantages, but they seem to be worse.  The mech that provides speed has such terrible handling that it's unusable, and the mech that adds max hp is useless because its other stats are worse and the max hp doesn't come back any faster if you're damaged.

Gripe number 6: The number of non-weapon upgrades you can get are artificially limited in such a way that you can break your whole run if you get the wrong ones.  If you don't get the healing upgrade, you are pretty much guaranteed to lose in the end-game.  Movement speed and handling are good together, but you're bound to take a hit or two whenever you get surrounded, and the healing upgrade is so significant that it's almost mandatory to succeed.  I tried a few runs without it and I only won without it once.

Gripe number 7: Leveling to max level is guaranteed on every full run, so you end up running out of ways to upgrade around the 10-to-12-minute mark, which leaves 8 to 9 minutes of no upgrading and just shooting and dodging.  It would be nice to be able to get further upgrades.  Maybe something like that is coming with meta-progression, but currently with the max level of 60, it feels a bit less fun after 12 minutes.

Gripe number 8: While I'm only half-way through the meta-progression after having beaten the last available mission, all the future meta-progression upgrades available are almost worthless.  I have the ones that boost damage, and the ones that boost handling and healing, but the rest do things that don't really matter, so I'm left wondering how I'll be able to increase my power for any harder missions.

Gripe number 9: The bosses at the end of each run are essentially jokes.  By the time I reached the third boss in each run (the last boss), I was so powerful that it would die in under 3 seconds if I just faced it and punched it.  I would have liked to see something like all the other enemies going away when the boss spawns and the boss being a serious threat on its own, at least in threat level 3 runs.  It'd be really cool to see the gameplay shift that would come with something like that.

Despite all these minor gripes, the game kicks ass.  Here are some praises off the top of my head, and I'm not sure I can recall everything I liked:

- I played on Linux, and the game ran perfectly, and my gamepad worked immediately.
- There were absolutely 0 performance dips below 60 fps, which is my monitor's native refresh rate.  I'm using an Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti.
- I encountered only 1 bug in the entire time I played, it was in the menu and caused a button to be disabled when it should be enabled, and it resolved itself with some simple re-navigation which enabled the buggy button.
- The music and sounds are amazing, and I never felt the need to turn the sound off and replace it with a background video or my own music.
- There is legitimate challenge which doesn't feel too frustrating.  There are definitely moments when it felt impossible to succeed just because of unlucky upgrade options, but buying some meta-progression and restarting the mission to try again a few times always resulted in a sense of progress and never just hopelessness.
- The limitations of the current version of the game are clearly exhibited with ""Coming soon"" buttons for future maps, mechs, and pilots, so I feel like even though I beat the game, I have more fun ahead.  I'm hoping the devs follow through because I'm excited to see any changes.
- The price is fair for the game; just about the upper limit for a game I'd purchase individually without a bundle, considering I already have almost 1000 games and haven't played more than half of them.
- This game is the best mech game I've ever played, and really makes me feel like I'm piloting a monstrous mech that has superior technology compared to vast armies of traditional units.
- The enemies and graphics are very clear as to what will hurt you and what is good, while maintaining that unique feeling that comes from being in a huge mech.",1.0

But there are a few things that I got issues with just like the other players.

Probably my two cents worth on future ideas if it gets considered for it. *hopefully*

Research
- Needs more ways to acquire Research points
-- *Invasion: Alien Corpses, have scientists be able to dissect them to gain additional Science Points and Theories for Patents, probably a new item like a Dissection Table.
-- Allowing  Scientists to be able to acquire Science Points / Basic theory through the research table at a slower rate

Money
- Needs a variety of ways of income, not just Patents. Maybe I have not reached to a point where I will be getting income from different Star Locations in the Star Map.

Star Map
- Needs a variety of Benefits that helps the Base, Be it, Science Points, Income, Materials, Exclusive Equipments/Furnitures and etc
-- Some form of Extraction portion that can allow Players to send out teams to Collect Science Points, Materials and etc.

Invasion / Combat Mechanics
- Invasion is frequent, which is good on my end.
-- Alien Corpses as mentioned above needs to be able to Dissect for Science Points and have a slight chance of getting materials for Workshops to create equipment (I have not gotten to the workshop portion before I got bankrupt)
-- Guards are not proactive in engaging the Aliens when they emerge out of the gate. They will only engage when they are like two-three boxes away. 
--- Either a function to allow players to 'Target' the Aliens so the Guards would engage when triggered or an alert system to alert of the Guards to draw arms / engage the Aliens.",1.0

What I didnt like at first impression was how stiff and slow everything is, coupled with the ""Long Dark"" style of time passing during certain actions you make. But I now very much appreciate how the physics of the player work in the game, as it feels more grounded in realism, and really isn't that bad at all. The time passing mechanic kinda grew on me as it actually keeps the pace of the game going from decision to decision and I have absolutely no complaints.

What keeps me hooked on playing the game is the immersion I feel in the world. The graphics are great , but not fascinating and they remain consistently polished to the point where every asset on the island and it's surrounding waters feels like it belongs.

5019,136999571.0,1941780," How to start... Perhaps first to shortly describe two runs, then to write my observations and suggestions.
     First run (Easy difficulty): Was very short. Melee attacks seemed to be very weak and very quickly I was low on health. Also, in first few houses was nothing of use, just a bit of pistol ammo but no weapons or pickups whatsoever. Then went to a metal factory marked with a green exclamation mark and I've found a first and only weapon - Tokarev rifle. Had only 6 bullets, managed to eliminate two zombies but all of a sudden a horde of 6-7 zombies just spawned from the room behind (which was cleared) and that was the first death. I've respawned in the safe house but literally in the second room there was a horde of zombies waiting and that was second death. Next respawn zombies were there in the very exact room where I've had spawned and that was the third death, only within first few seconds of being respawned. Total first run was less that 10 minutes.
     Second run (Easy difficulty again): Spawned in a safe house, nothing there, moved to a next house and oh boy...a jackpot (both in good and not so good way). Few items were there at once - Welrod pistol, M32 Grease Gun, some ammo.. But once I've picked up those, almost immediately other items started to spawn. And was like that for good 15-20 minutes - whenever i picked up something, something else respawned within several second. Total, had over 200 pistol ammo, almost 150 rifle ammo, around 70 sniper ammo, perhaps 40 shotgun ammo, lots of candy bars, cough syrup, energy drinks, two or three of each Welrod, Grease Guns and M1 carbines, as well as a knife and a wooden bat. With all that, managed to survive quite long, perhaps over 50 minutes. Reason for the first death in this run was automatic increase in difficulty (I guess it was), as, the scale reached pink / purple-ish color saying ""Insane"". Zombies started to spawn all over, a lot of them, behavior changed completely - they were detecting me from very far away (even though it was night time), they were jumping over the walls, going into houses.. Even when I reached the safe house, they were not only going inside but were respawning inside cleared rooms as well, glitching through the walls and closed doors too. Second and third death were very quick, as, difficulty meter was on Insane, managed to reach two more houses but since all rooms over there were completely empty, I've died twice empty handed, as there were too many zombies.
       Impressions and suggestions:
     - Very nice concept, lots of room for expanding the core gameplay with open-world maps, random generation, scripted maps,..
     - Lots of potential for different types of maps and game modes. Can be fully- or semi-random generated maps, scenario maps with linear or branching objectives / paths. (Heroes of Might & Magic 3 flashbacks kicking in :) )
     - Huge modding potential. Hope that game developers will include modding tools and work on having active and friendly modding community. Really enormous potential for that to happen, as the basic game concepts offer a lot of room for modding.
     Suggestions and personal opinions about game mechanics so far:
    - Starting unarmed only. Okay, but needs to be more impactfull. Damage with both ""1"" weapon slot and ""F"" key attack are too weak. Even if you have, for example, a rifle equipped, hits with weapon buttstock seemed weaker than hits with fists. Knife and wooden bat too, haven't noticed any difference in the amount of the damage dealt. Also, when wielding a melee weapon, perhaps a right mouse button could serve as a block, as zooming with a melee weapon has no purpose.
     - Firearms. So far, okay variety for open alpha. Even though, hits with a firearm don't feel that much impactful, even when you hit a zombie in the head. Very little noticeable difference in weapon damage - whether it's a Welrod pistol, M1 carbine or Tokarev rifle. Zombies just keep running towards you, start jumping, moving really fast.. Here, feel that game developers could have to choose between arcade or a bit more realistic approach in firearms and weapon combat. Or, perhaps both to be available, as in-game options when creating a world map / lobby.
     - Weapon slots. Personally, feel it's very restrictive and maybe it would be better just to leave the slots open for any kind of weapons a player desire. That could allow for more flexibility, adapting to weapon pickups (as drops are random) and more enjoyment in multiplayer matches, where players could specialize and customize loadouts, exchange weapons in-game as they see it fit to their strategies and playstyle.
     - Item drops. Way too little. Item drops are very scarce, often there is absolutely nothing to pickup. Health and support items too. Aside from that spawning bug in second run, almost all of the houses were completely empty. In my opinion, balancing difficulties, giving an enjoyable or challenging gameplay stems from giving items and pickups to players while balancing environment, enemies, meaningful challenges etc.. and not from denying the basic items and leaving the players completely empty handed.
     - Environment. So far, completely empty. Would be great to be able to scrounge through the cupboards, shelves, refrigerators, ovens, etc.. to give players more incentive for exploration and immersion. Perhaps a rare drop chance in wardrobe closets to find new clothes, avatar accessories,.. Lots of the world objects - such as fire extinguishers, boxes, dishes, ventilators chairs, etc.. - perhaps could be used as pick-and-throw objects that can deal damage and stun zombies. Also, plates with food, baskets of fruits that are often found in kitchen tables..perhaps could be a one-time health or stamina consumables. Maybe to introduce wending machines scattered throughout the map too.
     - Health and stamina mechanics. Health seems okay so far, even though healing items are almost non-existent. Aside (again) that spawning bug when I got lost of cough syrup (which instantly fills the health bar by some amount) and a candy bar (which seems bugged, as description says it regenerates health when hunger icon is full but it doesn't do that, no health regeneration effect). Perhaps healing items should be more present, in different varieties and healing mechanics.
About stamina.. Seems fair that it's used for active actions such as jumping, sprinting, dodging.. But huge problem is that every action decreases your maximum stamina bar so eventually you come to a situation where you have very little max stamina available, which disables a player from actively dodging in succession, jumping over the fences or windows.. (which is a cool mechanic, being able to just jump though the window but needs a bit of polish as often avatar just jumps in a spot instead of through the window, even though you're standing correctly).
     - Day / Night cycle. Nice addition and immersion mechanic. Perhaps it could be more meaningful later in the future, with specific types of enemies appearing in different times of a day. Or, perhaps an in-fight mechanics (similar like in classic Doom, where different types of monsters attack each other).
     - Enemy variety. Noticed only a regular type of zombies. But, really don't like that enemy behavior is changing on the fly - they are either standing or rushing and jumping towards you. It breaks the zombie immersion for me. Also, magically spawning from nowhere or behind a player from a room that was cleared just don't feel fair.
     - Difficulty scaling. Should stay as declared, not raise automatically every 10 minutes or so. Perhaps ""aggro / notoriety"" system around a small area, similar like in GTA.
     - Perk / skills system. Adding an additional reason to have skills, character progression / specialization.
Hope this can be a constructive feedback to developers and I'm looking forward to see this game as a new indie hit, like Ravenfield.",1.0

5023,136998833.0,1537830,"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is one of my all-time favorite games. Whatever you imagine when you hear ""Disney Kart Racing Game"": Disney Speedstorm is most certainly not that! This game is suprisingly unique, and not just another ""Mario Kart Clone"". It has a great sense of speed. The tracks may not be as creative as in Nintendo's game, but the core gameplay here is also much less about ""get around curves fast"", and more about ""combo various types of speed boosts for max speed"". And it's also unexpected how much STYLE this game has, from it's graphical presentation and especially it's electronic music soundtrack, that has some killer hits!
Technically I also had no issues so far, and it runs great on the Steam Deck. Online Multiplayer is fun, but a suprisingly huge chunk of the content is for singleplayer races. Characters do level up and get better stats. They do have individual powers that are noticably imbalanced. So if you are looking for an arcade racer for balanced and skill-focused competiton, this is not the game for you. Play this for it's breakneck feeling of speed and the insane action moments it puts on your screen!

The elephant in the room is the games monetization. Well, you can't gloss over it: outside of its races the games looks exactly a free2play mobile game, and if you hate every aspect of free2play games, this will be your nightmare. It has it all: paid season pass, various currencies, cosmetics, lootboxes, content on cooldown,...
This IS a free2play game, that is scheduled for release in late 2023 or 2024. Right now, you're not buying a game, you're literally paying to get EARLY ACCESS to this new, FREE game, in it's current state. So please do your research and make sure you know what you get yourself into, to avoid frustrations.

I, personally, am having a blast so far with this suprisingly stylish and fast arcade action racer, that gives me something to play everyday. Since the content is broken up into seasons, I will make my personal verdict on this after the end of the first season, when I know how far I progressed, how much time the game demanded to experience and unlock its seasonal content and, most important, how much fun I had during these weeks. Then I will see if I'll keep playing, or leave the game for good.

So right know, though I'm having a lot of fun, I can't actually recommend this to anyone, unless you are very aware about what you are getting, when you purchase a Founder's Pack.",1.0

You guys messed this one up, though. Here's what needs to change to have a chance at a positive review:

- Allow me to see the entire map on one screen. I don't like zooming and panning around for my ""coffee-break game,"" I want to see everything at once so I can make quick, informed strategic decisions.

- Allow me to turn off the animations. I don't need to see the characters and enemies fight each other, I want to watch numbers subtract from each other so I can move on to the next set of numbers as quickly as possible.

- Fix the GOD AWFUL UI. It takes double the time to make out anything in this mess of information, including the frigging character select screen. Labels would be nice -- I don't want to mouse over a dwarf to see that it's a dwarf. Why are all their heads brown with no distinguishing characteristics? WTF? Why do I have to click the challenge flags to see what they are? The information on the game map all blends in to the background. You should have DD non-veterans playtest this UI. The only reason I got through was that I had most of this stuff memorized.

- There's nothing wrong with the word ""race,"" why did you do this? I'm more put off by the gore and violence you added -- the opening title has a monster keeling over and spilling blood across the screen. One of your trailers shows an adventurer's bloody, dismembered head falling to the ground. Yes, there were little blood pools in the original, but that's nothing compared to this. Guess I won't be playing this game with my kids -- the word ""race"" is far less objectionable.

5029,136999171.0,1928870,"as an ADHD-haver and Minecraft enjoyer with no real experience with RTS games or things like Pikmin, I sat down and binged the story (and only the story) in two days. I'm just going to share my thoughts with that perspective in mind, so please consider that!

I want to open by agreeing with the fact that, as the game is on launch, it's not worth a $40-50 USD price tag. while the game is beautiful and I somehow ran into minimal issues performance-wise, I agree that the story is fairly bare bones as it is and is actually quite short in comparison to most games these days (roughly 10 hours, could be shorter if you decided not to explore much)
that being said, this is a children's game! it's a game made for children targeted as children, I wasn't expecting a story with depth or any real length to it, and as someone who has never played an RTS, I found the gameplay fairly challenging without the aspects of co-op or PVP involved

I did play about an hour or two in story co-op, but didn't get any connectivity issues or anything. what I [i]did[/i] find out was that one person skipping cutscenes skipped them for [i]EVERYBODY[/i]. I had already seen them 3 times at the point that I was skipping, but it was my boyfriend's first time seeing them, so I unknowingly skipped the majority of the earliest cutscenes for him until he brought up that they weren't playing all the way and I told him I'd been skipping mine. after I stopped skipping cutscenes, his played properly, so the issue was just me skipping

bridges were difficult to place; world gen was very strange and hard to work with; and no matter how many corners of the map I [i]did[/i] explore, a lot of things either never appeared or I simply never found them, which was quite a bit frustrating since I was trying to unlock everything I could to actually have a strategy other than ""rush to the portal, make everything hit it"" (which worked anyway, I broke most portals doing only that!)

also, at the moment there is no postgame save for the single free-LC thing and PVP. I'd prefer an infinite free play mode that encourages exploration and base building that maybe even incentivized cleaning up the nether everywhere, but instead my postgame was...a notification that never went away and whatever pop-up bases I didn't clear (and maybe a bunch of the Random Event village raids)
[spoiler]also the three spirits? aspects? whatever that summoned us to the world just completely disappeared from the Overworld in postgame, leaving me behind in the starting area scarred with nether so badly that all the flowers and animals were gone too, generally making me feel very awkward and lonely. is this supposed to feel rewarding? I feel punished...[/spoiler]

as someone who does not enjoy PVP and likes games I can dump thousands of hours into doing literally nothing, I would've liked a reason to do just that. but as it stands, this game has a very brief shelf life, and once you finish the story and free-LC, you likely won't have a reason to come back for a really long time if you also don't like PVP

there's no issue with a game being short or a game that's only meant to be played once, but Minecraft's spinoffs like Dungeons tend to have a lot of content and felt like they could be played infinitely. with that standard in mind, this game is lacking a lot

I also agree that there could be more units &ct added in the future. I understand why you used golems/humanoid mobs, but I'd like to see something like bats or goats get used too! the closest equivalent were llamas that you could rally for ranged shots, but you can't summon those on demand (which is also disappointing!)

5043,137000807.0,226620,"The completely random level construction method leads to a complete loss of control over the difficulty of the game.
Simply put, this game has a spell where after petrifying a small monster (without gaining experience), the next kill experience gains+50%. Monsters are classified into different levels, with lower level monsters having less experience and higher level monsters having more experience. So far, it is still normal.
However, first of all, the experience card of this game is very dead. You must use this spell multiple times to be at the same level as the boss, otherwise you will find yourself two or even three levels lower than the boss. Secondly, this game upgrade has a huge improvement in attributes. That is to say, if you are lower than the boss level, you will not be able to fight at all. If you cannot fight, you will have to run away. This cost benefit is equal to 0, and you will also lose the money you spent on buying things.
Then there is also a very treacherous situation. The initial map of this game is covered by the fog of war, and the character's health and mana are restored by exploring the map. If you don't hit the discovered monster, you will lose blood and mana. That means you can't plan your route at all, you can only rely on luck. Often, it's difficult to kill monsters in front of you, and a bunch of level 1 small monsters emerge from behind. Then, the remaining big monsters are generally one or two levels higher than you, and you can't beat them at all.
Having said so much, even the game's spell drops are random. Sometimes (a lot) you don't even have the experienced spell in the entire map, and you don't even have to gamble on luck. This map will definitely not pass, even if you open the entire map at the beginning and plan to pass, because you don't have enough level, you just can't win.

Furthermore, the mid-game performance goes completely to the toilet, for reasons I can't figure out. In other cases, the game lags with pathfinding when two gaters are waiting at the gate room and the third is making them wait because he still has to satisfy some need before they can leave.

Ravendock is a fun mix of Raft and Colony Sim. When you start the game, you're given the bare minimum - a dock and some planks - and are given the freedom to create what you'd like. It has a lot of depth. You can get to the point where everything is automated. There are areas to explore. NPCs to meet. Some colonists even come with specific passive that match their clothing. For example, one can show up wearing vegetables on her head which means she eats less.

You quickly get lost in this game. What was supposed to be a quick 20 to 30 minute session turned into nearly 4 hours quickly, and not a single moment full dull. Getting struck by lightning, fires, having to deal with the happiness of colonists, etc. There's always something that can be improved.

I'm excited for the future of Havendock.",1.0

5073,137004731.0,1457080,"More of a meh than a recommend or not. 

I was excited for this game to come out and the first couple hours I was feeling goooooooood. Game play was smooth and chaining around to different enemies while blasting off spells felt good. 

However this game somehow manages to overstay it's welcome, despite being only about 10-15 hours long. 

-The areas are cool at first but eventually just devolve into rooms of bad dudes that you gotta punch for too many rooms.
-The spell upgrade system is fun until you realize most spells are kinda useless and, while they look cool, are too mana inefficient and you're better off just blasting folks with the base spells until closer to end game. 
-There were several times where the game soft locked on me either due to a bug or because I was out of mana and a specific enemy type can only be damaged with spells, so with no way to kill the last enemy in a room and progress I had to quit out and start the level completely over again. 
-The mouse and keyboard controls are just bad. Playing with a controller feels much better. 
-Combat is almost smooth; a lot of times trying to launch cool combos then dash away like the magically badass you feel like doesn't always work. I found myself spamming the same quick combo all game and never really needing to move away from it since no enemy was able to adequately punish or force me to change tactics, even bosses. 
-Speaking of bosses, they're probably the best part of combat. They usually offer fun tests of game knowledge and reflexes. However, most of the later bosses have several stages, fine, but there's no indication of this so if you pop all your best spells and unchained mode early, you might end up wailing on them in a useless effort since they go invulnerable. That's fine, test the player, punish them sure. This is an issue because there's no skip cutscene button. So if you die on a boss, you have to sit through the entire dialog with them and then through all the stages, which usually aren't hard once you know their attack patterns. So instead of a fun challenge they sometimes just feel like their wasting your time as you slowly crawl towards progression. 
-The story is kinda, all over the place. Characters are cool but need some more room to breathe and develop. Due to the length of the game things happen one after the other and there's no sense of any story beats being earned. 
-The hideout growing as you recruit mages is super cool, to see it go from a rundown ruin to a bustling little town is super satisfying. There should be more perks attached to this system though, usually you just get upgrade materials, which are nice, but it feels like there should be more there. 

All that said, I don't think this is a bad game, just kind of a mediocre one. The core gameplay loop here it great, but unfortunately that's kind of it. For fans of the League universe like me, the lore and world building are the main draw. For non fans there's not much for you. 

The biggest issue and the reason for the negative review is the DLC. As a fan I thought I'd support the company by going for the deluxe edition since the Ruined King Deluxe offered some cool weapons that were references to League proper. For $10 this game locks a few spells (not even particularly good or impressive ones), a couple PNGs for your ""room"" (literally just set dressing, no interaction or anything), 3 palette swaps, and some bonus upgrade materials after each main story mission (which as I've said are kinda pointless since the game gives you more than enough to max out your character). So to increase the price 1/3 for literally nothing is gross. It reeks of Riot's money grubby meddling and it's a shame.",0.0

5088,137002921.0,1663220,"I rarely play games of the same saga one after the other, because I've found that they put me off a bit and I usually end up leaving the second title half finished, or I force myself to complete it. However, when I finished Coffee Talk and received the opportunity to play its sequel, I immersed myself once again, fully and without hesitation, to this fantastic universe so relaxed and jovial. I must say, being a narrative and enjoyable experience, I didn't feel that usual overwhelming feeling, and I'm very glad since both titles have been truly magnificent. 

Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly, is the second installment of this very special game that has touched many people since its release. It is a title that presents itself as a visual novel with simulation elements, putting us in the role of Barista (the main character whom we can name, and whom I will refer to as him for simplicity), owner of a very peculiar coffee shop that only operates at night, and which is frequented by creatures and people of all kinds. I will try not to repeat myself too much with respect to my previous review (from Coffee Talk 1), [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sieghiro/recommended/914800/]and I invite you to read it first just in case and to avoid any confusion![/url]

The [b]story[/b] follows the same pattern as in the first installment, being told as a set of stories that involve the various characters who visit the Coffee Talk café. On this occasion, we’ll be able to glimpse a little more about characters that previously did not have so much prominence, such as Jorji, the neighborhood policeman and proud father, who escapes from time to time to have a hot drink between his nightly patrol days. This gentleman will follow the trail of acts of vandalism against cars, and little by little will be involved in a couple of somewhat paranormal events that will make for a strange case.

On the other hand, new and curious individuals will make an appearance in our establishment, such as Lucas, a ‘satire’ influencer who focuses on trends, or Riona, a ‘banshee’ whose dream is to become an opera soprano. This particular duo is quite prevalent in the 'story', and among the new characters they are certainly my two favorites. Lucas is very charismatic, but has moments that filled me with tenderness, and Riona is somewhat shy and pessimistic, but will open up with us little by little. Among other new characters, there is also Neil's (an alien from the first game) sister who has come in search of her brother and to learn more about our race.

Other of our dear old customers will also have their moments, such as Lua and Bailey, the couple that against all odds has finally reached the path of planning their wedding; or Hyde, the vampire model who is already a bit bored with his job and is looking to broaden his horizons. These and many more stories are woven thanks to the atmosphere of our coffee shop, a special corner where people can feel at home, and we as Barista will be in charge of welcoming them and giving them warmth. We'll also be able to unveil some secrets and uncertainties that we were left with in the first installment, such as the origin of the Barista himself, which kept me in suspense on more than one occasion. It is, as in the first installment, a story full of interesting, comical and emotional situations, a tangle of very nice tales and that although they are set in fantasy, they feel very real. A narrative that captivated me yet again.

The [b]gameplay[/b] does not change much with respect to the previous title, we can continue reading and interacting with our customers by preparing them drinks in an enjoyable mini-game. However, we’ll have some variety that will keep things interesting, since we’ll have a new mechanic where we'll be presented with objects, whether by their owners' own will or not, and we'll have to return them or pass them on to those who need them. This must be done at the time of serving the drink, and on more than one occasion I have lost the opportunity to serve the coffee with the corresponding item next to it; I recommend not to follow my steps, and pay attention! Otherwise it will happen to you as it did to me, that at the end of the game I was told the following: ""you may have completed the story, but you have not appreciated all its nuances"".

Another thing that stands out a lot this time is the new repertoire of ingredients that we'll have at our disposal when creating new mixtures. In particular, we'll have hibiscus and anchan tea, spices that provide a very colorful aspect to the drinks we can prepare. Hibiscus gives a very lively reddish tinge, and anchan, on the other hand, creates a bluish coloration that conveys tranquility, and these details will be important when it comes to fulfilling orders; after all, these two herbs will be very popular among our clientele, so it is worth taking note of the drinks we create with these ingredients.

A detail that I didn't mention in my previous review, more out of absent-mindedness than anything else, is that depending on whether or not we get the drinks we are asked for, will be how the 'stories' of the characters end, in a good or bad ending, so to speak. It is something that curiously did not give me ""problems"" in the first game, but that is much more noticeable in this second installment, as it has more variety with respect to the arcs of each of them. Customers play more with your memory, asking you for drinks like ""the one you served me that day"", and sometimes... they even reference requests from the first installment, so evil!

In addition to coffee and recipes, we'll have a new function in our app ""Tomodachil"", in which we'll be able to see the 'stories' of our customers and leave them a 'like' if we want; it’s a simple detail I appreciate it, as it is entertaining to see what kind of interactions there are between the characters in this social network. Just as in real life, they disappear the next day, so you have to be attentive in case you don't want to miss one of them. Apart from that, we still have the recipe book, the music player app and the diary, although Freya no longer writes in it. It is not that there is a great revolution in gameplay, but I have been entertained as I was entertained in the first game, and that's what I find most important.

The [b]graphics[/b] are just like the previous one, a detailed and very beautiful pixel style. Some of the characters will have new aspects, such as hairstyles or clothing, and the environment is still that cozy coffee shop we are used to. I remember mentioning that I regretted not being able to glimpse those creatures passing by on the sidewalk, through the shop windows, and I am grateful that this time we could meet Lucas and Riona, these two new races and individuals who have a phenomenal style. The [b]soundtrack[/b] returns with a vengeance, boasting delightful songs of various rhythms; I noticed the occasional livelier one, such as a very fierce piano tune, but they still don't leave out the melodies that convey tranquility and relaxation. There is little I can say about this section, since I would be repeating myself too much in respect to my previous review, but I want to make it clear that it is still an excellent soundtrack.

In [b]conclusion[/b], Coffee Talk 2 ~ Hibiscus & Butterfly  is a second episode that, with a stronger than strong story, once again brings us all kinds of emotions between conversations and endearing characters. The strong point has always been its storytelling and the interactions between its clientele, and it's beautiful to be able to see the relationships that have formed between the characters that started as cafe acquaintances, to the point of calling each other family; and these moments touched me to the core. The gameplay did not lose its touch and added some other entertaining mechanics, and the audiovisual aspect maintains the impeccability of the first title. Totally recommended!",1.0

5094,137006833.0,226620,"[h1]Desktop Dungeons Review[/h1]

Desktop Dungeons is an addictive and challenging puzzle roguelike that offers a unique and rewarding experience for players who enjoy dungeon crawling, resource management, and strategy. From the moment you start playing, you'll find yourself drawn into a world of randomly generated dungeons filled with traps, monsters, and loot. Your goal is to defeat each dungeon's boss and bring back as much treasure as possible, while also upgrading your kingdom to unlock new classes, races, and items.

[h1]Mechanics[/h1]

One of the most impressive things about Desktop Dungeons is its gameplay mechanics. The game is turn-based, and each turn you make decisions that will impact your success or failure. You have to manage your resources carefully, including your health, mana, and inventory, as you explore each dungeon. Every step you take, every monster you fight, and every trap you trigger could mean the difference between victory and defeat.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The game is also incredibly challenging. Each dungeon is randomly generated, which means that you never know what to expect. Some dungeons are easier than others, but even the easiest ones can be tough if you're not careful. You have to think strategically and plan your moves carefully to survive.

[h1]Classes[/h1]

One of the great things about Desktop Dungeons is the way it rewards experimentation. There are dozens of classes and races to choose from, each with its own unique strengths and weaknesses. Some classes are better suited for certain dungeons than others, and some races have special abilities that can help you in specific situations. You'll need to experiment with different combinations of classes and races to find the best strategy for each dungeon.

[h1]Graphics & Sound Design[/h1]

The graphics and sound design in Desktop Dungeons are simple but effective. The game has a charming, retro-style aesthetic that is both nostalgic and modern. The music and sound effects are also well done, adding to the overall atmosphere of the game.

[h1]Overall Experience[/h1]

Overall, Desktop Dungeons is a fantastic game that is well worth your time and money and for this week when I am writing this review you can even get it for free. The gameplay is addictive and challenging, the mechanics are well thought out and balanced, and the graphics and sound design are top-notch. Whether you're a fan of roguelikes or just looking for a fun and engaging puzzle game, Desktop Dungeons is definitely worth checking out.",1.0
5095,137006629.0,226620,"I didn't find the few mechanics in this game satisfying.

It's a bit weird to be told you've lost the game on the first click, and [i]then[/i] be sent into a tutorial, which has overblown music like the world was about to end. The gameplay is like learning an awkward version of chess, as you have to consider each move carefully even if you're not near an enemy. Simply walking around the dungeon can mean you lose, even if nothing attacks you. As far as I've seen, the enemies are unable to attack you first, so the fighting is a bit flat.

I didn't like how the difficulty revolved around recycling all your items and trying to remember which tiles you already stepped on, because you only regenerate health (and recharge ranged attacks) by stepping on tiles that you've never stepped on before, so the healing potential is wasted if you step on them at full health. You need their healing potential to recover after fighting low level enemies so that you can level up to beat the dungeon boss. Part of the problem is that you can only see the tiles immediately around you (or ones you've already stepped on), so you can't even plan ahead - essentially soft-locking you if you don't end up strong enough to defeat the boss. You're more or less forced to buy ""preparations"" just to slightly increase your chance of winning, and get punished for experimenting with different strategies because the meta is narrow, and restarting costs you the preparations again.

As the meta involves pacing around the dungeon while counting the tiles like a mentalist, I didn't feel any immersion - the game breaks the fourth wall constantly which doesn't help, and fights just involve a mouse click or two. I thought there must be something fun about this game, but I don't get it. When exploring a dungeon I feel like I'm messing up an awkwardly made puzzle, and that's the entire game. I'd rather trade the intensity of picking your steps so carefully for the animating flow of a real-time strategy game. Why wouldn't I play something more fleshed out like Age of Empires 2? Even Celtic Kings had an RPG mode that felt more natural. For £11.99 it doesn't offer much in the way of mechanics, and seems game-breakingly difficult.",0.0

5097,137007031.0,1976950,"This is basically a modernized reboot of the original Desktop Dungeons with a few small changes. Which is fine, because the original game was already an incredible gane.

Desktop Dungeons is basically a dungeon crawl themed puzzle game where a fresh level 1 character is dropped into a dungeon and you have to carefully manage your resources to fight enemies and defeat the bosses at the end of the level. For instance, regeneration occurs when you uncover new parts of the map, so it's important to explore at a measured pace to avoid running out of health. You'll also need to keep track of items, glyphs and the whims of the various Gods within the game.

Lots of varied dungeons together with many different class and kin combinations leads to a lot of replayability. There are also a lot of puzzles and challenges that can really test your knowledge of the game systems, and a daily dungeon with a leaderboard.

One thing I'm not crazy about is that the new graphics make it a little harder to see what's going on with everything at a glance. However there are some interesting balance changes and some quality of life improvements that I can appreciate.

5106,137006490.0,1277230,"After some initial walking around/tutorial part the game becomes more like a 2d survival horror game, with enemies, weapons and health items. The enemies respawn if you leave and re-enter the room, but at least in the beginning, they can easily be killed in melee.
Bullets are very limited. Not in how many you find, but how many you can carry around. Sometimes it just makes more sense to avoid the enemies.
The art style is reminiscent of ""Don't Starve"", and the story pretty interesting so far.

I don't know about the whole ""pony"" thing, but I'm going to find out further down the road.

The game was kind of a Cube World style game with RPG elements and resource gathering. Now it became just a minigames kind of thing. Not exactly what I was waiting a year for.

Extremely disappointed.",0.0
5111,137006630.0,1922960,"Let’s address it straight away. The art style is without a doubt the biggest selling point to this game and rightly so. I mean it worked on me too. Using the classic Japanese ink painting aesthetic can’t help but stand out. And while I did have my concerns about how well this would translate on a more 3D plane, as soon as I took my first few steps, my concerns washed away. The disturbing monster designs, fog and mist elements bringing along all those weird and wonderful Silent Hill vibes are a more than welcome addition.

Put simply, gameplay wise it’s an old school D&D or Wizardry based dungeon crawler. You move your party around a map, jump into battle and use your limited options to best your foes. So those of you coming out of your 1990’s cryo chamber, you’ll be a little underwhelmed on the gameplay front. Don’t get me wrong, Labyrinth of Zangetsu does the basics incredibly well but most battles play out the same.

Also being an old school style game, the difficulty is right up there with the toughest of them. But only until after the second level. You’ll have crits a plenty go against you, wiping out your party members. You’ll then have to head back to the temple to resurrect them… well if you’re lucky. It costs a heavy chunk of change to do this in the early game so you’ll create new warriors to replace the higher level ones you lost to grind for cash… not in that way. But what is likely to happen, you get impatient and they die too. 

It’s incredibly tedious doing this but like I mentioned it doesn’t last long until you start tripping over weapons worth 1000’s of yen and amassing a small fortune. Also by this time, you’ll find you are becoming something of a small army, wasting the lesser cronies for fun. Fortunately the bosses and hidden enemies will put you back in your place if you decide to turn your brain off.

The story is another minimal aspect to the game. It’s essentially a go here, do this type of plot. I never really felt I had input in the story at any point, which is a shame. Oh and is it really to much to ask for an auto move feature? But enough of my moaning. I like to nitpick and some of these issues I spotted will irk other people too. 

Labyrinth of Zangetsu is a lot of fun. So much so that when I started playing it, I didn’t want to play anything else. Yes the loop of die, grind for cash, fail resurrection and grind for more cash again tedious at the start, the rest of the game is a highly enjoyable dungeon crawler. Easily worth picking up if you want to play something that looks and feels different to the standard JRPG.

Notes:
To change the order (or rows, front and back), the first three characters go to the front and last three to the back.
Music - while it matches the atmospheric, can be repetitive.
Magic is use based
You can identify items in the dungeon
Identifying always requires you to hold a key down (kind of annoying)
You cannot search the grid in front of you, only the grid you are directly in the direction you are facing (for example, if the floor is black, it can either be a trap or item and the only way to find out is to step on it)
No mouse control if you do not want to use a controller

Is that an issue? Fugg no. You'll have no issues with dying over and over as OTXO knows how to sink its teeth into you. Is it the stellar action? Could it be the banger OST? Call it a combination of both.

There are a few things to note however. Firstly, if you're not a fan of having to redo things until you get a good ending, you might get stuck in the game at a few points. Save scum is the way to go. Make sure you save frequently. Also I would like to mention that it feels like a lot of the character sprites could use some touching up. The game has amazing CG art, but once you see a good CG and then go back to seeing the character sprites, they feel a little... unfinished. I mostly got this feeling with Elle, as my first thought upon seeing her was ""dang her eyes are half of her head."" If you could model the sprites in a similar proportion to the CG pictures, I think it would work very well for the game in the long run. It's not all the characters though. I thought characters like Cassie, Iro, Eli, Fumi, Dorian, and even Iro's dad looked fine. But most others are just a bit funny looking. A few that come to mind are Elle, Quill, Bonnibel, and even Mio to an extent. Other than that though, I personally didn't have any other problems with the game.

5160,121323243.0,782250,"While I've only played the game for a couple of hours at the time of writing this review, there's a lot i have to say about it from just the first week alone. I will have this be a spoiler free review for those who care about the story. 

Firstly, this game requires a lot of saving, with only 60 save slots that will probably all be used immediately with all the overwhelming options at the start. Then with having 60 save slots, unless you're following a guide then you will save at least 10 times a day, there are 30 days in this game I believe, and then you find out you did something slightly wrong when it comes to setting up your character? You'll have to fully restart because at that point you've already saved over the file of that choice.

While the dates are nice and fun the save scumming kinda ruins them for players trying to end the date positively, with saving at a choice, picking every choice at that save to see the best one, and then picking the best one, it just gets repetitive and annoying. 

I've focused on enough of the negatives so let's discuss the positives.
The characters are some of the best I've seen in a western dating sim game although that could just be the 50+ hours I've spent playing Crush Crush talking.

I think the art is some of the best I've seen from Sad Panda Studios other than maybe the recent Phone Flings we've gotten on Crush Crush. 

All of the characters are fully voice acted, and personally I was fine with every performance in the game, with a few stand outs like any other game.

Overall I still liked the game even with the flaw of me saving 70 times in my first few hours of gameplay. I'd say if you just wanna have fun with it play it like you would any dating sim just with saving a little more regularly, and if you wanna get every achievement and such follow a guide.

Overall Review: 8.5/10

[hr][/hr] 
[b]In a nutshell, here is my gaming experience[/b]
I always play it for a while and then drop it - its mechanics are made black box, either intentionally or unintentionally, and there are always situations where it can be frustrating. In some cases, you even have to ask the developers directly to get an answer. 
[hr][/hr] 
[b]More detailed review[/b]
The game was bumped up from the original 40 bucks to 60 bucks, and I was expecting it to be a full upgrade from the previous generation, and that's not the case - its current state can only be described as a little bit of a fix.
[b]About WEGO turn-based system in FCSS[/b]
The WEGO turn-based system is not really a ""novelty"", it's just a freak patch - in fact, the so-called RTS has a minimum time granularity, the traditional turn-based system has a time granularity, and even our reality The world also has a minimal unit of time like Planck time. What modern computers have done is to reduce the time granularity of ""turns"" to what we consider ""real time"", and strictly speaking even the miniature personal computers we use are not a real time system! 
Some people find this very realistic, but I always felt that OnTarget Sims screwed it up when I thought about it more deeply. The length of the command cycle sometimes starts at tens of minutes, and you're telling me that my scout will do nothing but report to his superiors over the radio when he sees an entire Soviet regiment running towards it? But even if I set the standoff rule for it, it could only relocate when the enemy was at a certain distance, not to mention the risk of exposure due to close range movement.
I really hope Ontarget Sims would reconsider the way the Wego mechanic is Implemented in their next title. But also not like Armored brigade - a unit should be evading artillery fire out of its instincts, not having me, the commander, tell it where to hide!

[b]So here comes our next point, the realism of the game. [/b]
[u]
“In real life, commanders maneuver forces 2-levels down. That means a Battalion commander focuses on maneuvering platoons while a brigade commander is focused on maneuvering companies. There's a reason why this idea exists.” 
[/u]
This is a comment from a U.S. Army officer about FCSS. The same comment applies to Combat Mission, where we players play not as any commander, but as all the units on the battlefield! I have to refute one of FCSS's slogans - The player is definitely not playing as a brigade/battalion commander.
[u]Artillery: There is a lack of functionality. [/u]
the lack of ""suppression"" effect of artillery attacks means that they do not behave in the right way to kill soft parameters, when your artillery does not directly kill enemy units, the soft parameters of enemy units will not be affected in any way. For example, when my mechanized infantry and tanks launched an attack on the enemy in a town area at the same ti me I dumped hundreds of rounds of 122mm howitzers into the town. I believed they had been overwhelmed by my artillery barrage, but in fact they had not. They completely ignored my artillery barrage and wiped out my attacking forces with precision!
[u]Nasty stubborn design, especially for WP side. [/u]
Artillery and CAS lack illumination ammunition - this is important to the Warsaw Pact. Warsaw Pact knows that their NVG level is not as good as NATO, and therefore they intend to use a lot of artillery to turn the night into day. But not in the game, so in the current version, any night battle scenario is ""unfair"" for WP players
Most of the scenarios in the game have too many concentrated WP units and the game refuses to provide the option to split units, which may be explained by the theory in FM100-2-1, but again, FM100-2-1 does not state that a WP company must only expand within 500m! It also mentions that a WP company will spread out to 1000m or more in the following situations, such as defense. It would be foolish to refuse to allow a Warsaw Pact unit to deploy in a more suitable method.
[u]Too careless in some details[/u]
I know the developers have done a lot of research in some very detailed areas, such as the effect of the inverse temperature phenomenon on TI devices. But I find it hard to believe that FCSS has made these things ""reasonable"". For example, standoff relocate is supposed to be designed to allow units to maneuver to avoid threats, but why would they maneuver in the direction of the enemy? When it comes to SOP as a ""selling point"", the situation is even worse. For example, the default SOP for units in some scenarios is to relocate as soon as losses occur, which is designed to preserve a unit as much as possible, but why would a Soviet infantry company start fleeing in panic because they lost an infantry squad and left trenches they had dug in advance? And the AI doesn't change SOPs, which means that in these scenarios their units start fleeing as soon as they are lost, and I can't imagine how this can explained. these  absurd aspects of FCSS make it hard for me to say that FCSS is a rigorous wargame.

[b]UI/UX design is still terrible. [/b]
Although the UI art is much improved(I have to say this was a big factor in motivating me to buy FCSS on day one), the actual experience is not as good as I thought it would be. The first is the annoying map zoom, which is very sluggish and the shortcut keys are very counter-intuitive. The mouse wheel up zooms in instead of out, which can be changed in the settings, but I still find it very ridiculous, you guys haven't used the touchpad on your laptop? The direction of the mouse wheel can be changed, but other shortcuts do not offer the option to change it. For example, the new SOP menu shortcut is ctrl+k and the Los tool is ctrl+L, which is very inconvenient because I need two hands to press it! 
Another thing, Esc doesn't always close pop-up windows quickly, some windows can be closed quickly with Esc but some can't, which also annoys me a lot. 

[b]Bad AI design[/b]
Bad news for single player. FCSS’s AI is subpar, because it's almost indistinguishable from the AI of any other games that was probably designed over a decade ago - all it does is march towards the objectives set by the script designer and the only tactic used is to send all troops, both combat and support, through different paths to get within range of my tanks. And it seems to have no concept of long range engagement and tactical retreat, when the target area is blocked by my position, it will not stop, never. It will ignore casualties. Does this look like competent AI design? I can't tell any different from those old wargames. Where is the elaborate and cunning AI they promised?


Too many FKing DIALOGS
Having dialogs in wargame is not a problem, but there are TONS of them that I can't see the FKing map and have to get them out of the FKing way. Maybe I shouldn't have called FCSS an Excel simulator, because there aren't that many dialog boxes in Excel either.
Move unit? Have a dialog.
How fast you want? Have a dialog.
What to do in the end of the path? Have a dialog.
Want to resupply? Have a dialog. 
Plan a CAS strike? Have a dialog.
Game paused? Have a dialog.

After writing all this, I've pretty much written out all the negative feelings I've had while playing FCSS. I'm tired and upset, because six months ago I wasn't expecting such a mired-in development hell…man I don't want to buy the same game for the third time already…",0.0

5167,137007624.0,2350020,"A light and fun game that requires thinking and creativity. The game features an intricate crafting system that requires you to scavenge for different materials and combine them in unique ways to create tools, weapons, and even fortifications. This aspect of the game is incredibly satisfying as you feel like you are truly surviving in a world where an incredibly suspenseful and game that will keep you hooked from start to finish.

Every day a horde of people will invade your base and you must fight them to survive. These hordes are incredibly challenging and will test your skills as a player. The sound of the people approaching, the frantic gunshots and explosions, and the constant fear of death make these days a real experience.

Game felt like a walking simulator from 1 boss to another, thats the only good part of the game, the bosses, the rest is nothing, and 100% NOT worth the price tag.

5179,137010881.0,1457080,"I'm only going to mention the things I dislike about this game because everything else is perfect and you will not regert spending your money on this game

You lose access to your special moves (elite mages you bring to missions) when replaying missions

Wisteria is the most unenjoyable thing to face in this universe. They really need to nerf her teleport frequency and put more downtime after she uses heavy attacks. Playing boss fights super slow because they're almost untouchable is never fun.

Sylas feels useless when he's out of mana against enemies that are impervious to phsyical damage (usually the ones that don't have a spell to steal from)... and recharging mana from physical attacks takes soo long

Some ultimate spells are useless and don't have any meaningful applications in combat (Cataclysm, Divine Intervention)... 

There is a number of grammar/spelling issues in some lore pages and ability descriptions, they should revise everything and fix that for the next update

The Forge could use more content, you max everything out before you even finish half the game, it feels like incomplete content. 

Silverwing station in Deluxe Edition gives almost nothing and you max everything out in the games' shops with a lot of resources to spare without it. Feels like they just put that in the Deluxe edition to fill out space

Other than that, I'm really hopeful that Riot might consider investing in a DLC for this game in the Freljord where Sylas finds new allies. Or at least add more secondary missions because there were barely any. I'd love to see encounters with more relevant characters like Fiddlesticks, Evelynn and others hanging around Demacia",1.0

5185,137010574.0,1928870,"Buy this when it's on 50% sale. Been playing on single player campaign only. It's fun, and if you prefer to fortify your defenses first before taking actions, even at default difficulty, game becomes quite hard. 12 hours in I finally met my first boss. I had 4 layers of Stone Walls and 2 layers of basic towers. He came through them like hot knife through butter. The piglins that prefer to fortify their bases got to lvl 3 - the final stage - and I'm excited to how to destroy them. The game becomes very enjoyable once open world kicks in. 

But, I don't see this becoming something like the ""Next"" Minecraft. The gameplay style is very limited, and I can't see how you can improve this even with help of the modders. The game could become another level if building on top of existing structure was allowed, like Fortnite, but at this point, not much customization.  

I also played Multiplayer once, it was toxic. They disabled in-game chat and voice chat, but you can still feel it being toxic. No communication between teammates. Game started even before I hit ready (in fact, there's no way to be ""Ready."" Once you join you are up to host's decision to launch the game or not). The game I joined was already in progress and enemies were bombarding us from mountain. And I believe many other issues have been addressed by other players as well (such as friends in specific team or teammates destroying your building or teammates stealing your army, etc). If devs were trying to follow other games that don't have in-game chat allowed, please do more research that some of those games had system similar to sign language. (*cough* *cough* Meadow)

Certain vtubers said this game feels like ""Diablo for Kids."" Feels exactly same. If you are trying to decide whether to buy this game to play with your friends, or host your own server (again) to play different mod for Minecraft, go with later option. Even if they fix multiple things in next few patches, with 8 player max in multiplayer (4 of them being your enemies), you are not going far with this game. 

TL;DR: they tried to simplify things. They have overdone it.",0.0

Fire and Maneuver was and felt like a strategy game I have played before. Yet, starting the game up I was very confused about the controls and how to play the game properly. 

Even after looking at tutorials and trying to learn the basics I was frustrated and uninstalled the game. But, yet something about the game made me curious to try it again and again. It started to become alluring to try it again, and following more updates to the game I had started to finally the amount of depth that the game has to offer in its campaigns. Extraordinarily scope of historical units and conflicts that I believe are not truly covered in the mainstream media ( Looking at the Crimean War). 

The Armchair History Interactive retains its original concept of a strategy game like no other one before it. A game filled to the brim with history and hours' worth of content that can keep you entertained and working on your skills as a general for a long time.

Second is that the shield needs to be activated, and then assigned to an armor set...

5214,129204547.0,1939940,"Bought this game for $17.49 cdn just recently, so I'm playing the latest patch (Dec 2022).  Never played the physical game before, but I like dice games so I gave this a go.  Good game.  Played for 17 hours according to the tracker and I think I'm done.  I'll see how the game's DLC are in 2023 if I get back into it.  Here's my view playing solo.

- Overall a good simple game.  Dont think it's worth that given I've had more fun in other games for half the price, but it is early access.  So cant expect 50% off sales anytime soon

- Well polished.  Didn't have one crash, everyone moves swiftly.  Everything works

- Graphics are simple flash/mobile quality.  Clean, but dont expect miracles

- Sound is repetitive and the Music slider works oddly.  Unless you make it 10%, it always seems loud and barely goes down in volume.  Go from 90% to 40% and the sound barely changes

- UI works smooth, but the button placement is bad.  You got green button prompts which are relatively small and put in different corners of the screen at different times.  A waste of space and unneeded mouse moving.  There's also 1-2 too many mouse clicks needed to get through a round.  The profile button on the home page (a white silhouette) is way out there too.  You wont even notice it at first, but that's where your stats and leaderboards are

- The game has a slew of race and classes which have different bonuses, minuses and stat thresholds to meet.  It is flawed as some are way better than others.  Monk and Druid and Warrior seem the best IMO by a lot.  Unless I'm doing something wrong, some race/class combos cant even reach the threshold.  So if a Monk needs minimum 18 strength (6, 6, 6) for that row to score pts, and a faerie girl starts with Strength -2, her max is really 16.  So you can't reach it unless I'm messing up

- It's based on a card game.  The game itself is fine.  Nothing spectacular.  It's basically rolling dice trying to score pts on fulfilling objectives and picking and paying for cards to help your goal.  The RPG character creation setting fits perfectly

- It's a nice swift moving game.  If you're having a crap game or want to start over, there's an Abort Game option.  Starting a fresh game is fast.  You can pick your race (or randomized choice), but the class and attribute and alignment cards are random

- Not a hard game to understand.  Hitting 38 pts or more (best rated achievement) is pretty tough to do but I did it before my 10th game.  You'll probably get a lot of 28-35 scores.  I hit 40 pts once and I maxed out everything with a good assortment of item bonuses to boot.  I don't know what the max score is, but it's probably no more than 50?  At this point, once you hit 38 pts top tier, your goal is trying to beat it and get as high as possible

- The stats leaderboard in the profile button is good.  It shows your top scores, avg scores, race/class usage etc...  A handful of good charts for numbers geeks",1.0

Zoeti is a Roguelite/Deckbuilding game.

You know this games of deckbuilding with lack of a good smooth gameplay like slay the spire has? Well, this one has better smooth gameplay than slay the spire and I love it.

First of all you don't need know the rules of poker for understand this game.

They apply the rules of poker as 8 diferent ways for attacks, for example one pair (1 card) = A and B type of atacks or defend which each  one you can level up for do more dmg/shield; two pair (2 cards) = C and B type of atacks.

Very easy to understand, the tutorial helps a lot.

The game also focus on a good narrative story but you can skip the dialogues if you only want this game for the gameplay.

There is also a roguelite part where there are unlocks and lvl up of your character, but nothing that you didn't see in another games of the same genre.",1.0

5225,137010904.0,1434540,"Buy it, love it, play it forever. A beautiful game that rides on a well-polished track of game mechanics that I could play for just one more run... forever.

The core gameplay of Zoeti is drawing from a deck of cards and using card combinations to activate abilities and fight your enemies. As you progress each run, you'll learn new skills and upgrade previous ones, collect artifacts that boost your abilities when certain conditions are met, acquire character skills that drastically affect your gameplay choices, and gain consumable items to compliment your ever-expanding kit. Mechanically the game is incredibly solid, and the fundamentals build with each new chapter and each difficulty, increasing your options but also increasing the complexity of how you can play most effectively.

Pass or fail, each run rewards you with experience points that unlock new abilities, relics, and items to find in your next playthroughs, as well as two unlockable characters with different card pools. Passing a chapter means you can try again on the next highest difficulty, leading from Normal to Hard, Horrific, Nightmare, and finally Inferno.

While I found the story and world-building to be inconsequential, the art style and production make the game undeniably attractive. All of the characters are beautifully drawn and are presented with distinct characteristics, even if their situations can be a little bland. The character design (humans and animalkin) as well as the basic monsters provide a more than substantial backdrop to the game, but never once did it impede or overshadow the smooth beauty of the card mechanics and ability combinations.

I would buy this game for a friend if they seemed even the slightest, little bit interested, knowing full well they'd get pleasantly sucked in just like I did.

The game is just plain fun to play. I enjoy the various strategizing elements that are centered/based on the RNG of the dice and what you can get from the market.

The developers recently pushed out an update that added in AI opponents, which appears to have addressed the main critique of the game (from what I've read). From my limited games against them, they appeared competent and well implemented.

The invasions being a problem as it takes 2 guards to take down one invader. Meaning you lose generators and the guards either die before getting to a bed or spend a month or more being constantly treated.

The planets you visit seem to rarely have any specimens on them. Meaning you cannot write any new patents for income.
Doctors walk off somewhere else rather than heal people. Also I have 3 people on hospital beds that have been treat 40+ time and over three months ingame. And they still have mental damage/insanity. Thats my best engineers unable to mine.

5252,137013856.0,1928870,"When this game was announced, I brushed it off... but upon watching some of the pre-launch promotion, I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised.

This game blends elements from RTS's like Age of Empires and MOBAs like League of Legends and DOTA. While it leans a little heavier into the RTS side, it's a really interesting spin on the genre. While like any RTS, it's a bit overwhelming to learn all the units, upgrades and buildings at first, it is much more approachable than most games of its genre. 

I've most enjoyed the versus mode (PvP). Forming private lobbies with friends works great and the game is remarkably balanced. It feels like everything has a counterplay despite the relatively small unit variety. Public PvP DOES have a critical bug preventing you from forming premade teams with your friends, but they've acknowledged that they're working on fixing that ASAP. 

As for the price tag... I'll admit, it's a LITTLE high. If they'd knocked $10-$20 off of it I would be more accepting, but $40 ($50 Canadian) is a lot for what the game currently has to offer... that said, I AM enjoying it a lot and will continue to play the versus mode.

Labyrinth of Zangetsu is a celebration of traditionalism. It’s art, it’s story, and its gameplay all harken back to a mythologized Japan of old; both with its ink-infused hand brush style and its ‘dudes in a line’ first person dungeon crawling RPG gameplay. And that’s also why it’s not exactly a surprising game. 

It’s rigid adherence to its yesteryear throwback style ensures that what you see is what you get; and it’s the same intense difficulty that had me pulling my hair out when I overplayed my hand and got wiped in the labyrinth is also the source of the profound relief I experienced when I leveled up and got a new tier of cleric spells.

It’s not going to convert anyone that doesn’t already have a fondness for the genre, but its clean and simple execution of its classic tenants are reminder of why they're classic in the first place.

Candidly this is probably a little closer to a first impression than it is a review; I’m about 7 hours and 4 dungeons deep, which the UI suggests is maybe about halfway through the game. If you’re looking for an end game analysis that’s something I can’t give, yet I enjoyed what I played and wanted to spotlight the game regardless.

Because Labyrinth of Zangetsu is as dungeon RPG-y as it gets, and it manages to do so much with so little. Simple alternations between stocking up in town and going back out for another expedition serve as your traditional flow; but what wasn’t there was any sort of risk reward mechanic to disincentivize flipping back and forth between them at whim.

When you get stuck in Labyrinth of Zangetsu, one of the best plays you can make is just to stay near the dungeons entrance, farm some early mobs then go back to town and heal up for free. That’s the kind of old school we’re working with and it’s also something that will morph from a cheesy tactic to an integral strategy because of the challenging enemy mobs and the high stakes that come with dying to them.

A team death in the labyrinth is effectively permanent with the caveat that corpses and items can be retrieved by a future party; but good luck getting there again without everything you’ve lost… You’ll have to resort to going back to base and recruiting a whole new party, one you’ll create with stat rolls, race and class selection, and even picking from a small list of portraits that hopefully looks like whatever fighter you’ve envisioned for yourself.

Even if this plucky young group of novice warriors are able to grab the corpses: the resurrect mechanic is as last century as it gets. You pay a ton of gold and roll some invisible dice so that half the time the game just laughs in your face, takes your money, and leaves the corpse lifeless anyway.

It’s why Zangetsu is a game of incremental advantages and slow, grindy gains… but there are some obvious modernizations that poke through some of its old school trappings.

Smart UI elements like icons that display when you have equippable gear being unused and an ‘auto-redo-last-turn-button’ help reduce some of the input quantity you might expect traditionally. Which is also why its so weird that some other parts of the game don’t have improvements like that: the chests that enemies drop on death need to be inspected, disarmed, and opened with multiple different inputs governing each. That goes double for the later chests that have multiple traps on them; a test to ensure you’ve got your parties stat distribution correct for sure, but maybe a little too frequent for how time consuming they are to open.

You may also be surprised how non-labarynthine Labyrinth of Zangetsu is; because despite the name, exploration is a component but not the primary focus. Both a mini-and macro map that auto-fill out details as you move around make most of the pathfinding trivial compared to some of its genre contemporaries.

Instead, the lion's share of your time will be spent engaging with and taking down the various enemies. A front and backline party formation will have you hiding your mages behind as beefy a wall you can make and letting them blast away, and limited spell usage per run will have you fleeing back to town when you’re exhausted.

Labyrinth of Zangetsu knows this and embraces it. The small list of conventionally ‘modern’ features the game boasts are largely UI concessions to help it be more playable with a controller, and it manages to introduce them without declawing the game entirely.

For better or worse this old-school romp is unconcerned with broad appeal; and that uncompromising attitude was as much a source of frustration as it was fun. But its no-nonsense approach to the dungeon RPG formula was simple if not easy, and make it a great pick up-n-play steam deck or switch experience rather than the longer term commitment that some of its peers are.

It wears its heart on its parchment; so much so that any one idle screenshot almost entirely conveys everything that this game is about. But just like its traditional-ink focused art style, Zangetsu finds beauty in what’s old… just don’t forget that sometimes that means clicking a dozen prompts to open one chest.

[FPS] 往年のDOS版FPS黄金期ゲーム達のリスペクトが随所に散りばめられている。DOOM～buildエンジンあたりを幅広く網羅しており、その元ネタを探す（思い出す？）だけでも楽しすぎる。可愛い地雷系ちゃんを操作し、射撃と近接、ダッシュを使い分けながらテンポ良く進んでいこう。敵を倒さないと魔力を吸収できずすぐに死んでしまうので、否応なしに敵（＝エサ）を求めて先に進むことになるがこれがまたテンポ良い展開を提供してくれる。各エリア突破時にはランダムなパワーアップを取得できる要素もあり、また難易度も幅広いのでリプレイ性も高い。ステージラストにはエモいボス戦もある。あの頃のFPSを楽しんだ人ならこの価格であれば十二分以上に楽しめること請け合いである。

This Game is very light on the Incremental and Idle aspect but that definitely does not take away from it. seeing a Roadmap of future updates or very responsive updates/fixes (this game isnt buggy tho) would definitely make me more comfortable spending 10$ on the game. Also a Coop feature would be amazing but I see that being complicated with the very limited layout of the Base Foundation. Its a Very good time and its relatively quick. I'd recommend taking your time with playing and trying multiple builds as that is where the experimentation comes from! Over 15 Hours in the game for me btw,1.0

5292,137015682.0,1621990,"Stray Blade is an adventure game with souls-like elements. But that description doesnt describe the way the game is. I will go into a few of the main aspects of the game and give the good and the ugly about it.

 Combat:
-The game has a parry, a dodge and with certain weapons a block. Perfect parries stagger an enemy for a second, deal poise damage and give back stamina. Parrying at just the wrong time blocks the damage, but doesnt stagger the enemy and leaves you open to a second attack. Just like parrying, perfect dodging recovers you some stamina but doesnt stagger enemies. And blocking is well... blocking. 
-The combat can feel clunky at times due to its unforgiving damage and stagger when you dont perfect dodge or parry and the stamina economy also requires you to do perfect parries and dodges. Some weapons have slow attack combos and dont have enough hyper armor, nor can you increase your poise like in a Fromsoft game. It takes some getting used to but eventually the flow of combat will become more of a dance then a battle. If you can find the patience for it that is.
-The abilities you unlock troughout the game (Intium, Manninite and Xhinnon) have their own uses in combat, Intium is fun, Manninite seems fun but doesnt do enough to make it worth it and Xhinnon turns on easy-mode.

Story:
-The story is pretty good if you read all the extra lorestones you can find around the game and talk to Boji whenever you can. Without the lorestones and Boji the story does become confusing, and the ending becomes very confusing and a bit weird.
-The valley of Acrea is very rich in its culture and history, and you can find out quite a bit about how the society was before their fall. Many areas have interesting tid bits of lore regarding them. The valley also looks very pretty.

Exploration:
-The exploration is this game is quite fun and reminds me of metroidvanias. You go trough an area, see some stuff you dont have the ability to get and come back later to find some nice customizations or other secrets. 
-The world as noted before looks great and each new area is great to look at and run around in. 

Performance:
-I ran the game on high settings on a 3070, Intel I-7 10700k with 16GB ram. I only noticed minor performance issues in certain areas. (Have to go back and check the areas again to give acurate and recent statistics on this since my info on this is outdated)

Final Thoughts:
Stray Blade is a good game that I am going to be replaying a handful of times with some fun challenges for myself. There are aspects that could be better or design choices that couldve been made differently but looking at the game as a whole its 100% been a blast and I cant wait to see what the future brings to this game.

For me, the determining factor will be if this dev or devs actually continue updating this game and making the AI better and also doing things like improving the absolutely terrible AI that we see here at launch today.  ..Most indie devs of games just like this over the years quickly give up and abandon their survival games as we've seen at least a thousand times before.  I have and see NO reason to believe that the dev(s) of this heavily asset reliant survival game will do any better.  ..Time will tell, but this is a ""NOT RECOMMEND"" for me until I see proof that this game is going to actually be supported by the dev(s) are are quick to try making $$ on it with the early access launch today.

NOT RECOMMENDED... because the AI is terrible and the game is NOT optimized at all and this game really adds nothing new to the already over-saturated survival game genre here on Steam.

5301,137016067.0,2320910,"(Reviewed on Index with RTX 3080)

As a person who quite recently finished the original game, I was looking forward for this port. That being said, I was ALSO VERY, [b] VERY [/b]  afraid. Usually VR ports are.... mediocre at best. However, I was very pleasantly surprised.

I am absolutely digging the control scheme, it's awesome! It feels great, you are really inside the game, it isn't annoying or a chore to play, the flow feels very natural and I can see that they must've put a lot of effort in tweaking it all. The art direction feels ""different"" (in a good way) when you're actually inside the game, you have to compare it yourself. You can feel the damage of the weapons, the recoil, the swings, the enemies look great and overall the game feels really nice. Had some issues at first with the game being laggy and dropping frames, but I just clicked the video settings a bunch and it's completely ok now (Epic settings 120Hz). Usually, I am very critical of VR games (mainly because I am already spoiled by the good ones out there) but god damn, for 20€ this game is a steal.

Of course, there are minor issues, like me clipping through a wall, teary animations on enemies, not being able to throw the axe on Index (or it's veeeeeeeeeeery finicky) or unpickable mana from time to time... yea they are the annoying thorn in the eye, but man!

The plot is really strange and atmospheric. I haven't looked all over here yet, but I've already found a lot of easter eggs. At the end of the chapter there is a form for voting and writing ideas. As I understand it, the developers will take the best ideas and implement them in chapter 2. But there is also a DAO, so I hope my idea gets into the game.
I liked the riddles - they are kind of abstract. They hint at something, have a deep meaning, but the developers will apparently keep the intrigue until the next episodes. Laughed since the bug in the jar. In general, an unusual game, even just to walk around this apartment. There's something about it.

I really had hoped that it would feel more like Stargate but instead I feel like the guy stuck behind watching the gate room.  This is still early access so I have hopes that more interaction with the gate teams will be added to give it more of that Stargate feel.

The game runs fairly smooth except for a static sounding glitch that happens.  Has not caused my game to crash yet but is very annoying when it happens.  Easily fixed by restarting the game.  While I love not having to micro manage all the residents of the base, they tend to be pretty mindless with medics choosing to go workout & such instead of healing the room full of injured people in the med bay.  The biggest issue I ran into was a balance issue where my income from patents seemed to slowly expire faster than I could get the material to create new ones leaving me slowly going broke.

Overall I love the Stargate feel, being able to build a base and create teams to send out on missions.

It's kinda like minecraft, terraria and bunch of other stuff in one.

I understand you launched an indie title with a new company, but you also need to realize that asking 35EUR for a game is not lunch money.

- The game froze, twice
- UI elements keep sticking to screen space even after menus are closed out
- UI design is basically prototype level bad
- Enemies keep transitioning back into their idle animation in the middle of the fight
- Input being dropped

The art was awesome, the hiding mechanics were interesting. I thought the character design of the enemies was great, and I had a great time playing. I did find a couple bugs during my play through (though as a speed runner i am not complaining. the WR will be mine!), that I've listed below for you. 

1. the book ramp towards the beginning makes you slide down, or halts movement if you get in between them. 
2. If you are moving on multiple planes of movement, Ie. holding W and A or D at the same time, while pointing your camera at a 45 degree from where you want to move, you can move significantly faster. This makes many impossible jumps  possible, and I dont think it was intended. I also quite enjoy seeing the silly rat go very very quick. 
3. After you beat the game, you can still press continue from the main menu. This spawns you in near the final cauldron with all of the ingredients respawned. It doesn't seem like the cauldron final scene has a check for if you have collected the ingredients already in this state. This allows you to instantly run to the end and watch the final cut scene again. Which is awesome, cause its a great cut scene (not so good for my speedrunnin times tho!!)

A few quick and easy recommendations for the DEVS:
Have the shadows set lower on first boot.  They are way too demanding to be defaulted to Epic.
Option to rotate health bars 90 degrees.  I feel it is more natural to do a ""check the time"" motion rather than a ""I come in peace""
I find that activating the soul power always triggers when I don't want it to.  For example, when shooting enemies up on a ledge, I have my hand raised to aim and it activates.  Perhaps add an option to raise both hands to activate.
The shadows on the torches with a floor stand on the first stage have a broken shadow issue.  No adjustment of the settings helped.
I also noticed I was dropping weapon with the Index.  Needs some adjustment.
The angular velocity is fine but the distance required to activate the green sword needs to be increased way more.  I was constantly setting it off just moving around.

Then an issue I had while adjusting the Effects in settings.  The menu pointer disappeared and then maybe also aim as detached from hand and got set to my HMD look.  I don't know if the second issue was caused at the same time.

Otherwise, they did a FANTASTIC job porting this.  I am going to enjoy this very much.

5345,137018281.0,2320910,"For the last few days I have been working really hard on a review for this game because frankly, it's great and it deserves a very detailed thought-out review. Thanks to some audio issues though I will have to start from scratch (issue from my headset, not the game) so I figured the least I could do until then is post a quick review here.

The first time I hopped into Amid Evil Vr I wasn't sure what to think but I quickly realized this was one of my new favorite games. The thing about VR is games is they are always trying to imitate real life but when that real life isn't imitated, the immersion is broken. Amid Evil Vr on the other-hand, is not imitating real life but instead what it would be like to live inside of a retro video game as a warrior and at that, it does an incredible job. I felt as if I were Wreck-It Ralph, but infinitely more badass.

I rarely just flat-out recommend a game, I will always say something like ""if you like this genre or style of game-play then this game might be for you"" but Amid Evil Vr I stand behind 100%.

This is a really interesting space-based roguelike where you control a single craft out to find a MacGuffin that can stop a star collapsing. You get 1000 turns to do this.

Most of the traditional roguelike trappings are here -turn-based gameplay, high difficulty, permadeath, procedural generation etc., but what really sets this game apart is the combat.

All the combat entities are effected by what is basically Newtonian physics. This means that you can't turn on a dime because spaceships have inertia they need to overcome before they can turn. Depending on how fast you are going it may take several turns to stop and turn around. This means that you have to carefully plan out your encounters, not just out-gunning and out-thinking your opponents, but out maneuvering them as well. Your ship has multiple mount points, facing forwards, and facing port and starboard. All this coalesces into an experience that is more than the sum of it's parts. In an carefully upgraded craft you can feasibly fight several opponents at once if you are smart about it, and pulling it off is extremely satisfying (and hard as nails).

Depending on how you have upgraded your ship in a given run the game can play out in vastly different ways. You really have to get a feel of what your current ship is capable of if you are going to win fights. Are you a heavy cruiser with tons of shields and armour that moves one tile at a time lighting the fuck up out of everyone in your wake, or are you a nimble fighter craft - darting in and out of the fray before the enemy has a chance to respond? 

It's all valid, all comes with tradeoffs, and is also out there for you to fight.

The game takes place on a 5x5 galaxy map, where each sector on the grid is a procedurally generated star system, with planets, anomalies, enemies, stations you can trade with and repair at, and even black holes. You can jump between these systems at will (assumming your hyperdrive is charged) gathering intel, earning credits, and getting into fights.

The game is a little content light at present. I haven't had a successful run yet, but I feel like I'm close. But it's fun - the combat is really unique, has excellent emergent elements to it, and is far deeper than it first seems. It's one of those systems where small additions can open up incredibly wide new possibility spaces, so I hope the devs add more stuff.

This game is kind of a dud.

There is a fuckton of pop up menus and microtransaction currencies that they hit you over the head with every time you are not in a race.

The battle pass items and stats boosts are obnoxious, it takes away from the gameplay. Often times I would just be wondering if my opponents just had better raw stats cause they bought the battle pass or some MTX that gave them an advantage. I am not saying they did but I am saying that the fact that it exists means I cannot eliminate from possibility or my mind and that partly ruins the enjoyment of the gameplay for me. 

All of the music has these weird nobody asked for remixes. Some are alright but the majority stand out in a bad way.

The gameplay is the best thing this game has to offer but I don't feel like its good enough to look past most of the junk. Kinda felt souless but a higher quality souless as if a lot of money was spend on testing and making this game based on trends and market research but not heart, passion or originality.

I expected the game to take place after Sylas comes back from the Freljor. To be honest after this ending, I dont really expect him to go to the freljords then burn down the rest of Demacia. So idk how the lore is gonna explain that part. He doesnt seem that bloodthirsty anymore.

",1.0
5370,137021412.0,1681060,"The game offers pretty solid experience, it is clearly driven by Evil Genius mechanic with added Stargate concepts. In current state there are quite some issues which will likely prevent you from reaching late game content (which I've personally reached only after finding and abusing bug that yielded millions of credits (pretty much infinite) and were able to exclude botched mechanic of patents from my game experience.
What went well:
Game concept and idea
Overall game experience
Stories behind the gates are pretty fun and diverse
Base building mechanics are pretty solid as is
Tutorials are mostly sufficient

Things  that was bad:
> Financial system is a total mess (patent mechanic needs full review - as from game design perspective it is using finite resource to give temporary gains, and these gains are highly random which results in inevitable collapse
> Increasingly complex waves of intruders require constant staffing with soldiers, medics don't have enough time to heal them between waves some times
> Doors doesn't block the intruders eliminating the possibility of creating kill-boxes in Evil Genius style
> Final monthly report hits twice sometimes (patent expire quicker, if you are negative on profits you go downward quicker, popular topics/positions to hire made useless in this case)
Patent mechanic as a main and almost single source of profit
> Selling material (and you can sell only one of them) is not a viable long term solution as of its randomness and it doesn't even cover up the salaries for the team of engineers - solution: allow selling all materials or increase costs greatly, or remove salaries at all - pivoting the concept of profit making into since expedition is a point for brainstorming
> According to time pace, it takes around 6-12 hours for a person to traverse the base, 4 hours to eat etc. The time pace and movement needs to be reviewed prior to release
> Pause doesn't pause, yes you've read it right - some people randomly continue walking and doing their job during game pause
>  Mechanic of influence is useless, it just doesn't add anything to the game, capturing sentient sectors only yield interesting series of missions, ultimately - nothing else
> RPG mechanic of the people you hire make very painful the case of their death or flee due to missed salary
as opposed to Evil Genius where each person is dispensable, making them less eager to flee due to salary is a possible solution
> Salaries (which are useless from my standpoint) are capped on the moment of hire, and there is no reason of looking for more expensive people as they are progressing their stats pretty quickly
> There should be some additional way to level soldiers on base and scholars as they progress way slower then Scientists (through patents and missions), Engineers (through repetitive missions)

Recommendations for developers:
> Introduce sustainable way to utilize scientists for new hypothesis (starting from lvl1 as later in game low level scientists are nearly useless)
> Remove expiry dates from patents, initiative should be developing over time, you can add diminishing effects on individual categories, this way you will be able to softly limit the income and for example update its condition after reaching certain story milestones, for example: first aliens met, foundry built (and engineers available) - new way of gaining profit introduced, invasions started(quick growth required to survive) - this will fix most issues with financial system
> Reduce salaries or increase profits from patents (leaving common as is, but gradually buffing usage of uncommon+ hypothesis will solve another financial problem - there is not much financial difference between using Legendary or Common (2-4x) while obtaining them is much much harder(15-20x) including all the random factors reducing the difference between complexity and profit will solve the issue. Consider leaving legendary hypothesis for some scenario based decisions (correct team set up or proper rolls success during missions)
> Reduce the time that squad is entering the gate, this is main bottleneck in a late game experience and frequently resulting in a deadlocking order queue and people infinitely waiting to enter the gate
> Reduce the price of zones as it pushes player to only cover the room with a proper zone under the facilities and ignoring the walking space, which make the room look much uglier (consider utilizing same mechanic as in EG - room can be removed as whole) and selling facilities less punishing (for example 0.8 of price instead of 0.5)
> Simplify the Training room research tree to two milestones instead of first major and adding all the other facilities through individual researches
> Reduce the price for research of autonomous intensive care unit
> Add warnings for upcoming removal of initial funding(50k per month), I've only noticed the number of remaining months in a second playthrough after first one got ruined the moment it happened
> Consider adding some loans and make the financial bankruptcy less punishing, the game ultimately shouldn't be about the money. From my perspective it should revolve around discovery, stories and scenarios behind the gates, alien relations, base management, fight for survival (recall the original Stargate) - the finances should be a background thing and have much less impact on game mechanics and story - in real life science is mostly non profitable except rare cases when individual discoveries yield billions and change the humanity life forever - exogate should be one of this kind of discoveries, as well as all the discoveries made behind the gates, the patent for these shouldn't individually be barely covering the salary of a single person.

Lower priority recommendations to consider:
> Tweak combat mechanics, it is way too clumsy now, but it is not a major factor for the game experience so may be left as is
> Add some wall of honor for fallen people
> Add decorations
> Add incidents (fire/flooding/toxic gas etc.) and cope mechanisms to improve on base management mechanics",1.0

The gameplay is rather fun despite my lack of knowledge in the genre and feels extremely replayable due to the different playstyles of combat versus movement. The auto mapper took a little getting used to initially but the ""gaps"" and ""lulls"" that people may be describing (IMO) are there to give notable windows where ur options for combat/movement are limited, thus forcing u into decisions and giving the game some skill expression that I enjoyed. On the other hand there are moments (from custom imported songs) where I tested the song with AutoDetect and then again with the precise BPM added and the auto mapper wasn't too horribly different, giving this game a credit to the amount of different experiences one can have with a practically unlimited library. 

I am very excited to see how this game's lifespan goes as with more maps and characters to play as the sky is pretty much the limit. To touch on the different types of maps for a moment, the difficulties associated seem to follow the difficulty of the terrain itself of the map and the Enemy / Boss types. The song itself doesn't define difficulty which I feel works because the way the maps and enemies are designed and vary, it seems skill expression will be more about rhythmic knowledge and  enemy management, not just whether or not u can hit the notes on beat. This makes grinding high scores or learning new songs pretty fresh and will continue to keep the game fresh as maps and characters are released. 

Definitely give this game a shot if you love music and/or shooters because it is a largely polished, with crisp and fast paced gameplay and lots of potential to grow.",1.0

Calling it fast-paced just feels like a complete and utter underestimate of how fast things really are considering that the game's core even revolves around managing a focus meter to slow the game down and make it more manageable. You're rewarded for going fast and killing enemies in ""interesting ways"" to get more coins, which are then used on buying drinks at the bar, this games perk/item system, or unlocking new drinks for it to offer you.

As focus has to regenerate, you only have so much to play with if you want to go fast. Due to that you'll want to mostly toggle it on and off quickly, just enough to get the drop on the enemies. This constant fast-slow-fast-slow made me feel more disoriented than anything else and after I failed my 2nd run, I moved to refund it as the game wants me to play faster than I find enjoyable while also just making me feel borderline nauseous.

Another issue is that there were no options to change the resolution or to swap between fullscreen and windowed. Furthermore, when I tried to change the keyboard bindings for the focus button, shift is uncomfortable for me to use as my pinky is somewhat numb, most of my alternate binds came up as ""undefined"". Alt, Ctrl and all of the numpad keys weren't being accepted.

On a plus side, the soundtrack, what I heard of it, sounded great and the guns themselves also felt satisfying to use.

I'm sure the game is plenty enjoyable if you enjoy games that move at the pace of an enthusiastic tourist during their first time on a German Autobahn, but if you're like me, the one who'd be in the passenger seat clawing at the upholstery, legs straight and pushing against the two break pedals they wish were there with all the might they can muster in a vain attempt to stop the madness they're being subjected to, I'd say give this one a pass.",0.0

Story: Learning of the Valley of legend, you see Farren journey to the land of acrea, But due to something happening, Farren meets boji, a wolf turned human, he is your companion,and guide.

Combat: When you first get into Stray blade the combat feels clunky, Until you get some skills unlocked some movement,and additional attacks, and also when you get more weapons, and armors, yes armors, as in more than one outfit, which are found in chest and etc.

Music: The amazing soundtrack sounds so good from the rise of the strings to the brass coming in, i love the music,

Sound Design: Ngl some of the sounds like someone beating a metal drum with a heavy hammer, but the sounds of the bows being fired, the fire crackling, to the sound of the forge and the hammer and tongs.

Enemy design: I love the variety of the enemy's, but man some of there parry windows are rough. But once you learn, the elites are tough, and they can tank the damage.

The three rulers of Acrea in your quest to beat them, you find new weapons, and abiltys to aid you in your quest,

story: 5/10 but thats ok since it isnt realy a story driven game
gameplay 8/10 runs properly a little lagspike here and there but thats something mostlikely will be fixed with the day 1 patch, there is stuff to explore ,and the humor is ok and most important not to much forced
combat 6/10   the idea of the combat system is good just it isnt as good as it wants to be especialy when it comes to the dodge and parry system the dodges r a bit to shortranged in my eyes and the timing of parries is lets say hard since its confuses the player with colors and timings (u r not supposed to parry when the color shows up u shall follow the enemy movement but honestly its a gaming reflex to parry if a enemy suddenly glows thats how all other games work) 

In the end it still needs a few patches to be what it wants to be especialy when it comes to the fighting system but overall i like it.I´d recommend for all which r not sure to buy it to wait a bit till the first patches r out and give it a try then.

5405,137021327.0,2320910,"I've been hyped for the game for a long time but after playing, it does have a few issues. 

The performance is unexpectedly poor despite the retro graphics, the 5 seconds here and there where it's smooth is lovely. Another issue is with Quest2 on PC there's a few inches of offset between the in-game hands and the controllers irl. There really should be a HIDE WRISTS setting since they don't follow the irl wrists at all, it breaks the immersion every time I point a weapon. A gr8 example of VR wrists is RE4VR, it has wrists that bent similar to how they bend irl.

The Axe throw mechanic feels like it needs work. It'll function for maybe 10 seconds until an enemy is onscreen, then the axe just drops like a weight. The axe dropping issue also applies to whatever weapon I switch to so the sword, staff, etc. feels unfinished. The axe could also benefit from having a bit of weight added like many other vr games with weighty weapons like Walking Dead S&S etc. and perhaps a collision sound and particle effect when thumping a wall with it. Besides that it does feel good to chop foes but again the axe spinning special attack feels so wrong when pointing it forward due to the ugly wrist pointing up to the sky.

If there's an update fixing the performance and axe throw mechanic I'll switch my review to positive cuz I still really love Amid Evil. I'll probably fight through the weirdness for another couple levels still, it's so close to excellent! Still hyped for it",0.0

5429,137024294.0,1457080,"At 30 bucks this game does not deliver. Not to undermine the hard work from the developers because I can tell there's care behind some of the aspects of this game. But if this wasn't attached to League's IP this game would be generic and boring.

I'm not being entirely objective and I won't pretend so either. I'm a fan of the genre, but not a hardcore one. I find the art-style to be blander than I expected. At the beginning I was stunned but quickly that faded and I was a bit underwhelmed. Some of the areas like the hub look very nice and the animations are definitely great to look at. But some of the other areas and backgrounds left me a little disappointed. Sometimes the perspective can be a little confusing too and I feel like the pixel work could have been better, but maybe it's because I have played other games with an aesthetic that attracted me more. 

Then there's almost no voice lines, and the game loop is repetitive as hell. You're gonna find yourself spamming the same moves and not using the spell mechanic so much expect for some of the big enemies because the mana is very limited. And if you do it's probably because it's your 9th side quest where you gotta beat 12 waves of the same 4 enemies and you just kind of want it to be over with. 

There's some great ideas here that I really appreciate like how you grow stronger with the followers you recruit, it gives the game an appropriate feeling. But then there's other things like the fact that you can waste all your potions while at full health. I found this to be pretty frustrating. The hardest difficulty is, in my opinion, challenging enough without having to worry about spending all of my potions by mistake while I was at full health and throwing away a change at winning.

Which leads me also to the fact that for some reason there's no shortcut to the battles. Yes there's a sort of fast forward that skips dialogue but sometimes there's plenty of animations before a battle starts and you have to sit through them every time...

In my opinion this game would have been fine at 15 bucks, maybe 20. But as it is.. I wouldn't recommend it unless you are crazy for the League universe or the game genre",0.0

I feel like the developers were so impressed with the various mechanics they were able to create that they never considered the feedback loop of the gameplay.  Right now you can only send one mission to any planet, and unless you send multiple scientists there is a high chance that you don't get theories.  Without theories you can't generate patents, which are the only way to boost your monthly income.  Worse patents only last for 12 months once created so you need a continuous supply of theories, which have a definite finite limit.

Worse the AI for the medical room is trash.  Its not just poor, but actively works to hinder the player by not having medics prioritize healing the sick and injured.  Someone who gets hurt is liable to spend months lying in a medical bed because the medic prioritizes training and socializing over healing.

This is an early access game and there is plenty of room for major improvements, but unless I see some I cannot recommend this game.  Right now in the state its in the game has a ""you are losing and it will keep getting worse until you quit"" gameplay loop.  there is rarely a feeling that you are moving forward and most of your play is defensive to try to prevent the inevitable collapse and bankruptcy.

You write patents to make money but they only seem to pay around $10,000 for a limited time. That is enough to pay maybe 2 people. You will need to pay teams of people from scientists, medics, soldiers etc and the money runs out fast.

Also some dialogs have weird religious phrases that feel completely out of place, really don't know what is going on with that.

- Way way to easy to over build at the beginning, should have better into quest series that limits what you can buy/do. 
- RNG especially in your first several missions can end your game. First couple planets should have better/guaranteed drop rate of research items.
- You get a single 10 day warning of invasion, nothing else. It's not enough time to research, build, and recruit the needed defenses. This ended my latest game as I was unable to recover from the attack.
- Very unforgiving play, as in you need to know what is going to happen from previous playthrough to plan your base correctly and know when to do things.
- No feedback on what some icons and status effects mean. Had no idea that there is a mission leader which most all of the RNG is based off of. Can't get gaters to drop things in the base and it permanently locks them out from do anything else. Have to reload to fix.
- Gaters can get stuck inside objects or between objects and walls easily. Have to reload to fix.
- Gaters can also get stuck doing a task, never take care of themselves, and quit. Have to reload to fix.
- Trivially, the mission returned screen pops up and triggers or interrupts what you're doing. Would like it to pop up like the mission progress.

i work as a barista part time and i actually had what i described as my first ""coffee talk"" experience in real life only a couple days ago with this woman that ordered a chai. i like to think that was incredibly divine timing, considering this sequels release.

she asked me something along these lines, ""what do i do when i am vulnerable with someone and they mistreat me for being emotional?"" of course i was taken back by this question as i have never been asked such an introspective and openly vulnerable question by a customer before. we have a beautiful conversation, and for a couple hours i am stuck in my head wondering how i may have given off an energy that she could feel that she could confide personal feelings with a barista, a stranger she's never met before.

in the same day, she comes back. she thanks me for listening and giving her advice and explains that there was a situation where she was refused accommodation for an unseen disability she has. 
i tell her that it wasn't her fault and that when someone has the ability to be accommodating & kind and chooses not to be, it isn't a fault or something that she did and this leads into what i want to say about coffee talk. 

coffee talk is just a game really. but its a bit more than that, at least for me personally. you might know a person, you see them all the time walking around, doing typical human person things but there are stories and so many memories attached to each person you see. i don't think i will forget the conversation i had with her, she reminded me that we are complex & to comfortably express being vulnerable, something i need to practice myself sometimes. why not listen to our friends and provide a safe space for them when we can, rather than refusing outright when we have capability to be warm & loving people. we can absolutely practice being more vulnerable & more accommodating to someone being vulnerable. which includes writing this sappy review of one of my favourite games i have ever played. thanks coffee talk for being such a comforting game & that teaching me that humans were made to connect <3",1.0

I can't recommend it enough as a multiplayer experience. Because of how fast and easy it is for things to go horribly wrong, it really helps build clear communication.
It's a stealth-focused rogue-lite platformer with base building and colony sim mechanics. Each of your agents has positive and negative quirks that greatly effect the mission. If you succeed, you gain XP and the agents can level out of those negative perks. If you don't succeed, that agent is gone forever. However, you can kidnap enemy agents on missions and then brainwash them into becoming playable agents. It gets more and more complex from there.

5487,137026866.0,1396190,"I usually want to give a positive review on indie games that are mid, but I don't think I can recommend this one.

The best parts of this game are the environments, voice acting, and cut scene choreography. These components are at a stark mismatch with the lower effort low-poly graphics, but at least they filled the environment out with decent effects and lighting.

I was expecting a puzzle game with some light platforming and exploration. Unfortunately the puzzles are kid-tier and the platforming isn't great. Tedium as a difficulty. 

It seems like a decent portion of the game is stealth sequences with invisible enemies - which is again at a massively stark contrast with the childlike components of the rest of the game. What an unpleasant experience to have to constantly ping the invisible enemies with your flashlight, but don't shine them for more than a millisecond or they will stagger and stop their patrol, making you wait even longer for that opening. Also these enemies are not repelled by the light sources that eradicate the other black slime patches. Not intuitive at all.

The controls are very frustrating. Sometimes you don't clamber on a ledge when you should, and some ledges just can't be clambered, but there is nothing indicating that. You cannot rebind the controls and they set Q to interact instead of the industry standard E. Also set SHIFT to crouch instead of the industry standard C or CRTL. Weird choices that are annoying to get used to - unless this is the only game you've ever played...I guess. 

You can't aim your weapon, only use it in the flat direction your character is facing. You can't aim up or down. So if you want to drop into an area with invisible enemies patrolling, then you can't shine down to see where they are in advance. Just hope for the best. I really don't see a reason for the enemies to be invisible, it doesn't add any extra challenge or fun, just work.

Possible the worst thing about this game, and something that I've never seen done in 30 years of gaming, is extremely poor saving/advancing. You can collect hidden gems, but if you don't complete a puzzle after that, then you'll have to do it again when you play next. Sometimes you will advance to an area and a cutscene will pull you to the next without any confirmation, meaning you can no longer get the hidden gems in that area. And these trigger points are not telegraphed at all. Not like you open a door to advance, you're just walking along and a guy starts talking to you and pulls you to the next area.

This is pretty much a step down in every way except graphically, where it's debatable whether the isometric 3d is an improvement or not. 

Character portraits and some of the art definitely seems worse, or at least inconsistent with the overall design.

The game is surprisingly buggy, considering it's a straight remake. I've had challenge runs (fixed maps, where nothing in random) fail because certain mechanics didn't work correctly.

Despite having the opportunity on remaking the game to tidy up some of the atmosphere and the humor, the only changes seem to have been to pare down on a few features.

-[b]Ruined King: A League of Legends Story:[/b] An immersive dive into the world of Runeterra via its incredible presentation. It's also not bad to play, provided you are into crunchy turn basesd RPGs and can stomach a gromps-worth of mechanical bloat.

I do plan to finish Mageseeker to find where the narrative takes me, but the $30 launch price is a lot to ask for a game that's most engaging when you're not playing it. Consider my alternatives first if you haven't gotten around to them yet. They are slightly more expensive at full price but are considerably more rewarding.

a) There are bugs that prevent you from fighting battles with reinforcements, which is a serious issue.

b) The UI of the game is exceptionally bad, and half the time the tooltips don't work or display incorrect text.

c) The game has this weird micro-transaction thing going on in it. You can purchase gold with real world money, and you apparently need to unlock the nations within the game with it or something? I'm not entirely sure how it works, but at least for custom battles you have to buy them with in-game gold(that you acquire with real money, or super slowly by playing the game). When I pay a bunch of money for a game, I expect to be able to play all the contents in it without having to pay MORE due to in-game microtransactions. If this was a free-to-play game then perhaps such things(along with the numerous bugs) could be overlooked, but as is, it's a definite no from me.

All in all a huge shame, the game has great promise, and especially the era it's set on is monstrously underexplored in the wargame genre(or any games or fiction for that matter), so it's really disappointing that it ends up being a hastily slapped together cash-grab from the looks of it. Even if that's not the intent, the lack of polish is too much for me to recommend it until all issues are fixed.

There are 4 regular fish, and 1 special one:
1 A fat fish.
2 A long fish.
3 An eel thing.
4 A manta ray.
5 A BIG octopus thing.

1 and 2 share an area, as do 3 and 4.
You have limited inventory, so you'll need to go back to robe-guy occasionally to drop 'em off.
After you've caught four of each, you have to fish up a gamecube floating under a noisy cloud, which lets you talk to the star giant, who summons the special 5th fish for you.
After catching fish 5 and dropping it off, I guess the world is saved?...
[spoiler]Either that, or everyone on the planet dies, and are reborn as space-birds? Who can say?[/spoiler]

It's not a horror game, but it has a great ominous and tense atmosphere, and just looks really cool!

I should also probably mention, that my PC is well-below the recommended specs, but ran the game perfectly.

My only gripes are two slight lacks of clarity:

1 It took a bit to figure out how to actually reel fish in, finding/hooking is easy, but when I hooked 'em I couldn't figure out how to move the white bar, which you have to keep inside the yellow one...after many failed attempts I finally realized you move it by moving the mouse horizontally...I had been mashing/clicking everything, but didn't think to do that...Then again, I don't play a lot of fishing games, so maybe this is normal? It did SHOW an example of catching, but didn't actually say ""move the mouse, dum-dum""

2 I rowed around for quite a bit in Astra looking for fish 5, but didn't think to look straight down under my boat, and when I failed to catch it, I rowed around again for a while without finding it...tho after talking to the giant again, it respawned.

^ Then again, these gripes can also be summarized as ""I may just be an idiot"".

Even with my rough start and long search for fish 5, I still won the game in about an hour, so maybe it can be done in 30-40 min if you know what you're doing?

I played tons of VR mods from Team Beef, Luke Ross, OpenMorrowind ect ect. I tried Serous Sam VR, Fallout 4 VR, Borderlands 2 VR, X Rebirth VR and this has to be one of the best implementation to VR I seen so far natively. I have over 200 VR games and this has to be one of the best performing and fun games on it.

Great music and audio in this game. If you like retro games, you will love this fast paced title. The only thing I would like to see is the option to not hold your hand over your head to trigger the special powers, as I did that by accident a few times when using the staff.

5536,137025096.0,1434540,"Initial impressions are positive. I don't play a ton of roguelites, so figuring out which builds work best involves a lot of trial and error on my part. Learning as I go and all that. The soundtrack is relaxing and well suits the world of the game. I've left Zoeti running in the background while working simply because its music brightens up the day. Love the character designs, and the dialogue makes me smirk more times than I expected (cheeky, cheeky Rabelle).

Some points for improvement: it seems like this game may have been initially designed for tablets/mobile devices based on the controls. I couldn't find options for remapping either, which was a bit disappointing. There also aren't really any tutorials in-game on how to play a move once it's selected, for example; the answer is just swiping them up toward the fight like you would in a mobile game. I tried playing with a controller since that's what I prefer when possible, and no tutorial there either; there is a list off to the side on what each button does... but it's only in Chinese.

Aside from the controls learning curve, nothing negative to say so far. It's an enjoyable time with adorable artwork and lots of options on how to build my deck. Looking forward to unlocking more characters and learning about all the variety in each of their move sets!",1.0
5537,137027238.0,2207490,"I'm a big fan of all of Erik's games, Factory Town include, and playtested this game, so I'm a bit biased, but I think it's something truly interesting!

""Idle"" games have always been a weird concept. From the early days of something like Cookie Clicker, they were made as experimental or joke games originally. Then, mobile games happened... And the design of low-effort, high-feedback ""addictive"" games fit the usual over-abundant genre of games that exist solely to try to suck your wallet through your phone to feed your endless treadmill. There were a few standouts among them that tried to do something extra, things like Realm Grinder or Clicker Heroes, that added a bit more sense of progression, and maybe just a hint of strategy and management.

Which brings up another huge positive. At least at the time of writing this, there is NO way to progress in the game via microtransactions. I actually can't think of another idle game that does this, and the pace of Factory Town is designed around it, instead of playing slow to tempt you into an additional purchase.

All that said, Factory Town Idle is something different, to the point that it is far more ""management"" than ""idle"". Though it follows the same exponential progression of an idle game, it's easy to spend hours staring at production lines, tweaking numbers, unlocking improvements, and constantly growing. You'll soon unlock the ability to make multiple towns (which are basically new game sessions) and trade between them, which means the likelihood of running out of things to do is extremely low. The only thing that's truly ""idle"" about the game is that you can (optionally) continue running things while the game is closed.

This does, however, mean that the game isn't for everyone, and, confusingly, it might not be right for the average idle game player; someone who wants short bursts of a thing they can check on now and then and play casually. It's designed more for number-crunching optimizers, who don't mind clicking through endless (yet entertaining) spreadsheets. It also seems like it could be a bit overwhelming at first for someone not familiar with Factory Town, since it's an abstraction of the same things you would do in that game: use workers to make goods, sell goods to houses, use coins to make upgrades, grow, plan, automate, repeat.

For me, though, this feels like the evolution of a genre, and I'd really like to see more small devs take on ideas like this; taking engaging concepts that have been abused in mobile games and making them back into properly enjoyable, lovingly designed games.

The game has surprisingly good writing. I was honestly surprised when perhaps my all time favorite word (dubious) was used within the first like 5 minutes of the game. In addition to that, the conversations feel like they could actually happen between two people. I'm sure we all know games or anime or whatever that just makes us think ""The writer has never interacted with another human ever"". This game (at least at the point of me writing this review) does not give off this feeling :). It's also very ""meta"" which I wasn't expecting. I was very amused when there was a long conversation about the struggles of developing a video game and how bad it is to pirate them.  

The game isn't porn. I always have this kind of stereotype where anime inspired visual novels are usually just a medium for viewing porn, but this really isn't the case. There is the flashing scene in the first like isk 15-30- minutes, but that is more of the Shakespearean concept of roping in viewers than a glimpse at how the entire game will play out. Over 2 hours in and that's the only (arguably) NSFW moment present. Don't worry horn dogs, there is a DLC ""adult patch"" available, though not on steam.

With all of that aside, there are some problems. The player character is relatively annoying, though not as annoying as I somewhat expected him to be (forced male). There are some particularly good dialogue options sprinkled in, so it's not as bad as it could be.

Another problem that is present is the load times. Between some scenes the game will load for probably like 2-5 seconds. That might not seem like a lot, but it is a little jarring considering just how well everything else in the game runs. It's not something that particularly hurts my experience, but I imagine it is something potential buyers might wonder about.

TL:DR Buy the game, the writing is surprisingly good and it doesn't have a lot of the problems that I assumed would exist in a VN. It's made by an indie group and the director of the group is super active on their discord server in a way that makes me root for their success :)",1.0

5585,137028876.0,2279550,"In this adventure game, you are dropped upon a mysterious island where you must seek for objects, solve riddles, and simply explore.

Because the island is open, you can explore and perform tasks in any order you like. In the event that you select that option before the start of the game, important items will be highlighted once you get near. This makes the game less frustrating because some items can be hidden behind or underneath other items. Additionally, if you change your mind throughout the game, you can turn it off. Just beware that going in blind can make things more difficult for you.

Everything in the game is done using gestures, which makes the game a bit more special. When you use the mouse, you raise a hand that creates a vivid trail. The fact that there is no guesswork involved is a plus. As soon as you move your mouse over a significant item, the gestures appear in the lower right corner.

Puzzles are pretty interesting and don’t force the overused problems such as memorization, color manipulation or block pushing down your throat. There is some classic keycards and codes searching, but there's also stuff you don't see in any similar game.

The diary is the most vital tool you have. It includes notes on each particular task as well as the precise actions that must be completed. Without immediately giving you the answer, it's done really nicely. Additionally, tasks and actions that have been finished are marked off so you can clearly see what has to be done.

The diary contains a lot more information. You can view the map, which highlights significant locations, count the bones that have been found—the game's collectible—read notes and letters that provide details about the underlying plot, and manage your inventory. 

You'll be picking up a lot of seemingly pointless or worthless stuff because this is an adventure game. You can arrange eight of them in the taskbar, allowing easy selection with keys ranging from 1 to 8. With various orbs that have particular abilities, like turning day into night or guiding you to bones, this is quite helpful.

5604,137029072.0,1918970," it's a stealth game sneak around on a large island, avoiding monsters collect pages and blood (using vials) to summon abominations
there's so much atmosphere in the game but it needs more content but hey its early days and for the price its really good
solo is very good fun you die if your not sneaky and the enemy are smart at times
exploiting the map which is so far really cool and spooky and to be honest there's a lot of  things to do quick
and your oil goes FAST and that keeps you safe unless they knock the lamp out of your hands and break it
Im still learning the game and intend to play more asap as the multiplayer is empty for me tonight  sadly
overall give it a go its a good idea for a game and Lovecraftian themed games are always cool

I started playing at first and was disappointed - although the 3D art is interesting, it didn't live up to the old 2D art that I've loved in the previous entries, and the frogs were shockingly easy to find.  I got all the way to the bottom and only had 53 found, though, and that's when I discovered you can also rotate this puzzle.  Suddenly, the 3D made sense, and I actually had to search a little bit.

5608,137027437.0,2254910,"I recently embarked on a delightful adventure with ""100 Hidden Frogs 2,"" and it was an experience that filled my heart with joy and wonder. This captivating puzzle game, which showcases the beauty of nature and the magic of discovery, left me entranced from start to finish.

The game's visual design is nothing short of breathtaking. The lush, vibrant scenes depicting serene ponds, lush forests, and tranquil meadows are a feast for the eyes. The attention to detail is awe-inspiring, with each frog meticulously hidden in plain sight, blending seamlessly into the natural surroundings. As I explored each scene, I found myself marveling at the intricacies of the artwork and the skillful craftsmanship that went into creating such an immersive world.

The gameplay is both challenging and satisfying. Searching for the elusive frogs requires keen observation and sharp problem-solving skills. Each level presents a new set of puzzles and obstacles to overcome, keeping me engaged and motivated to uncover all the hidden treasures. The sense of accomplishment I felt with each discovery was truly rewarding, and it kept me coming back for more.

One of the aspects that touched me the most was the game's sense of connection with nature. ""100 Hidden Frogs 2"" serves as a gentle reminder of the beauty and wonder that surrounds us in the natural world. It encourages players to slow down, observe their surroundings, and appreciate the little miracles that often go unnoticed. It rekindled my love for nature and left me with a renewed appreciation for the simple joys that nature provides.

The game also boasts a soothing, ambient soundtrack that perfectly complements the serene atmosphere of the game. The gentle melodies and nature-inspired soundscape added an extra layer of immersion to my experience, making it all the more captivating and enchanting.

Lastly, I must mention the heartfelt message that resonates throughout the game. ""100 Hidden Frogs 2"" conveys a profound love and respect for nature, reminding us of the importance of preserving our planet's biodiversity and the need to protect our natural habitats. It's a timely and poignant reminder of our responsibility to care for the environment and the precious creatures that call it home.

In conclusion, ""100 Hidden Frogs 2"" is a heartwarming and enchanting puzzle game that touched my soul in ways I didn't expect. Its breathtaking visuals, challenging gameplay, connection with nature, soothing soundtrack, and heartfelt message make it a truly memorable and captivating experience. I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates the wonders of nature and seeks a wholesome and uplifting gaming experience. It's a treasure trove of joy, discovery, and inspiration that will stay with me long after the game is over.",1.0
5609,137029396.0,2118370,"Cannot recommend. Short answer is the developer says you need to build right to not have bosses that are bullet sponges.  But there is no way to make a build since you just open chests and a random thing drops out. Aka extremely bad version of Risk of Rain style buffs.

Longer and more detailed part. They stole stuff from Risk of Rain but even in that game you can choose certain things. Risk of Rain has so many good things and mods helped it be even better since you knew what the items were.  This is a downgrade of that system.

The bosses are 800 Hp and you usually are doing around 1.5 damage per hit.  This means you are having to attack some stupid boss for 500 plus times.  Now you are doing around maybe 2 hits per minute which means that it will take at least 4 minutes to kill him.  Did I mention that your shooting takes stamina?  So you will not be shooting all the time and since not every hit will hit you are around 6 MINUTES for one stupid boss.  This also means you are just watching the same stupid boss go through the same sequence of steps again and again.  Oh and hitboxes are bad since you will take damage from the bosses for no reason. Bosses will do hitscan type attacks offscreen so you will take damage since you could not see their windup.  Bosses can multi-hit you since there seems to be barely any invulnerable frames after taking damage.

Enemies are just simple things and take no thought process to fight.

So how are you supposed to ""Build right"".... There is no way since everything you get up till the first boss is random.  You can pick some stuff after the first boss but again you have at least a 6 minute boring meat shield you have to kill first. That is why this is a failure of the developer not designing the game right since no game should just have stupid bullet sponge bosses.

Again cannot recommend and probably will ask for a refund since this game is not good but will decide in the next week since I still have at least a week before I would be above the thresholds..  The developer needs to ""git gud.""

Actually decided not worth my time since it seems that it maybe has at most 4 hours of gameplay.  For a  roguelite that is extremely low.

Edit Just watched the developer play and within 2 minutes they died to the first boss.  Only getting him to half health.  It was due to one ability that you get only on one broom.  There is a high change you would not even get the ability if you played other brooms.",0.0

Comment
Gameplay ; 

Not fast enough and race track is too wide , basically leaving too wide of a margin before making an error (ez mode)
While it also doesn't go fast enough , stuns from power is simply too long , 1.5 second setback in a racing game is stupid insane if there's almost no mean to get those 1.5 second back.

You will get hit by power too because there's basically no indicator that one is coming

take almost a minute to find a match near rank 20 , and sometime it can't find enough people and cancel the queue.

teleport (from Mike and catchup power (which  you can get in first place)) will no go through jump correctly and will get you head first in a platform instead of getting on it , this will kill you and make you be in last position in any map from Pirates of the caribbean.

Wining in rank usually award you rank , however i've had game where it lost me rank .
Usually you get rank from being in top half.

You will also see that it isn't balance for a second and will put you against people with character 28/30/32 (how the f*** did they get to that , i'm questioning if they did it legit) and good luck fighting against someone double your level because that mean they go faster then you , oh and their power will be more usefull then yours.

Can't recommend this game.

Skill ceiling is stupidly low , you will win by just having good RNG and really can't recommend until they remove their entire ""lv up your car / character / crew"" mechanic.

Also fun fact because it has a battle pass steam won't refund it to you once you bought it , so if you though of trying it out and refunding , don't bother , they won't accept it.

Reason why i would recommend this game

5621,137031396.0,1928870,"[b]To all the negative reviews out there. Minecraft Legends is an RTS. Please set your expectations right.[/b]

An RTS is about commanding; telling your troops/builders what to do. In an RTS, troops do stand still and do nothing because you didn't tell them what to attack next. (Not the AI bugging out)

[hr][/hr]

Okay with that out of the way...

Minecraft Legends simplifies the usual real-time strategy gameplay loop hardcore RTS players might be used to. Say goodbye to your teleporting camera, drag select, and clicks per second, because you're no longer an armchair general. Now you lead your troops into battle and this concept strongly restricts the range of micro-management you have over the battlefield. This restriction actually makes Minecraft Legends a very good entry RTS.

I fully recommend this game for the types of players listed below. Consider buying the game if you fall in any of these categories.
1. new to RTS and interested in trying it out
2. played RTS in the past casually
3. has a group of friends you want to mess around with (in PVP & PVE)

5625,137030219.0,1928870,"From the get go I had in mind that this game is built to be PvP focused. However gameplay is slow, and in a multiplayer match players will be leaving and joining as the 4v4 match takes a very long time to complete. 30 minutes ish if the players know what they're doing or an hour plus if they don't. There is no visible MMR system or ranks, the PvP portion of swinging your swords at each other on your mounts is very wonky. Most of the time it felt like I should have hit my opponent or that I was far enough after disengaging that I shouldn't have been getting hit.

I hope in the future they change PvP for the sake of the game, standardize the map instead of having it randomly generate everytime. I can only see them adopting a sort of League of Legends style arena with piglin bases to the side and resource generators you can upgrade through the prismarine. The PvP aspect needs to be standardized imo for briefer matchs and an MMR system implimented to keep matches balanced. Maybe even a smaller arena until you reach a high enough rank.

As for the PvE portion of the game, for me it was more enjoyable but rather tedious. I find myself either waiting for a building to fall or running around trying not to die from getting spammed by ranged enemies. The piglins have massive bases but you only need to attack a small portion of it to defeat them. I have just started so perhaps I just haven't experienced the entirety it has to offer but I suspect its just more of the same save for tougher ai enemies yet to be encountered, even bigger piglin bases that I only need to attack a small portion of but wait around for 20 minutes to take out defensive towers and piglin spawners that are in my way towards the portal.

All in all its a promising shell of a game that fails to deliver the impressive rts punch. Perhaps I'm just too old (I'm 27) and shouldn't be so worried about a game aimed more towards children.

I was one of many who wait release of that game with a big hopes and great hype. But now it's there and... huh.

First of all, [b]pros:[/b]
[b]+Music[/b] is great and I love it. Most of shooter-rhythm games just stick with rock or metal and hear something like that it's breath of fresh air.
[b]+Movement[/b] is fluid and have momentum. It's fun to move around and play with acceleration.
[b]+Shooting[/b] is not that impactful as it must be but it's not bad.

And, sad to say, [b]cons:[/b]
[b]-Content[/b] for now it's barely have any. It's sure is gonna be not issue later but for now if you buy a game you get almost no content at all.
[b]-Weapon Balance[/b] is debatable thing but Rocket Launcher almost oneshot everything while shotgun require sometimes absurd amount of shots.
[b]-Level Structure Ideology[/b] is bland. Checkpoint system level feels fun enough but there's only one.
Arenas is good addition to game content but for now [u]they are[/u] main content.
There was very little interactables and clever design in those levels, they are mostly empty room with enemies, jumppads and explosives.
There is no clever use of verticality, not enough hazards or in general no interesting places to play around.
It's really sad when the best levels in gameplay design sense is corridor with empty rooms and round arena with abyss around.
[b]-Game Structure[/b] there is no progression at all. You can choose whatever song you want, any level you want but can't choose character on it, there is no track of your runs, there is no unlocks (if theres any, all my win runs unlock nothing).
You feel like you just aimlessly play the songs and don't have even reward of what grade you get from complete it outside your final screen on current run.
[b]-Enemy Attacks Variety[/b] is lacking. There was only projectiles or contact damage. It's hard task to balance a bunch of variety in games like that, but it need more of it.
Some enemies have shields and that's already good path to spice things up but it need more.
[b]-Custom Songs Rhythm[/b] ... it's works in 5-10% of songs. Auto-BPM also can't properly detect bpm if song is not super flat.
[b]-Original Songs Rhythm[/b] in general it's fine but it really hit or miss sometimes.
[b]-Weapon Auto-Fire[/b] is weird. You can just hold button and auto-shoot. I don't even notice if that impact score at all but it must be toggleable feature. It kill all purpose of having rhythm.

[hr][/hr]

I wish later I can return and change that review, but for now the game is a mess. It's not horrible in any case it's just a really weak game with no hooks or depth.

So if you wanna buy it now, go on, why not, but don't expect a good experience. It's really mid and weak.

[h1] That section is for Devs (If they bother to get feedback) [/h1]

I'm just a lil guy who don't even publish my games and don't even finish them most of the time, so my words is can be irrelevant, but I really hope this game is get changes and I only wish best for devs.
So let me say my suggestions:

[b]Progression:[/b] that game need one. Even if it's simple like unlock levels not from start or some songs. Just show closed levels/songs to player and way to unlock it even if it's simple like finish one or couple another songs. No need to lock everything but for now it's feels totally aimless.
[b]Progression Tracking:[/b] the menu currently is full sandbox. It's okay if you aim on that but hope you consider to add grades and run statistics. Even simplified one. The levels or songs don't even shown any completion on them and you don't feel engaged to beat it on high score because of that.
[b]Progression/Freeplay:[/b] if you gonna consider adding any progression but aim mostly on free player experience, the good way to do it, simply separate current game selection mechanics into 'Freeplay' mode.
[b]Character Selection:[/b] weird to feel when characters is mostly generate difficulty but they attached to levels. If you want so much allow player choose whatever they want, allow them to choose characters also. Cause thet's a good wat to squeze more from few selection of levels.

[b]Level Design:[/b] if your main aim is arena style gameplay I can't complain but I was sure most of players get hyped because linear style of levels. If you already work on some, then it's great but I hope arenas gonna be additional type of levels, instead of main one.
[b]Score System:[/b] games like this is score oreintated and curently game feed is lacking. There was no clear indecation of why and how to get better scor except obvious ways. There was no wat to compete agains another player or the game currently. If there was changes to give moore feedback to players and have any leaderboard on at least main songs of the game it's can be way more engaging to replay songs better and better.
[b]Level Interactions:[/b] jump pads, abyss, explosives it's a good starting point, but there was a very little way's to expirement with that. There was almost no elevation in linear levels also. It's all make the level design bland and most of the time not engaging to play levels in different ways.
[b]Enemy Projectiles:[/b] Theres very few of them. Almost all attack is - 'contact damage, contact damage from charging at you, direct bullet projectile, homing bullet projectile, prediction bullet projectile and ground zone bullet projectile.'
It's good start but bad variety in long terms. There is many games what already show how do more from little. If you consider adding more 'wave', 'direct lasor'  or 'AOE' projectiles with good indication of them coming it can spice up gameplay a lot.
[b]Characters and their Difficulty:[/b] the only difference now as I notice it's amount of health and 'ability'. That means if you already use ability the difference for current gameplay between characters is simply none. That's not a good way to build character based gameplay.
If they have different speed, amount of jumps, some other ways to change their movements, that's already a great way to differentiate them from each other.
In perfect world the differenct sets of weapons is way to go, but that's a too much work.
[b]Weapon Difference and Balance:[/b] As I said before, Rocket Launcher way to powerful while using shotgun to blast some big enemies is invalid especially while there is a bunch of projectiles around.
But thing is, idea around you have different range wepon is clash hard with unability to select weapons manually. If you stick with idea of weapon scrolling that way maybe that's a good idea to give them alternative fire? Like more aoe attack for rifle weapon or more distant attack for shotgun.
I get the idea of timing your movement to upcoming weapon for change distance between you and enemy but in practice most valid strategy is maintain same distance and wait for better weapon, cause the speed of weapon appearance is way fast than your ability to plan and execute that.
[b]Run Modifiers:[/b] another way to make more from few selection of levels is while having a good track of your score in menu have modifiers for current run. You get the idea. Also Auto-shoot can be one of them, instead being constant cheeze-card.

[b]Custom Songs and their Mapper:[/b] first of all it barely works. It's automaticly give 400 bpm to Elden Ring ost (I test a lot of weird songs to watch if mapper can handle anything) and that's the most fun expirience.
sadly, out of beat stuff it's not that fun expiriense at all.
Two things must be done or that feature is gonna be as useles as most of automappers in other rhythm games:
[b]Custom Songs Mapper Editor:[/b] instead of automate process allow players to put map handly and shift bpm on the fly. It's gonna lead to really good maps as well as funny shenanigans especially when players can set manually what weapon used in what part of the song. Honestly, any editor (like a FNF for example) can be a real game changer for stuff like that.",0.0

P.S. People comparing this to Project Zomboid are missing the point the only thing Dead Unending really has in common with PZ is the isometric viewpoint.

5643,137031672.0,1608640,"It has some good aspects. Killing enemies and creating combos feels great. But the game has some mechanics that really work against itself. The focus slows things down when I'm trying to enjoy the past pace of the game so I end up rarely using it. 
Enemy bullets are so fast its impossible to try and dodge them unless you happen to perfectly use your focus. But enemies also have no signalling as to when they will shoot so its hard to tell when a good time to even use focus is.

Then there is the readability. Everything kinda blends together with the black and white. Its hard to tell when something is an obstacles like a table or a wall. So I ended up getting stuck behind obstacles rather often trying to dodge enemy fire. 
The game also doesnt give a lot of feedback to the player when it comes to getting hit. So its hard to learn from your own mistakes.

Lastly is the roguelike aspect. You can unlock new power ups by spending in-run currency. Not something I would recommend for any game. Choosing between trying to maximize a runs potential or unlock new stuff for other runs is never a fun decision and dying with a lot of cash on hand feels extra agonazing because of this.

When only a few enemies remain, they are highlighted in the room to make finding the last stragglers far easier, making the search for those few guys you missed a lot less painful. 

All of the guns (I've seen so far) can be reloaded, allowing you to hold on to a favorite gun a bit longer at the cost of slowing your momentum by having to wait for the reload animation.

The dodge roll can be used to traverse small pieces of furniture, making awkward room structure less of a hassle to traverse while allowing you to still avoid damage.

You have a health bar, but the game feels like it's balanced around it accordingly. Enemies are more alert and can also take more than one shot before dying.

-weapons are a little miss-allied with quest 2

-I feel like swapping hands needs to be done with the weapon wheel, feels really annoying to pretty much have to hold my off hand with 3 fingures or i accidently switch hands. though i do really appreciate the option to do it mid game!
-platforming feels off, it feels like my jumps are just slightly too weak and my players hitbox for standing near ledges feels just a little small. They definitely cut sections of the forge level for this reason, my favorite part of it too. shame.

If you've played Amid Evil you'll feel right at home here - it's not an FPS awkwardly ported into VR. Each weapon has its own level of interactivity and immersion and no cuts were made to the level design in the transition. Every secret and room is presented in full. That being said, this is quite literally just Amid Evil, but in VR. There's no new levels or doohickeys exclusive to this version, which you can take either positively or negatively.

My only nitpick with the game right now is there is not an option to disable the underwater filter that overlays the screen. I'm not super prone to VR sickness, however I found myself wanting to stay out of the water as long as possible because it was pretty nauseating for me.

Overall though I'm super satisfied with this version of Amid Evil so far; congrats to Dave and Indefatigable on the successful launch!

5667,137033262.0,1537830,"I do worry about the potential for monetization, as others have said, but I want to focus this review on the other aspects of the game for those who want to know about the gameplay itself.

I'm not the biggest racing or cart racer fan, but I've played a good amount of Mario Kart in my time, as well as some Kart Rider Drift and others. And, all of that in mind, I genuinely think Disney Speedstorm might actually be my favorite of them (monetization not withstanding.) 

The tracks are all beautiful and detailed, taking you through a number of worlds and scenes from various Disney movies and parks, all with plenty of shortcut, alternate routes, mirror courses, alternate starts, and more - plenty to keep it fresh and develop your own way through a course, plan tactically, and speed past opponents.

The characters are tons of fun, at least if you're a Disney fan. Many of them use classic lines from their respective movies, but but with a racing twist. And there's Figment representation! Disney parks fans rejoice.

The best part of all, so far, is the music. Each course has a number of different remixed tunes to go along with it - Make a Man Out Of You for the Mulan one, some of the Muses' gospel-sounding tracks for Hercules, etc. And these go harder than they have any right to. Absolute jams that will tickle your nostalgia while also putting you in the racing mood.

There's a couple different online race modes, as well as a ton of ""story quests"" that take the form of various challenge races - standard races, time trials, elimination modes, ones where you need to play as a certain character, ones with missions to perform x amount of stuns or use a number of items, etc. There's a lot of variety, and they seem like a great way to learn the mechanics, as well as start unlocking some characters and leveling them up!

All of the above makes this, for me, probably the best cart racer on PC, and a definite favorite overall personally.

Going into some of the progression mechanics - I'm 50/50 on them. First, there's the issue of monetization. Everything here is setup to support battlepasses for years to come which, on its own, isn't the worst thing... But there's also loot boxes (currently only purchasable with battle pass and other in-game currencies) and gacha shards to collect. For that reason, I am worried as others are.

That being said, if there wasn't monetizaiton to all of this (or if the monetization could stay purely cosmetic) I personally find the progression and gameplay loop appealing. I'm goal oriented, I like seeing numbers go up, so acquiring unlocks and things to fine tune stats and unlock new skills would be a nice mechanic if it wasn't a red flag here. At the same time, I can see why this might be a turn off for some folks who just want a ""pure"" cart racing experience, but there's plenty of room for private lobbies and alternate game modes (the former seems to already exist) that I hope the devs can consider in the future!

The one saving grace for now is that there doesn't appear to be any option to spend money beyond buying the game itself (or a Founder's Pack,) or a battle pass, meaning the only P2W present is a few exclusive skins for the early access packs and a bit of quicker progression for those with the premium battlepass unlocked. On top of that, in addition to your standard daily and weekly rotation of battle pass challenges to complete for progress, there seems to be a system in place for a seasonal story mode with challenges similar to the base game's story quest with tons and tons of time trials and objectives to complete to earn experience on the pass even as a solo player, or someone still learning and gearing up. 

Overall, I definitely do recommend the game. It's great fun, and the core game is clearly made with passion for the movies and characters with many levels of detail and effort put in that it doesn't feel like *just* a cash grab. I just hope that the monetization stays tame enough to keep people engaged and not scared away by credit card swipers.",1.0

I can see this game having potential of being one of the best kart racers on steam, as far free to play games on steam go anyways. 
My main complains are , sometimes the game disconnects from the gameloft's servers and it's annoying because that disconnects you from the game itself even when you're doing singleplayer stuff 
The drift feels a bit awkward to pull off, like does not feel consistent if that makes any sense regardless of what character class you choose it feels inconsistent to string drifts sometimes its a faster windup, sometimes it's delayed for a 2 seconds more, it feels weird not sure if it's just me or if it's an actual thing that needs fix. 
Some story chapters require you to play with a specific character and said you might not have that character to progress, how you obtain that character ? you do challenges and hope RNG supplies you with said shards to unlock character or waste money on drops.

5676,137031889.0,1976950,"The original Desktop Dungeons was one of my all time favorite quasi-roguelikes. The art, the humor, the surprising amount of depth really made it my go-to solution for coffee break games for a long time. DD had a slight problem, though, one that I think long time players were not impacted greatly by but was certainly preventing the game from drawing in new players or offering the devs much breathing room for future work on a wonderful game: the UI, as gorgeous as it was, was pretty limiting and showing its age pretty severely. 

Rewind at first seems like all it does is bring the original DD forward in terms of presentation -- a fresh new visual look with art just as charming as the original, maps that actually fit most monitors these days, new writing, and an admittedly (currently, as of the week of its release) somewhat divisive new UI that ultimately allows for more flexibility in builds and I imagine future development -- but look a little deeper and you'll find that they've also made some changes to some classes and kin to help bring less-used combinations into the spotlight as well as the new Rewind mechanic allowing you a chance to save an otherwise botched run with ~neat time travel animations~ 

It really feels like more than a fresh coat of paint, it feels like DD for the modern era and I hope it draws in new people and leads to even more stuff for a game I honestly never imagined would be given this kind of chance. 

If you've never played DD before, absolutely give it a chance, you'll love it. It's a bit like a roguelike and it's a bit like a puzzle game. It's got permadeath, but it's really quick and death isn't very painful. There are permanent upgrades to your kingdom in between runs which include things like new kin and classes to play as as well as new items and other goodies to bring into runs with you. Individual runs all take place on a single dungeon level of your choosing prior to departure where you'll start at level 1 and climb as high as level 10 or so by strategically taking down enemies and being clever. Enemies, in contrast with most other roguelikes or roguelites, do not move around or follow you. They exist only on the tile you discover them on, so you get FULL control over how you interact with them but that means you have to really think about how you go about fighting them so that you can best leverage your abilities to gain the most experience and waste the fewest amount of resources to eventually take on the level boss. 

In addition to a whole bunch of kin and classes to choose from, there are a ton of items you'll progressively unlock and see showing up in your dungeons as well as a pantheon of gods a la Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup who really make runs go in wild directions sometimes.

5677,137033883.0,1457080,"To 100% the game requires roughly 15 hours, which is far less than I expected for a 40$ game. HOWEVER, I am a sucker for lore and they did deliver on that front, reaching a (personally speaking) satisfying conclusion/milestone for the Demacian civil war. Numerous texts in the game reference other entities in the league of legends universe such as evelynn and fiddlesticks. I thoroughly enjoyed it despite the ending requiring some imagination to tie it into the other Universe stories.

The combat is somewhat clunky save for a few specific movesets which can be animation-cancelled, resulting in me defaulting to only two combos outside of spell usage. The Kingslayer difficulty is designed so that you will be punished heavily if you attack recklessly. As a result, mana generation from basic attacks is low and this, in combination with low max mana capacity, discourages usage of non-copied spell except the two which provide shielding and healing. Most of your variety in spell usage will come from stealing enemy spells. Certain side quests introduce rogue-like elements that are not carried over to other missions. This gameplay system was fun but also felt bad afterwards as there is a significant difference in power between main quest Sylas and side quest Sylas. I wish the game fully embraced the rogue-like system for every single mission (with respective balancing of course as there are some perks that are absurdly broken resulting in you one or two-shotting regular mobs.)

I encountered roughly 6 bugs throughout the entire games, most of which are minor, one of which bugged a boss fight for me, forcing me to restart the fight.

5696,137033595.0,2189860,"Fun game so far. Plays kind of like a Vampire Survivor style of game where it auto attacks but in this you can manually aim attacks as well. The title is more on the arcade style of gameplay. Has a few different scenarios you can play through and several selectable characters with different starting weapons and special attacks.

Pros:
- Has 20 minute gameplay loops so can play in small burst
- Stages have missions/quests you can take on which sometimes add to the lore of the scenario or have some funny or weird things that happen. Fun way to break up the gameplay.
- All characters seem to have different specials I am still experimenting with.
- The art style is neat and every scenario feels like a call back to some 70/80’s horror movie.
- Co-op is rad.

Cons:
- Found some parts of the game confusing or not explained too well.
  - Didn’t realize for a couple of playthroughs that the hand looking icons on the upgrades are tied to how many things you 
    can hold. You can only hold up to 8 arm logos things and some items take one arm while others take 2
  - The coins you collect while playing are for an upgrade shop on the main menu
- The boundary of the stages is represented by mist but the player can take damage if they get to a certain point near the colored barrier and not in it. This was confusing the first couple of times I died near the edge of a map but didn’t touch the colored area.
- Explosions pulse the screen with a red effect that looks like you got hurt even if you haven’t got hurt.

- Would be cool to have a mode that chains the scenarios together since they seem like they may be linked to each other story wise.
- Might be a bug but doesn’t seem to save options settings. I personally like turning off the CRT filter, in my opinion makes the game look much better.
- Seems odd these days to not have Steam cards or Achievements. Not a deal breaker for me but I feel like others would want this. 


Will try to update as I play more and see more of the game.

5697,137032960.0,2020710,"I love this game! I had no idea that I'd be playing the full version for 10 hours as soon as I installed it. I bought Raft a few months ago, wanting it to be more like this without even knowing about Havendock at the time. No zombies, battles, military shooting, child wizards, or aliens. So rare, yet so awesome when found.
The ways I can customize the game to my liking are awesome. I like to focus on the mechanics of a new game with as little distractions as possible, so being able to turn off things like weather, death, and disasters was a very welcome feature. I'm able to progress through the game at my own pace and focusing on different parts of the game in the order I choose. 
Judging from the research tree and workshop items not yet built, I could have everything unlocked (researched) and built in another 3/4 hours if not rushing.

Another great addition was the three ""fetch quests"", where you first locate one NPC, and then find ten of the object they show you. Getting all ten and returning to the NPC gives you a key that you can use to open one of three chests, each with a frog inside.

My only critique is that the game is very poorly optimized, so if you've got a lower end system, it's gonna get laggy! My computer can run stuff like the Resident Evil 2 remake without any trouble, but not this. I really hope the developer fixes this in a future update, as I do imagine a lot of people playing these types of games probably aren't running on high end gaming computers.

Much like all the others of this series, there is no real UI beyond 'number of [noun] left' and a Start/Exit menu. There is also a considerable performance issue as it is incredibly slow and a bit choppy, and when I get the the lowest area, the game told me my video memory was exhausted, and to expect poor performance, which it did indeed get worse.

5716,137036198.0,2321210,"Leaving this here for now as a like, but want potential buyers to know a couple of the drawbacks as of EA.

There is no controller support (I'm not sure why it says partial in the description, but KB+M is the only option in game). This game will be MUCH better with controller support, playing it KBM with WASD and I,H,J,K,L feels very unnatural and I do not like it.

1440p is currently the maximum resolution. As someone who exclusively plays on a 4K OLED, I do not like looking at the lower resolution.

The English VA is obviously done by Chinese VA speaking English, and the translations are pretty poor for the time being. I'd gladly volunteer myself for some male VA as I feel I could do a better job (not trying to be rude). 

All that being said, this game is very fun and has a unique aesthetic and some new ideas in the roguelite genre. I think it has a lot of potential, but I'm hesitant with a small Chinese developer in terms of how long it will take to get much needed QOL from what I have mentioned above, and what responses will be like.",1.0
5717,137035395.0,2321210,"Never have I bought a game not even 10 minutes after it was up available for purchase. This game is just aesthetically pleasing in so many ways. The characters. Illustrations. Menu. Upgrades. Skills. Loading screen. Everything. One thing off is that Lilya has two different colored eyes but her model are both one color so that could use a fix.

Lets talk about the game.
It is fully voiced though I'm sure they are just chinese native speakers that know English so it can be a little broken or certain words are pronounce how you look at them such as Mecha being pronounced as Meh cha instead of Meh ka. Some subtitles don't match what they say but it still means the same just used a synonym. During story character models actually move and make face expressions though they're chibi models but cute.
Combat goes from Basic attack combos that can be aimed up but dont change too much. You can down smash. Use skill but there are 4 visible beats and if you do it on the 4th beat the skill will be a much powerful one compared to beat 1, 2 and 3. You can perfect dodge turning it to an attack that telegraphs you right towards the enemy. Another skill lets you attack as you dodge until the meter empties out. Then you have an Ult that has multiple button pressing sequences.
Upgrades. Every now and then you'll get an upgrade. Like hades style. Basic attack will be Lightning, Fire poison etc. Or skills. Whatever you choose BUT if you get two different upgrades on the same attack for instance. Fire/poison on down smash you get BOTH so down smashes will do poison AND fire as long as you picked it both up. I haven't tried more since I haven't played enough. There's more different ways to upgrade yourself which I won't go too much detail into since I haven't gotten a grasp of it yet in memory.
Upon completion of rooms and runs you'll get a type of currency or item that lets you unlock outfits or recolors of your characters that you choose as long as you have the respective amount which I really like and hoping for actual different outfits instead of just different colors. There isn't really any interactions with the environment just killing mobs for now completing rooms and picking rooms. Healing isn't too rare to get so that's good and it isn't too tough only when you get greedy is when you find yourself getting hit a lot. Beautiful game. Love the music and the characters.

5722,137035852.0,1537830,"So far this game has been fun. Like any Early Access plenty of more content is to come. It had a messy launch due to how steam operates but I received everything in my founders pack right away and haven’t had issues! 

This isn’t Disney Mario Kart! It’s a simple Disneyfied racer with some strategy elements! It’s cute and fun but no Forza!  If this might be up your alley read my review further… 

Regarding the negative reviewers who are rating down because of the F2P model. It was always going to be Free to play after paid Early Access. We are paying to help shape the game from this point. If you wanna help offer feedback and offer suggestions to make this game better in quality and content, then jump on board during Early Access. 

Eventually this will have a monetization aspect with micro transactions. That’s what free to play is. If you don’t agree with that business, games as a service model then I recommend you pass on this. 

Anyways; 

Pros; 
Beautiful  visuals, booming tracks, loving the starting character roster! Loving the variety of modes. Game runs great on Steam deck. I have it running at 60 FPS during races. It drops to about 15-30 during loading and sits at 25-40 idling in menus. 

Battery goes from 100% to 75% in one hour on steam deck with 85% volume and max brightness. Then drops to 50% an hour and a half in. 

Modes right now I’ve tried; 
Ranked Multiplayer, Regulated Multiplayer, Season Challenges with a theme, single player mode with challenges, weekly and daily challenges, offline local player mode I have played with the hubby. 

This game wasn’t hard to learn or grasp. Lots of modes that offer challenge but not aggravating. I’m sure multiplayer will get super competitive as time goes on. 

Cons; 
AI bots during multiplayer modes are a lot! I’m sure this will change once more people join the game. I was disappointed my first ranked race was mostly bots and I thought I won based on skill not luck lol! I was also playing late at night so i’m sure during peak hours it’s easier to find other players. 

Recommendations;
Either explain your currencies better or consolidate them. I couldn’t click icons to see what they were or where to get them. I had to google that. There are also so many to keep track of lol! 

Jukebox mode! I wanna listen to those beautiful tracks separate from racing.

5723,137035654.0,1537830,"[h1] Decent and enjoyable Disney themed kart racing game. [/h1]

Disney Speedstorm is a decent kart racing arcade genre that seems to have taken some ideas involving Mario Kart and turning it into its own theme. I was looking forward to the early access release when it was first announced a few months ago. The characters and the animations for each are well-done and each seem to have their own distinct personality while your racing or selecting them in the main menu. I especially love and adore Donald Duck. 

Unlocking parts and suits and paint jobs and customizing your kart is not that difficult but everything I feel is limited and bare in this area right now. The tracks are also wonderfully done and each has its own theme song from the various Disney films that I and most people probably know and used to watch. However, while there are only 8 tracks so far and its limited here as well, more and more additions and features I’m sure will be coming. The chapters/stories are good as well, there’s just some levels like the elimination races that are quite challenging. The AI/computer racers are programmed well to be challenging enough even on medium settings where I have it at.

As far as pay-to-play is concerned like some reviews mentioned, I really have not had that much of an issue with that. It is a bit annoying though how the game tries to force you to do this and that in order to move on, but in my perspective it’s not all that bad. Cross-platform is also a nice feature as well so if I play this on another platform it will smoothly sync between both platforms. I have tested this already and it works well. Overall, if you enjoy Disney films and the iconic characters or like and want something a bit different than Mario Kart, I recommend giving it a chance and picking this up. I do really enjoy it thus far.",1.0

You can view my initial impressions review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/zHhWTHce44w

I do recommend this game. It's pretty much a 1:1 translation of the original non-VR version. What's new is obviously they added 3D visuals to go along with motion controller support. Everything you would pretty much expect is here. Caution however: I did come across a bug where my weapon didn't show up or I could no longer select a weapon. However, the bug was only for a few seconds and did not otherwise effect gameplay.

As far as the visuals, I think they look cool in VR, but I'm not sure this type of art-style really pops in VR. Also, because you're using motion controllers for aiming, the aiming is much easier than the pancake version where you're using KBM. Therefore, I do think the VR version is easier than the non-VR version. However, the good news is that the game has not been nerfed at all for the VR experience. It is all here just like pancake, although some of the levels will come later.

Game is running on the Unreal Engine. On my RTX 3080, on mostly high graphical settings, I was getting mostly 90 fps, with some frame rate drops here and there, usually at the start of levels. You do have full locomotion available, along with smooth or snap turning. You have button crouch or button jump as well. You can play comfortably seated.

Because I already owned Amid Evil, I got a very generous loyalty discount. Thank you devs for that! Make this game quite a deal. I hope more boomer shooters come to VR, especially Dusk!

The menu's could load faster / be a little bit let confusing but once you understand the different modes, its pretty easy. There is a LOT of different modes.

A lot of complaints about ""pay to win"", these just are not true, you cant even buy the premium currency right now and if you could at best you get cosmetics.

The game has a ton of content grind to unlock and upgrade all characters. I am sure they will make it pay to accelerate but you can unlock all content and compete it just might take you a little longer to grind some of the content. They throw free stuff at you constantly just for playing the game.

You can even set level scaling in private multiplayer so you can have even races between friends.

5770,137036211.0,1457080,"9/10, great Game.

Pros:
+Really Really Good story based on Oppression and Revolution.
+Fantastic Gameplay, the Spell thief aspect is wonderfully executed and crafted
+Wonderful Pixel Art, most likely one of the best currently on the Market. 
+Very Interesting Setting, Same with their Previous Game(Riot Forge) named Ruined King, the World of Runeterra really intrigues.
+Gorgeous Animations
+Great Soundtrack

Cons:
-Day 1 DLC, Really shouldn't be here, it really feels like what was put in the DLC and Pre-Order Bonus should just be in the base Game.
-Short. The game takes around 15-20 Hours to beat with Side Content. If this is short for you for the 30 Buck Price Point, then I would wait until it gets on Sale.
-Slow Beginning, It takes around an Hour of Game Progression for the Game to open up to a level that feels like you are not still in the Tutorial.
-Minor Bugs. Should be patched out soon, and they are thankfully not gamebreaking

Overall, I loved the game, if you are interested in the Lore of League of Legends/Arcane/Runeterra. Then this is def a must, otherwise, if you just want a good action game with a good story attached, this will also fulfill that itch.",1.0

5772,137037029.0,1928870,"Minecraft Legends isn't the best game in existence, but despite the current reviews I would never consider it bad by any means as many people want you to believe. It certainly is a bit janky at times, feels ever-so-slightly underpolished, and will definitely kick you to the curb and spit in your face a few times, but there is an incredible amount of quality put into this game. The dynamic between slapping down structures on the fly as you breach into an enemy fortress, collecting resources and special units to temporarily aid you in battles, and summoning infinite amounts of general units to feed the engine of war as you try to order the clusterfuck of different units in the right direction is incredibly fun. 

Each unit has a clear cut purpose for destroying structures, dealing damage from afar or up close, stunning enemies, and healing allies. Different structures have to be used very accordingly to hold the line against the opposition and continue pushing through their defenses. There was clearly lots of thought put into this game, and if it truly were badly designed the reviews would be alot more negative. Its a delicate balance the developers have sewn together. Confusing and janky as it may be, it is a very interesting and fun game that I'd definitely recommend [i]...maybe not at the current price though,[/i] it doesn't have THAT much going for it to justify a $40 price tag. Wait for a sale.

Also I'd like to add that typically I'll play a game to general completion or when I've seen most of the game before reviewing it, but the amount of people reviewing this game that have brains that classify as cantaloupes rather than organs is insane. I cannot comprehend how idiotic someone has to be to think [b]THE FIRST TWO HOURS OF THE GAME THAT TEACH YOU THE BASICS AND ONLY BARELY INTRODUCE NEW UNITS IS THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN.[/b] God, this platform is just pathetic sometimes.

There is not much interaction besides serving coffee, and im fine with that. I do really feel I run a midnight coffee shop off the edge of a road somewhere in Seattle.

5791,137037975.0,1214670,"A cute little roguelite platformer about a quest to recover a lost hat. You build up a base to do things like heal your crew and convert captures to your crew, with a pretty standard roguelite like research system to start accruing those permanent upgrades. A nice assortment of hats and weapons, all with various effects to discover and collect multiple copies of that you'll need for research. Some of the traits a person can get can be frustrating especially when stacked together and leveling up only has a chance to remove a bad trait (though maybe research can help with this regard). Had a few times where I've died and wasn't really sure why, and weapons have very low durability, so if you have someone who can't snap necks or knock people out by landing on them and burn very fast through the durability/ammo you bring with you, it can be quite difficult to go forward.

Biggest Take Away/Final Thoughts:

At first I thought this game was going to be one of those games that I would deem ""The Jump-scare Simulator"" examples: Emily Wants to Play, FNAF, Hello Neighbor,etc... I totally think there is a place for these type of games. But After fully completing the game I walked away with an experience akin to The Evil Within, Resident Evil, Silent Hill etc... Not saying that the quality is the same, but devs made a solid attempt at building this world where it's only a PC and floppy disc away. I say ""attempt"", but honestly I really liked the world creating I thought it was creepy, interesting, fun and most important surprising. Surprising in the sense that this game kinda subverts you into thinking you are going to get one experience, but instead getting in my opinion a more well rounded experience that was a joy to explore, to get the collectibles and hear the experiences of the ones that came before.",1.0
5802,137038493.0,2145190,"The combat is fun but not a fan of the game mode.
What I mean is that we need to find the enenry sources... but the map is quite big.
And the problem with survivor type games is that you are in a race against time to level up faster that enemies can scale, and if we are constantly on the move, that means we are not either not killing enough enemies or not picking up the exp orbs. Either way, it means we are losing on levels while we look for the energy sources.
There are several ways to fix this: 
1. Just give us the exp for killing the enemies without needing to pick them up. We don't have to pick them up, there's no rule saying that ALL VS clone games have to have pick up exp.
2. Show us the map so we can move to the objectives as fast as possible. But even with this method we are still losing out on the level gains, but it makes the problem a bit more tolerable.
3. Slow down the enemy scaling or spawn rate, or both. In that case we have more time to search.

Anyway, if you ONLY care about combat, this game is good. But if you care about beating levels... I personally can't enjoy this.",0.0

If you're into the story for this game it's worth the price, although if you're going to skip past all the cut scenes and are looking purely for game play the game is too short for the current price point in my opinion. It took me only 20 hours to 100% complete the game including all side missions. I highly recommend playing on the highest difficulty gives the game a souls like feel and made boss fights exhilarating. Secondary missions are also not that important, there is a cool story line for one of them where you get to fight a league champion which you would have missed if you only did the main quests. Secondary missions are primarily just for money so you can get upgrades although they are fun, they give a rogue-like feel since during some of the secondary missions you can choose between different spells which give you unique buffs.

5829,137038380.0,1608640,"Getting the comparison out of the way, I've held Hotline Miami (and Wrong Number) as some of my favorite indie games of all time for years. Naturally, with the retro-pixel top view gun-switching ultraviolent fast paced shooter action going here, this game had enormous shoes to fill. So my first few runs made me think ""this is just fresh enough. Some good ideas, nice visuals... Yeah, this is good"".

And then I got into a boss battle with a giant mecha snake with machineguns. In my 4th run. And that was awesome. ""Hotline Miami, this is not"".

So yeah, for anyone like me that might have been worried that this is ""just bringing some decade old game with more modern considerations"", I'm pleased to see that it differentiates itself positively and extremely early. With ""bullet time"" to slow down the massive amount of bullets on the screen, a fresh variety of enemies and bosses early on, and a generous healthbar that will likely deplete after strings of poor decisions and bad planning, each floor has a lot of adrenaline that doesn't reward ""trial and error"", but instead, planning how to approach each room.

Yeah, planning is rewarded... but so is keeping a high combo multiplier to get more money to make your run better. So there's a lot of high-risk high-reward decisions at every moment. Play too safe and you won't be able to afford upgrades, yet play too reckless and you'll end up surrounded with no ""bullet time"" to even the odds.

It's very good action, extremely fast paced, and while it can feel a bit clunky early on due to the unusual controls, waltzing in and painting this black and white mansion red is very gratifying.

So yeah, recommended if you like fast paced action, punishing but fair gameplay, are okay with its violent themes, and if you like roguelikes in general.",1.0

I also made some battle reports and materials about the game in Chinese community.
I started relearning the game about two years ago when I got the beta test for the Flashpoint campaigns Southern Storm. Compared with the previous game, Southern Storm has made many changes in the game mechanism, such as the introduction of standard combat procedures (SOPs), which enriches the details of combat operations and allows players to intervene in combat from more dimensions. In addition, the UI and art of the game has also made great changes, the interface information is detailed and beautiful, and the readability and visibility are very good.
The game supports the PBEM+ system, and players can play against each other. During the test, I also learned a lot about the organization and command of modern warfare from other friends with professional experience, which changed my understanding of modern warfare.

5832,137039801.0,2320910,"Initially, I wrote a very detailed and lengthy review, but then I freaking lost it. So here's the basic gist of it. The game is fun, engaging, and worth whatever you pay. It reminds me of Quake, but despite that, I find the gameplay unique. It's nothing as I've ever played before, and I bet it'll be like that for you too. I haven't played enough of the game's original version to make a direct comparison, but I can talk about the mechanics featured within the VR version. Your non-dominant hand has your health, ammo, and souls featured on it, and your dominant hand holds the weapon of your choice. By clicking the grab button, you can switch out which hand is dominant. You can hold weapons with two hands, but not like you're used to doing in VR. Instead of grabbing the weapon with both hands, you simply move your non-dominant hand to the weapon, and the game grabs it for you. You can throw your weapons by holding the trigger and grab buttons and making a throwing motion, you can do this with every weapon, but the only effective one is the axe. To get your weapon back, you need to click the trigger or grab button, and it teleports to your hand instantly. I like how soul mode is activated in this version, instead of the click of a button. All you have to do is raise your non-dominant hand over your head, which is very easy and quick to do and hard to accidentally do since you don't really need to move your non-dominant hand outside of looking at it to see your health, ammo, and souls. Soul mode gives every weapon an alternate fire which is much more powerful and effective. Even though getting the timing right was initially confusing, you can parry red projectiles with the axe, which hits them back to the enemy and immediately kills them. You could also just cancel out the red projectile with the axe at the cost of ammo and not looking as cool. I've only run into one bug so far, and that was my axe turning invisible and not doing damage which forced me to get killed by an enemy so I could load a save which luckily fixed the issue, and it never showed up again. I beat the first episode, and it was great overall. The pacing is pretty good. Unless I haven't run into any hitscanners yet, you can dodge pretty much everything thrown at you.

Hi fellow gaming Gents,
We have got good promise of a game, I like it, but it is very unbalanced, RNG  based resource income and few bugs makes playthroughs a chore just even to learn mechanics of the game. 

The good:
-atmosphere
-graphics
-very good optimization
-nice game loop
-ok narratives
-ok-ish build options

The bad:
-unforgiving economy-there is not enough resources and money to progress, defend and pay the crew
-terrible combat-basically non-existent (and without sounds) and lackluster in dynamics 
-wonky AI guards leaving posts without any alternative defensive measures
-generally no defensive measures except the guards (though I couldn't go past initial-tutorial campaign due the above reasons, so I might be wrong here)
-no tooltips for many things, trial and error 
-limited building options in some categories

And...after three failed sessions (10 hrs) of the tutorialized missions, the game refuses to start, no error message just black screen, so...well, this EA title needs way more work.

-- some quick notes I wanted to know before buying
Separate text and speech language settings: YES
Separate volume for voices: YES
Controller support: YES (all my playtime is on my standard xbox 360 controller, and I've had zero issues)
Controller button remapping: Mostly (at least one in-combat move seems to be attached to the button you map to interact, and there's no remapping for the menu controls)
English translation: Understandable as far as gameplay but a bit janky.  Some weird language use to get used to, both theme/stylistic and odd word choices.

-- combat
Combat inputs are: jump, dodge, normal attack, special attack (timed cooldown, enhanced on specific music timing), ultimate attack (charged slowly by hits), and trigger temporary power-up mode.  There's also a jump slam attack and teleport-counterattack you get by dodging through an enemy attack (which is pretty strong and generous on timing), and the counterattack and ultimate each trigger a small boost mode which can trigger some special upgrades.  You can duck too, but aside from an upgrade that was triggered by ""squatting"" I'm not sure if it's relevant.  The cooldown on the special feels overly long given the very few actions at your disposal, especially since you'll often need to wait for the beat if you want the better version (I think it does cooldown on the beat, but you have to be ready to hit it exactly off-cooldown or wait a fullbeat cycle).

So far, the rhythm element seems to be limited to activating your special attack on a specific fixed beat every few seconds (instructions say ""on downbeat"", but it's more like every fourth downbeat).  Timing is reasonably generous there.  I'd have liked to see a lot more music linkage.

-- characters
You start with the sword girl and have to unlock the other two through ""story progress"".  I haven't seen the first boss, but I've had several runs and have not unlocked another character yet.

-- upgrades
Uses a Hades-style themed attack upgrade choice (including rarities and bonus rewards for having tried everything in a set, but here you can stack upgrades instead of only having one), select your next stage reward, gifting and keepsakes (seems like keepsakes are empowered by further gifts to that character, not by fighting with them equipped).  Upgrades feel very Hades on a basic level, but there seem to be some nice/cute variations.

There is also a weird run-upgrade grid you slot items into at the shop.  It's 3x3 and random each run.  Slot items come in different shapes to restrict where you can slot them.  Each slot has a bonus (which can easily be useless to you), and each row and column has an additional bonus if you have all three slots filled.

And then you have ""drinks"" which add some varying upgrade effects, and a larger overarching upgrade that can be a game-changer (one notable one I saw reset the special attack's cooldown as long as you hit the on-beat bonus, which was really nice).

In short, there are a lot of avenues to upgrade during a run.  They're all pretty random.

Metaprogression has three fairly shallow trees.  Unlock nodes to see adjacent nodes, each node has levels it can be upgraded.  Early meta-upgrades look fairly normal, but currency costs seem pretty huge.  There are several meta-currencies to gain and spend.  You look to have up to four keepsake slots, but I've no idea how those are unlocked past the first slot, or whether the keepsakes make for interesting upgrades.

-- level generation and enemies
As far as the first boss's zone, each level seems like a fairly fixed simple platformer style series of rooms, without much of any platforming opportunity, and relatively few enemies arranged in simple groups.  Short series of rooms, take level-end reward, choose next level reward, repeat.  Enemies seem to have very few types and they do only one thing each, so pretty low interest/engagement on the enemy side of the game equation.

There are some kind of trap-based levels, but have not seen one yet to compare its design.

This game WILL be ruined by monetization, because you actually get a gameplay benefit from dropping cash on upgrade items and shards. The worst thing is that you can't even finish the Starter Course if you don't buy the more expensive Founder's Pack, because you need the characters that come with those to play those.

The absolute worst thing that's close to ruining the experience for me is the insanely aggressive rubberbanding. It doesn't matter how high your level is, how perfect you race, the AI will catch up until the last few meters of the lap. I've also encountered AI opponents teleporting right next to you before crossing the finish line. I'm not sure if it's relevant, but that only happens to me when I play a race with a racer that has a lower level than the recommended level for that race. It's unfair and needs fixing.

The good: The soundtrack is great, the graphics look quite pleasing, runs fantastic on Deck and, despite the monetization and rubberbanding, it can be fun to play. I'll definitely put some more hours into this, but I sincerely hope they tweak the monetization and rubberbanding before official release.

With that in mind, the graphics in Disney Speedstorm are absolutely stunning, with bright, vivid colors and intricate designs that really bring each track to life. The attention to detail is impressive, with everything from the background scenery to the character animations looking top-notch.

Gameplay-wise, Disney Speedstorm is a blast to play. The racing mechanics are intuitive and easy to pick up, but there's enough depth there to keep players engaged over the long term. Each character has their own unique special abilities that can be used strategically to gain an edge on the competition, and the tracks themselves are filled with all sorts of hazards and obstacles that will keep you on your toes.

One of the things I really appreciate about Disney Speedstorm is how accessible it is. While there's definitely a learning curve to mastering the game's more advanced mechanics, it's easy enough for anyone to pick up and start playing right away. Plus, with a variety of different modes to choose from, including single-player races and multiplayer matches, there's always something new to try.

Rain Games has Released another gem among their catalog of games.

For those of you playing a Rain game for the 1st time, Don't worry about missing out on lore.  
The game does a fantastic job of guiding you thru the lore even if you haven't played Teslagrad or World to The West via collectibles and on scream prompters.

If you'd REALLY like to know the story, I recommend playing Teslagrad 1 and WttW.  Mesmer as well for the additional world building but it's not essential.

BACK TO THE GAME!

Oh boy! You're in for a puzzle Metroidvania Collectible and it's an electrifying time!  This game takes place Alongside Mesmer, RIGHT after World to the West.
You've crash landed from being pursued and must make your way. TO THE TOWER!!!
You'll puzzle solve, use sweet fluid magnetic controls, platform, have boss fights, EPIC BANGER MUSIC SLAYIN IT, and collectibles with lore pieces scattered thru out the world map. The game doesn't hold your hand BUT, it is VERY intuitive. 

The game clocks at about 3-6 hours depending on how skilled you are at platforming metroidvanias. 
It is an absolute spark of a gem and well worth the 20$ dollars + some if you play the original Teslagrad.

The artwork and 3d models is fantastic, the BGMS slay again, and the.... in game nordic language? all bow wrap this present with a resounding boom and thunderous delivery.

The randomization helps keep things fresh and varied, since you can't just optimize your way to your ultimate builds, at least not right away, and the very act of slaying enemies in the core gameplay loop is very fun and fluid.

Where this game REALLY shines, though, is taking the ""multi"" in ""multimedia experience"" VERY seriously.

The art is gorgeous. The electronic music is great. The voice acting, while cringey at times and clearly made by ESL VAs, has heart and the writing is fairly decent if nothing too special.

5937,137048576.0,1663220,"This game is wonderful, just as good as the first one, if not better in terms of writing. Having the foundation of the first game to use as a stepping stone really helped elevate the writing and expansion of returning characters. Here is my review after my first play-through of the game. 

I normally review games looking at both negatives (the bad) and the positives (the goods) and honestly I only have one negative about this game and it has nothing to do with game play. It is the title.

I have seen many wonder if this is a dlc to the first game rather than a stand alone game due to how they titled it. The ""episode 2"" part needs to go. Just Coffee Talk 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly"" would have been better. The episode part just throws people off. 

And on the other end there's really so much positive to say about the game. The writing in this one is outstanding. The artwork, even though in the style of the first, looks just as wonderful if not better too! I love making drinks and guessing the drink combo's that the character orders. Also like the first game you input your name at the start of the game and the characters throughout the game refer to you by your name. A nice little touch to keep you immersed. You never see yourself in the game, it is always from your perspective. However this game had a few comments about our character that made it very interesting about who WE are. 

In the second game you can influence the story more than the first game. By doing certain actions, like getting their drinks wrong or right, or forgetting to give them certain items,  you will have some different outcomes in how the story progresses for good or bad for some of the characters. You may even stop seeing customers if you mess up their drinks too often! Or if you give them the right drink or the right item you will see extra story content for some of the customers.  

I had no crashes and the game supports widescreen. All you really need is your mouse to play. There is some light comedy, some heartfelt moments and some serious undertones to some of the characters' stories. A great game told through the stories of your customers as you, the ever present, caring barista listens on. 

A hug of appreciation for Mohammad Fahmi (may he rest in peace) and his entire team for forging ahead to bring the world of Coffee Talk to the fans again. It was well worth the wait and I think he would be so proud of the final game and the entire team.  I recommend both games, and honestly encourage everyone to start with playing the first one.

5939,137047888.0,1752060,"""Wild Dogs"" is a cool retro styled platformer in the vein of the classic Contra games. 
 
The game follows the typical run-and-gun platformer format, but occasionally the game-play changes into a fixed-screen shooter or precision platformer.

Expect hordes of alien and robotic enemies and lots of mini-bosses (I'm currently in the middle of stage 2 and I've already encountered 6). 

The game's difficulty is on the higher side, so you'll likely need to replay each level a few times to practice and get the hang of things. 

Visually, this game features lovely monochrome pixel art, with color palettes that are reminiscent of the classic Gameboy. The tilesets and character sprites are beautiful and add to the overall nostalgic feel of the game.

The Bad:
 Limited weapon selection as of writing this.
 Some of the weapons feel rather useless until they are almost fully upgraded.
 
The Ugly:
 As of writing this, there are a few progression breaking bugs around menuing and interacting.

Summary. Altogether for the price this is an interesting take on a fairly new genre, and a love letter to the grindhouse horror scene.",1.0

5948,137048737.0,2207490,"I'm not gonna lie - I'm pretty impressed. I wasn't expecting to be, since I generally do not enjoy 'Idle' games.  The developer of the original 'Factory Town' game (a VERY casual but enjoyable 3D city builder) has taken his game, and distilled many of the great aspects of the core game loop down to the most essential elements - which also removes the 3D building aspect - leaving only the 'town management' aspect of the game remaining.

A town management simulator. It's enjoyable. It's minimalist. It hits all the right areas of the brain while playing, like a good 'Skinner Box' type game should. And since it's an 'Idle' game, you can play for awhile, log off to go have a life, then come back to additional progress that has been made while you were away.

Thankfully, the Dev does not (nor will he ever) use/abuse those mechanics to force players into micro-transactions like many other games do.  You get the whole game, immediately, with nothing else to purchase, ever.  A good game from a good Dev, with a good track record of quality and attention to the development process.

5960,137049132.0,1928870,"It's graphically charming the game functions for the most part, but it feels very hollow. 

It feels like an RTS in name only. The outposts you build are usually just going to be for fast travel purposes. The villages already make resources for you. Due to how enemy mobilizes (or rather, how they don't mobilize) their armies in this game, you don't have to really think about building outposts to hold off the enemy from occupying a space or to cut them off from resources. Besides the attack and occasional new base every night, the piglin army are just sitting there waiting for you.

In terms of action and combat tactics the game also feels very limited. Defensively, the upgrades you can get to your building feel like they're just an afterthought when just spamming walls and arrow towers already suffices. Offensively, it's just a cycle of leading a bunch of stone golems to rush a few buildings in the enemy base, retreating to make more, and then bringing out your creepers to nuke the nether portal when the enemy's defenses are down. 

Where I think the game could've salvaged itself was to have a lot of interesting side content in the world and a good campaign. Sadly, I found that the game failed on both these fronts too. Besides some admittedly helpful mounts, you just find some resources laying around + some golems and towers that I really never got much use out of. The story feels like it's aimed strictly at an extremely young audience. Nearly all the cutscenes featuring the horde being the exact same joke of a commander Piglin bullying the smaller ones. Your allies has scripts written on wooden that hasn't been turned to paper yet, with only one of them even attempting to say even slightly amusing things and still fumbling at that.",0.0

5965,137051653.0,2346510,"Honestly, for being an indie fighting game, what this game manages to achieve is MORE than impressive. While issues I'll get into later have kept me from experiencing all it has to offer, I can say that from the perspective of a fighting game fan I was very surprised by how much care went into it. 

First off, the roster. There are seven characters, which is a really big roster for an indie fighter. The best indie fighting game, them's fighting herds, only launched with six. I was also really happy with how much life went into the animations. Despite basing the characters on simple colors, the devs went out of their way to make each character filled with expressive and fun animations that really help the game feel polished. Each character is fun to control, helped by smooth universal movement. The archetypes cover your standard shotos, zoners, grapplers, and rushdowns, but also have some weird ones. Of particular note is Violet. While there have been characters who clone themselves in past fighting games, I don't think I've ever seen a character like Violet, who freely switches between her clones and has multiple ways to use them. It's obvious the developers knew what they were doing, and managed to fit as much depth as possible within these small movesets.

The overall system mechanics are quite fun too. While it seems quite simple at first, there is a lot of polish on display here. The combo system is pretty intuitive, with a lot of depth under the surface (helped by a roman cancel system like guilty gear). I am a bit worried that there isn't enough defensive mechanics, given how fast crossups can be in this game, but it is too early in the game's meta to make any conclusive statements about that. 

I've praised the animations, but I have some problems with the overall graphics. Im very happy the devs do give an epilepsy warning on the steam page, as this game can be kind of intense to look at, however there is another problem. The big problem is the lifebars. They're stylish, but I think they're so stylish they start to hurt gameplay. Their shape and inconsistent colors can make checking how much health you have left more frustrating than it should be. A small issue, yes, but in a genre as fast paced as fighting games, this can cause issues. There's a reason most fighting games have simpler looking lifebars. The super meter isn't as big a deal because they give you a number on the side to easily check how much meter you have. As for the soundtrack, unfortunately due to technical issues on my end I couldn't listen to it. (this is definitely not this game's fault, my computer just has some issues, but it does mean I couldn't hear the ost sadly.)

There is one last issue, the online. It's laggy and buggy and doesn't work very well. I'd love to play the game more, but I just find the online annoying to deal with. Im sure the devs know about this and are working on it, but for now, that is a major issue.

Overall, if I had to describe this title in one word, it would be polish... except for the online. The animations? Great. The movesets? Fun. The mechanics? Interesting. The online? Bad. It's a shame, because for a free game, this is quite a great deal. The game is still worth your time, but perhaps stick to local matches until the bugs are ironed out.",1.0

5976,137049163.0,2321210,"This game is amazing. I would likely recommend for anyone that likes roguelike or metroidvania games.
Before getting into a few nitpicky things that I think could greatly improve this game when the game is completed, I would like to start off by saying the music, art, and combat are all amazing. I have played AAA games that didn't come close to being as good as this.

For things I would like to see improve as the devs continue to work on it:
- The English dub. There is one, voices are fine but several words are pronounced incorrectly (""mecha"" being pronounced ""meh-cha"" being the most noticeable)
- No PS4 controller prompts
- The skill that activates with Y or triangle. You have to time it's usage perfectly to get max out of it. I would love to see it filling in sync with the music, opposed to increasing and decreasing over time and having to monitor it.

For anyone interested, this game is 100% worth the price. If you are fine with a Chinese dub I would recommend using that over the English. I have seen some people say that controllers do not work; they do. I have played with a PS4 controller with no issues.",1.0

5985,137053169.0,1537830,"Disney Speedstorm at its core is a fast paced, action packed racer with very catchy music and visually nice boards, beyond that there are some good points and bad points.

The bad points are there are too many currencies. Currently there are blue tokens from various sources, yellow tokens from the battle pass, and light purple tokens from multiplayer, plus other one off tokens for free boxes. If they want to avoid problems going forward they need to combine systems for ease of access

As mentioned this game as loot boxes, of a sort. Some boxes offer purely cosmetic items for your character or car, the main box though which you buy with battle pass currency gives you a chance at getting crew for your car (which increases your racing stats in the wake of not being able to change kart)  or racer tokens which is how your character levels up, but it not their racing level, more on that in a second

Character leveling and racing levels is where I think this game is going to make or break itself. Your character has a star rating, better star rating better stats and abilities. They also have a racing level which dictates what level difficulty you are capable of doing, but sadly it also affects stats, meaning that if you are a level 5 racer and queue for ranked, you may very well race off against people who are level 10 and able to go MUCH faster than you. Some may view the system as an incentive to keep playing to get more items and subsequently and get better, others may not.

The good points are the game actually feels very good to drive, it’s got very tight steering, nice manual boosting and character specific battle items that make the game fit to your style of racing, personally I prefer ramming people off the board so I play Donald 😊. Compared to Nickelodeons kart racers, this feels much better and in some ways feels better than Mario Kart

The tracks, while few in number for early access, in my opinion do feel varied based on the fact there are 4 different version of each track to where each race you’ll have a moment of “which version is this?” And I personally enjoy that.

The music which is a mix of new songs and remixes from their corresponding franchises (Mulan features a remix of Ill make a man out of you for example) fits well. Personally I think the music is great and really pumps you up for a good time..

Realistically, if you look at the game as a whole with all its pluses and minuses and have the sense it is early access, I think it ranks more of a 7, 7.5/10

If you are looking for a Mario kart clone, go play Mario kart. This game isn’t trying to be Mario kart, it’s trying to be its own racing game and calling every racing game that comes out a Mario kart clone seems unfair bias

[*]It seems to be the same as the old game just with a new look and camera angle. The old game had a better UI and it was easier to read the information you needed because it was all in one place and not all over the screen. The new camera angle makes it rough to plan unless you zoom all the way out anyways. (Kind of like you can zoom in and look at units in Starcraft but no one plays like that.)
[*]The tutorial seems to be more puzzle like then the actual game and does not really teach you much you would not already know by the point you get to it.

But I kept going back to doing light-heavy attack combos way more since it's more reliable on groups of enemies. Then when there's boss combat, I kept doing the same thing, until I realize, wait, I could steal the boss' magic and deal more damage! Basically, stealing enemy attack is fun, but it takes a lot of preparation, not to mention aiming at that one fire mage in a clump of ice mages clumped together is hard. It could've done better. There's a lot of interesting mechanics, and I respect the experimentation of these mechanics.

Voicelines, I was expecting voicelines at the least with how much I paid for.
The Art, It's amazing at the start until some missions just repeat the same boring maps unlike at the start of the game and the main hub.. I need more environmental detail and better character art.

Raining Rocks: what the heck is up with the rocks falling on the boss arena while the boss is doing an AOE attack as I sit in a tiny platform??? And I could barely see them coming since they are random yet fast. I feel like that's illegal. It's just annoying.

Simplistic Level Design. Sylas hooking to a rod is just to get funky outside of combat is what it feels like.

The skip button, why can't you just make it instant? Or at least an option to? I have to sit there and watch the animation on fast forward every time, there's no point to it.

Simple looting style can be frustrating and losing weapons by accidentally discarding them can happen frequently. 

Three resources to build and craft make for easy dynamics. 

Shelter becomes irrelevant when defenses are built up enough, i have found myself with more resource farming items than anything else. 

Game is worth it for those who found Project Zomboid too intense. For those who like zombie games, i would buy on a discount/sale.

A little sarcasm and comedy, an interesting twist on human fate, and gameplay that is immediately engaging and ramps up quickly.  Some of the best parts for me include ""No Hopes"" where you can greatly modify the gameplay by enabling difficulty modifiers and, in various combinations, create a completely different experience. I was super fortunate and got access to the beta for a bit as well as the playtest weekend. I saw some discussion in the game's official Discord during the playtest weekend, and the developers seemed very engaged and willing to make the game the best experience for players possible. I came away from that chomping at the bit for a chance to own uninterrupted access to the game and with excitement for the possible future of the game, as the roadmap shows some pretty awesome potential that I cannot wait to see come to fruition.  

Now, not to take away from my overall glowing review, the store page said there would be Steam Leaderboards, but I don't see that feature anywhere in the game currently, and while I don't think it is critical to the game play at all, as I can still go into discord and dunk on my friends manually, it would be cool to have something to show off what I can do passively.",1.0

6054,106992717.0,1289340,"Even though I have posted have a positive review, I don't recommend the game as of now.

It is still in EA and for the time being, you don't get too much content. At best, you can maybe squeeze 3-4 hours of fun out of the game, before it gets repetitive, and you start to find out the limitations of it. The campaigns get pretty repetitive, it's just the location that's changing, the AI is sometimes struggling and the whole restaurant management gimmick is kind of basic as of now (the only thing you're really in charge of, is how much food you want to buy and how much the food costs).

You can place a toilet in the middle of your restaurant and nobody will seem to care, they'll just go to it without a care. You can serve everyone food from the ground, and they'll still give you 5 stars (but rats might steal some of it, so there's that I guess?)... You can do a lot of stuff that seems illogical, and the game doesn't care. As I said, still basic.

Now though, why did I leave a positive review anyway?
Because the developer seems to read the forum a bit and tries to fix the game and make it better. As of now, they're also still working hard on the game, so it wasn't abandoned still (who knows what the future might bring though). If you're looking for a *basic* restaurant tycoon, this might be worth your money (on a sale), and it has the potential to grow bigger in the future.

If you read the review in a few months from now, and you still see that the game is getting updated, and nice content is being implemented, buy it (I think 2 more campaigns were added since the game was released, not even a year ago).
If you check and there were no new updates for a long time... I would recommend you to stay away from it. The current price tag isn't worth the content you'll be getting right now, and your money is most likely better spent elsewhere.",1.0

6064,87801046.0,1289340,"A cute little restaurant sim. It's pretty basic right now (in early access) and once you hit your stride it turns into a bit of a resource management game, but otherwise it's pretty fun.

Pros:
- Nice art style
- Straight-forward gameplay
- Resource management is fun—managing repeat ingredient orders, menu prices, etc
- Has decent replayability
- The scenarios are fun/challenging

Cons:
- Things sometimes get buggy (stairs aren't movable or staff can't navigate out of a room, even though there's a door or space to move, staff won't do their prioritized job, etc)
- No music to play along to, which makes things... quiet
- It IS early access, but the features are quite limited in terms of how closely you can manage things (could include staff pay/skill management, specialty training for certain foods/ingredients)
- Building tools and decor are very limited

A few recommendations to the developer:

I recommend adding female staff models and names, and perhaps some non-binary models and names. 

I would really like to be able to move an item on the first floor to the top floor! I have to delete the item and buy a new one, which is a bit frustrating. 

It would be helpful to have an information panel that tracks which staff feel overloaded and in what area (do I need more cleaners? More waitstaff? More cooks?). 

I wish there were more ways to increase the flow of customers. Lowering prices works somewhat, but not really enough when you get a big operation going. Maybe add an advertisement feature to drum up extra business (to your benefit or detriment!). Maybe you could also add a random chance for a food critic to enter the building, and based on that pawn's experience it could give you a popularity boost or stifle business. 

Other recommendations are mostly to add additional content, but that is already in the works!

I would also like to point out the lack of diversity in this game. I know it's just a game, but I find it odd that there are exclusively male workers in the game, especially since they already have female characters in the game (I also noticed male guests would have naked legs when using the toilet, but females would keep their pants on and cross their legs - not a big issue and may be an oversight but I found it odd). Add on to that that there are only white characters - I don't imagine it can be too difficult to apply a small variety of skintones? I really hope the game will improve on that as it continues to develop, it would be nice to see more diversity.

1. Would be good to zoom out a little further.

I think its a neat little restaurant sim that has potential. The scenarios are fun and challenging but feel fair, after about 7 hours i 3 Star'd all the ones available. The ingredients, cooking, worker, money, stock, delivery strategy & gameplay is fun and feels balanced. The biggest issue that plagues this game is lack of information and lack of more indepth content. Its hard to get a good balance of what i need more or less of when all i can really do is eyeball it, no graphs or UI information on how much of X im using, workers claim to be busy but idk if thats my waiters, cooks, janitors, or bus boys. A graph or two could EASILY fix this issue and i hope to see the dev implement this. For indepth content... Currently the game is a 1 trick pony, its a really good trick but its still one trick. I would like to see mechanics that occur in games like Rimworld or Prison Architecht where maybe professional reviewers visit the restaurant and can really harm or boost customers based on their review.

TLDR: Early access REEEE, Dev on good path. Approve of content for price.

Charming roguelike that changes each run, but has a selection of handcrafted rooms, so you can get a feel for where traps, secrets, puzzle solutions and enemies will be located on repeat playthroughs

Pros
+Chill music
+Nice pixel art and animation (even the grass is dancing)
+Characters are likeable and remarkably zen seeing as their whole world and existence ends each day
+You can have unique builds quite quickly and get given a new super power at the start of each run
+Enemies can set off traps and harm each other. Sometime it's fun to sit back and enjoy the chaos
+Achieve stuff even on short runs as unique stories unfold and new items get unlocked

Meh
~A lot of roguelikes have a fast travel option, but the schtick of this game is the rooms gradually get filled up with fire as you explore forcing you to push forward. So tactical exploring is a necessity and teleporting around would make this unique level destruction idea redundant. Personally I quite like it, but does mean backtracking a fair bit. At least the slain enemies stay dead.
~It's pretty difficult. There are some bees in the first area that seem OP and snipe you with an undodgeable bullet so you always need to be aware of where they are.
~The game does actually save your run as you quit (which I love), but the game doesn't say ""save and quit"". This might lead people to thinking they are having to throw a run when they have to leave the game.

Cons
-Some power ups are straight up bad. There's one where you become a bomb and blow up, losing a heart each time. I just reset my run when I get this.

Tips
+Try and get the ghost bullet upgrade (my fave). You can hide behind walls and kill enemies without facing them and also cheese some of the switch puzzles.
+Activate ""highlight enemies"" in the options. It certainly helps (especially with the aforementioned bees!
+Try to head towards the question marks on the map. They are always rooms that will improve your run.
[spoiler] +You can blow up some walls with bombs. The wall to the left of Guitarboy at the start always has a secret [/spoiler]
[spoiler] +You can cheese some of the more challenging switch activated doors by dropping a bomb on the switch and activating when you get to the door [/spoiler]
[spoiler] +There is a character that can permanently add certain info to your map, so you can strategise where to head to each run [/spoiler]
[spoiler] Try to save up 1000 coins for the cow man. (You only need to do this once). Then when you find a missing cow you can heal yourself for one heart and get a free item [/spoiler]

The reward systems for the daily/seasonal activities feel underwhelming and honestly not worth it at times. You will find yourself grinding for countless hours trying to get one specific upgrade, only to get locked right back out for not having another item.

This game is fantastic, currently in the top 100 of all players on Ranked Multiplayer. I highly recommend this game if you are a racing game fan. The gameplay is solid, tracks are fun and unique, not a single track blends together with another one, unless you're counting variants, but each variant sections off certain portions of the track. The game is easy to pick up and play. I thought it was going to take me a while to understand how it works, but I was getting top 3 positions without issue shortly after my first few races. The soundtrack is godlike, and I wish more people were willing to try it out now. 

My only issue is latency online, but I think it's because the game isn't overly popular in the United States quite yet, because I've been matching with a lot of people from Europe and Asia, so some latency is to be expected.

The gameplay, while not the deepest, has some good depth to it with the combos you can perform and the amount of spells you can choose to play with. 
The enemy variety is great as well, from Mageseekers to Demacian wildlife there is a lot to fight.

If you're interested in the world of Runeterra this is definitely worth your time, though the Deluxe Edition isn't worth your money I'd say, the extra content you get doesn't really add much to the gameplay when you consider the price bump.

6105,137062186.0,1681060,"While 'mixed' seems fair right now, I think this could be something special.

Truth be told, a mix of Evil Genius and Stargate SG-1 is right up my alley. So, yes, rose tinted glasses. But the fundamentals seem fine, as they say. You build a base around your gateway, recruit a team of gaters (I will always read this as 'gators'), explore new worlds and research the things you bring back for fun and profit. It works and it's fun! Up to a point.

For it to go from 'interesting and fun' to 'great!', I think these areas need some tweaking or reworking:
- Medical: it's a weird, obtuse system that locks in both the patient and the medic, with the medic walking endlessly from the medicine cabinet to the patient, who seems to not recover one iota unless being fed drugs. Medicine that delivers it's effect over a longer period, and thus needs to be applied less frequently, would already be a huge step up. It would also open the door for different kinds of medicines, which could generate interesting choices.
- Missions: the narrative focus can use a lot of tightening and some more visuals. I discovered a friendly alien civilization and all I got were these three lines of dialogue. Something like that. But also: some indications as to what could be expected (perhaps a drone you send through on a much shorter mission?) would be invaluable. As would still getting basic rewards from missions that turn out to be story missions.
- Menemies: this is in part the medical problem, as your downed soldier stay downed for what feels like eons. But also: doors are purely aesthetic right now; why do all the other gaters train on the shooting range, but refuse to pick up a rifle; I would like to prioritize targets (so it's not just three one on one fights that I will lose); I would also like an iris to close the gate, perhaps delaying the invasions?

In general the game could also use more information on pretty much everything, and some tweaking to the interface, so that it's possible to view and edit the teams on the galaxy map, for example.

But all this criticism comes from a place of love. I really hope this one can deliver on its promise.",1.0

Managing money is challenging as your only source of income from the materials your gaters will come back with.
Anyway, send all your gaters to other planet before they quit cause you cant pay then, and selling the ping-pong table wont cover it.

6108,137060959.0,1308360,"I think it does a good job of incorporating a rhythm dynamic into an fps and the core gameplay elements of Gun Jam are quite addictive!

The compact and minimal UI is sleek and uninhibited on the action frame while the general graphic design, with pulsing and vibrant colours on all levels, is fantastic and gives the game a certain charm. The most defining aspect however, has to be the soundtrack which, whilst spanning multiple genres, sounds massive and explosive and delivers a great beat-driven shooting session. The option to be able to add your own music to the game is a nice touch too!

On the other hand, there's not a lot of content to play with at this time and the possibilities for customisation of characters and level design seems yet to be fully explored. Also, if the game had a story mode which possibly gave more depth and background to the main characters I think this could enhance the game's replay value even further.

You play as a bear who delivers food to other animals (with orders being shown through the UBear Eats, accessible by pressing C), but the food's essentially scattered around the campsite by humans. It's your job to sneak through the campsite in order to retrieve said food for your customers. I like the stealth part, but having to throw items is a bit more complicated than I thought it would be. Your M1 button *is* working, you just need to hold M2 to aim before you can throw. As an avid ragdoll enjoyer from my time in Source Engine games, I can also say that the ragdolls here are pretty alright. They collide with the ground as one would expect, though limbs feel a bit too loose, particularly the bear's arms. One other note, having him pull out two tree branches as a disguise is so stupid, but the fact that it actually somehow works is just the icing on the cake.",1.0

6189,137064593.0,1867520,"I only played for an hour but I really like this game already. It runs smoothly, it has great graphics, great voice actors, a compelling story and it immerses you into the game. You actually tend to the plants and move leaves around to look for fruit to harvest. You use your spells in every aspect. I feel like they've improved a bit on the witch life sim. This is totally worth the original price, I was honestly surprised it was only $20 with as much effort it seems has been put into the story. 

The only cons I see so far is a bug I've encountered when having played for an hour and tending to all the plants I did, it stopped letting my view change around the plant as my character moves around it to see the leaves and fruits better. The view stayed in one spot and it was a bit hard to harvest at times. The bug does go away if you close the game out and reopen the save. 

The other thing I've had happen was when I read too fast and blighted the plant, it was taking so long for it to heal that I just made a new save. I'm impatient. And read too fast. So read slowly and follow the prompts! Would be nice to get the warning BEFORE channeling rather than after channeling. :D 

A suggestion for quality of life would be to allow crafting from chests as storage is a grid. I can see it becoming a headache. Also allowing different types of things to be queued for crafting instead of just one item at a time (but can do multiples of one item).

Also there's a typo in the first mail message you're sent, haha.

There is heart and care in this game but some of the execution in my opinion falls short. Stealing enemy spells is fun. Your own spells later on also become strong. However, there is the limiting resource that is mana to cast your own spells and not the stolen ones (stolen ones are free to cast and on cooldown how often you can steal from an enemy). You gain mana with your physical attacks aka punching stuff. Problem being is that some of the bigger tankier enemies require more than one cast of spell element they're weak too. They're also aggresive with their attacks. This leads to a situation where you're doing short combos at times to build up your mana for one more spell cast just to take a small chunk of their health bar.

This problem is further compounded in some boss fights where the boss can have long attack combos, animations or damage effects on the ground that linger. This leads to you having enough time to land 2-3 hits unless you wanna take damage. Another problem is the perspective or camera angle. There has been numerous times where an enemy would be hidden completely behind an object and you have no idea they are preparing an attack. Also sometimes enemies will just shoot at you from off the screen.

Then there are the bugs. Sometimes you will just be unable to attack but can still move. Other times the reverse can happen where you can not move but can still attack. Enemies can clip into walls or objects and thus become untargetable (at least you can still hit them attacks if you aim directly and run up to them).

Finally a small design gripe with one of the bosses from me. Minor spoilers but you eventually unlock Ultimate Spells. There is a boss in this game where none of your Ultimate Spells work on it. As in the game won't even let you cast them. My guess is that it is because this boss can not be targeted.",0.0

It's a pretty realistic survival game (no weird monsters or fantasy elements), which presents you with a lot of the challenges you'd also face in reality. From the obvious unfriendly animals, over weather effects like sun, wind, rain and related illnesses, injuries e.g. when crafting in the dark, and of course your own needs for food and water etc.
There's a day/night-cycle and crafting actually costs time (it's fast in realtime, but could represent an hour or 2 in the game for example), which I like very much.
There are 4 different difficulties you can choose from, but I think if you're looking for a truly relaxing experience, you should look elsewhere. Although compared to the demo, they definitly made ""normal"" (the 2nd of 4 diffs) easier, especially those killer birds :D
There are a lot of things to craft and build, including boats to explore other islands. You can also explore the underwater world.
In addition to that, there's a story. I can't say much about the story yet, as there wasn't too much of it in the demo and I'm not far into this EA version, but the survival part alone is fun and challenging enough for me to recommend this game already.
It looks good, the atmosphere is awesome, and I haven't encountered any bugs yet (there were also not many in the demo and rarely, if ever, game-breaking). I feel like there's some optimization still needed though.
You can also rebind your keys.

The devs are amazing, very involved with their community and receptive to feedback, which was already very visible during the time the demo was available and got new/tweaked features and fixes. It's also apparent that they already included some more of the demo feedback into this EA version of the game.

6228,137069363.0,1663220,"Honestly, I was not sure what to expect in this game. I was expecting something new and something familiar since I have already played the first game a while back. At the same time, I did not hold high hopes to see all our favorite faces from the first game. This game, however, exceeded my expectations by bringing back basically EVERYONE from the first game and introducing new patrons to our mysterious barista.

How this game differs from the first one is that emotion expressions seem a little more explicit and fun this time. Old characters have all grown a little and it is nice to see them again, sharing their new conflicts in life. I simply adore how the new characters interact with some of our old faces, which is what brings the two games together cohesively.

The game has also introduced some new features, which can drastically alter the endings for some characters, and I love it. It gives you more reasons to deviate from trying to reach the perfect ending unlike the last game, of course with the help of achievements.

Overall, lovely game that makes me want to look forward to another episode in the future, though the endings in both games are satisfying enough to call it a day. In fact, I would say the second game (this one) did even better than the last one.",1.0

There are multiple ways to do it and it is very creative. I liked the hand-drawn scenes, there are so many details, and the fun part, the game is fully voiced.

The puzzles are challenging, we were three playing this game together and we struggled with some of the puzzles which needs lots of analysis and reading through in order to solve them. There is a hinting system that I accidentally used as it is next to the inventory, unfortunately, I lost the achievement of not using it because of that.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2965290572

The only criticism I have is for the soundtracks, there is almost none to be mentioned, the game is 80% silent, I prefer to hear more of the background music while I'm playing, it gives a good addition to the atmosphere. You can also navigate the chapters through the main menu and can replay to a chapter after finishing it from where you have left if you miss any of the evidence, you don't need to reply to the whole mission.  
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2965292865

Pros:
+Interesting stories and methods of getting rid of the bodies.
+Unique gameplay.
+Good puzzles.
+Good game length.
+Hinting system
+Chapters select.
+Steam achievements.

Cons:
-The soundtrack doesn't play throughout the whole game, the game is almost silent.
-The hinting button next to the inventory, you could click it by mistake and lose the achievement for not using it. 

This is a perfect game for people who enjoys puzzles. I highly recommend it, it is so fun, and would love to see more games like this. Will be waiting for the third game.

Setting is fun, colors are great, monsters are pretty interesting but I unfortunately had to call it quits regardless. AI for certain enemies is kinda weird in my experience, even in 'safe houses' some enemies will just stay and persist despite hiding yourself from them offering little to no down time. The game can get a little too dark (as you make blood spheres) and coupling that with the effects when being pursued (aberration and distortion) it feels really muddy and for some actually painful lol. The size of the map is quite daunting and a tad bit empty (maybe add some more interesting landmarks / visual storytelling if you want to keep it massive). I played with friends and we all kind of wanted to hang out and travel together/banter, but maybe you're suppose to ""spread out"" to cover such a large map effectively.

If you've ever wished for a game that combines the best elements of Hearts of Iron, Men of War, and Hell Let Loose, then this game is definitely worth checking out. It's a modern Grand Strategy game that seamlessly integrates Realpolitiks II's diplomatic, economic, and military gameplay with the Real Time Strategy of Call to Arms and the First Person Shooter mechanics of Insurgency: Sandstorm and WW3.

The game features a Quick-battle mode that allows players to quickly jump into the action and experience the different gameplay mechanics. The graphics and sound are also impressive, with realistic military units, weapons, and landscapes, and fitting soundtrack.

One of the best things about this game is its unique combination of gameplay elements. The Grand Strategy aspect allows players to control and manage their nation's economy, diplomacy, and military, while the Real Time Strategy mode lets players command their troops in battles and skirmishes. The First Person Shooter mode adds an immersive layer to the gameplay, allowing players to experience the action up close and personal.

The game is not without its flaws, however. Some players may find the learning curve steep, especially if they're not familiar with the different gameplay elements. The AI could also use some improvement, particularly in the FPS mode.

Overall, this game is a must-play for fans of Grand Strategy, Real Time Strategy, and First Person Shooter games. Its unique combination of gameplay elements makes it a refreshing and exciting addition to the genre. With the promise of multiplayer and coop modes in the future, this game is definitely one to watch.",1.0

The cases here are akin to Ace Attorney where not everything is as simple as it seems, which kept my interests throughout the whole game with its twists and turns.

The gameplay is very similar to Ace Attorney, with you examining scenes and gathering evidence, then having a rebuttal with suspects and witnesses. 

Key Differences :
- There is no 'Press' mechanic for testimonies. What you hear is what you have to work with.
   This can be a plus or a down for some depending on your stance on pressing testimonies in other games.

- Presenting Evidence is easier in Normal difficulty. Instead of choosing from a hoard of evidence, the game chooses a few (1-4) evidence that could or could not be relevant to the testimony at hand. All you need to do is figure out which evidence is the right one and to present it on which statement.
[Note : I played the game on Normal, I'm unsure of how it is on 'Enjoy the Story' and 'Challenge' difficulty]

I don't understand Chinese too well, so I played the game in English. The translation is pretty good, but there are some word breaking ( exa- *next line* -mple) that makes reading a bit tedious. I can't really say anything
about the voice acting since I don't understand them, but I do enjoy them! The voices fit the characters.

Overall, I really enjoyed the game! As a fan of Ace Attorney games, this game hit a lot of right spots with the
story, characters, and mysteries.

The Mageseeker is a good little game for those who want to know more about the rising of mages within Demacia although, that's about it.

The gameplay is solid, if not a little stagnant. You can mostly get through the entire game with a few repeatable button combinations. I felt the shop items were added as unlocks but very linear in nature. It's almost the illusion of being a non linear game.

I never felt the battles were truly big until the last third of the game. I played the game on a balanced difficulty and had to repeat a few bosses before I found a way to breeze the game through. 

It really needs voice acting. The conversations were a little dry and would be a lot more interesting if they had voices to accompany them.

I enjoyed seeing the progression of the story and it didn't feel too repetitive. It is what it is, a little lore enrichment while not being the premium AAA game. Good to play if your a league of legends lore fan.

Otherwise, i'd maybe give this a skip.

It's not quite an RTS, which makes this game a lot easier to pick up due to simple and intuitive controls, but it also has a high enough ceiling to keep things interesting. 
Units can be commanded in a single groups, class or type and each has their own use.
Building is really easy to do on the fly (note that my sensitivity was very high, 80%) but it is also great to take some time to get a perfect setup. 
The resource gathering is simple and can be done while running through the world or while building, so it doesn't become boring at all.
A few minor bugs here and there but nothing game breaking or terrible (the fact that legendary units stopped working was annoying but the final boss being finished in about 20 seconds means it's not too horrible).

I like the combo system, which forces you to play aggressively and barrel through doors without knowing what's on the other side.

Yes, repeat all of the very easy first levels, all over again, and again, and again.
Not to mention the fact that the music is rendered in such a way that it loses all its sound quality, and that the entire game is in black and white for no apparent reason, and enemies are unable to open doors but can quick-peek you from across the map.

There are no 'normal' attacks - all opponents either attack you with a blue attack that you MUST parry or a red attack that you MUST dodge making the combat feel like a big QTE instead of giving you tactical options and the choice of when do you wish to simply block or now risk for a parry but potentially get a bigger reward. And since this game tries to be a souls-like, the combat makes or breaks it...

Had the game launched without some of these terrible bugs and had the devs made some adjustments to the combat itself, this game could have easily been a 7/10, especially for its asking price...

Desktop Dungeons is a game developed and published by QCF Design

The game offers some nice graphics and a beautiful aesthetic which is pleasant all the same and has some amazing attention to detail even though it is a little rough around the edges

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless and ends just at the right time

Desktop Dungeons overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a really good rougelike RPG puzzle game to play in short bursts!

There are a lot of things to break down about the game design but overall I'd say many of the choices the designers made are clearly well-thoughtout and manage to take Hotline Miami's frantic combat while still making it playable as a Roguelite. The player has a proper healthbar, and its pretty generous, too. You can't really have a roguelite if you had Hotline Miami's ""dying every 5 seconds"" mechanic. It still manages to be extremely frantic as the Combo Meter directly increases the coins you get, which then helps the Roguelite aspect. Honestly it's impressive how the designer has broken fundamental staples of Hotline Miami and Roguelites and still managed to get the best of both worlds.

The sound effects are great. The music is awesome...it sounds like... you are in the depths of hell. It is..... really really hard. I have done... nearly 30 runs..... I have Giant Grapes. I usually use Abe because of the +1 projectiles. Now....it being difficult is not insomuch the issue.... however....there is this meta progression.... and herein lies the issue... in my 30 runs.... I don't feel.... all parts of the meta progression... I see the healing sure.... and SOME.... of the damage...and I can clearly see... that I have more health. If I were to rate this game now? I would give it.... an 8.7 out of 10.... you KIND of feel like you feel stronger when you put points into strength.... and you KIND of feel like.... I took a few points less damage when you put them into Armor. Armor.... seems nearly useless.... at max it mitigates 5.5 hp of damage. However, to me...armor is not the issue. For one thing... Ice Orb and Radioactive Skull....are supposed to slow enemies down yes? Or possibly freeze them. For Ice Orb. I find that Ice Orb rarely freezes...very rarely. This issue I am finding is.... those eagles? that start coming in? are... just too tanky... I know they are meant to be hard... but that second wave of them.... is a little bit skewed. They are insane. I would like to see them have....idk... maybe 10% less health? I have tried a ton of different combos... and none of them seem to work...I get swarmed. The best way to deal with them? Stand between obstacles. The ONE time I did make it to The Mortician? I have no idea how I made it there. Luck. And then he killed me after about 45 seconds. I would like to see... either a redoing of Armor.... because you really can't tell when you have it.... I have Armor maxed out on my game.... but still I get hit for 4 points of damage after a few minutes from them? I really really like this game.... and I will eventually beat this first level.... but it's super hard. I can't feel too much meta progression. It may turn people away.

6385,137076928.0,1681060,"Great idea but poor (I hope yet) implementation.
Many problems have already been pointed out in other reviews but I still remind of it.

[list]
[*] Unbalanced and unforgiving economics. You virtually can't get past the midgame without using F9 console with money cheat code.

[*] Broken gaters priorities. Medics can do anything but treat patients. Soldiers can go sleep or eat right before the invasion.

[*] Almost absent defensive capabilities. No turrets. Doors are totally senseless and useless. Soldiers level doesn’t affect their fighting abilities.

[*] Dubious UI decisions. For example, you have to manually assign exosuit for one and every gater who goes on a misson. And if you reassign exosuit rack to another gater while exosuit is still on, the former owner of exosuit doesn’t return it to rack. Well, yes, you can use this bug as a feature, making gaters always wear exosuits, but come on, there’re better ways to manage equipment, right?

[*] Bugs, bugs and more bugs. Gaters freeze in middle of action. Enemies freeze in the midst of a fight. Absent data research options. Yeah, I understand this is Early Access. But still.

6395,137078234.0,2189860,"This game is tough. I really want to like it, but it's entering the market when so many other games in the genre are just flat out better.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
1) Great concept with the comic book style scenarios.
2) Adding quests to this style of game is a good concept.
3) The body horror is a welcome change to the standard fantasy skin these games tend to have.
4) 10 playable characters to start is great.
5) Excellent graphics, especially with scanlines enabled. Really gives that 90s feel.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
1) No Deck support. Tried using multiple versions of Proton/GE, no success.
2) In under 2 hours of gameplay, I soft locked twice losing two different 6000+ kill runs. 
3) Cutscenes are awkward and skipping them goes line by line, despite the text never changing. 
4)Weapon balance is non-existent, every run that I've taken all single-handed weapons has been far, far easier. Two handed weapons seem to be much worse. This might be character specific, but I wouldn't know, because:
5) No explanation of weapons, characters, skills, etc. Maybe I overlooked how you can check these things, but in game there did not seem to be a way to check damage, health, skills, even the items only show a one-time pop-up as to what they do.
6) Some runs, weapons would not be able to be improved. It seemed to happen with melee weapons more frequently, but some weapons would just get stuck at level 1. If you chose to upgrade them, it would stay at the same level and you would be offered the same upgrade choices next time. Is this intentional?
7) Meta progression is t e r r i b l e. You collect money at an agonizingly slow pace. In 1.5 hours of gameplay, I was roughly 1/4 of the way to purchasing my FIRST upgrade. There are also very few, uninteresting choices for spending money. They need to add character specific progression, or change the way money is gained. Maybe this picks up as sessions go longer, but I don't feel compelled to find out.
8) Damage is not indicated properly. When a car explodes off screen, I get a big scary red screen flash. When an enemy is crawling on my skin, no screen change aside from health bar rapidly dropping.

As it stands, I'm not sure how this game can justify 2x the cost of Vampire Survivors for a small percentage of the content, less polish, and no real defining features outside of the theme. I really want to love this game. I'm going to hold out hope that the devs address the issues and polish this up, because I think it has a solid base that can be built on.",0.0

6425,137077041.0,1289340,"Really a half-baked game that shouldn't be out of early access. To be a management game, it's really at the bare minimum. A super limited, inconsistent, and unbalanced choice of furniture and decorations. Virtually no upgrades (if you need more capacity, you just place more of the same kitchen equipment). No research. No staff training or learning with time. No ad campaigns or similar to control affluence.

There are some very rough mechanics for a restaurant management game. For example, chairs and tables don't connect to form a single block, so you must leave one layer of free tiles all around the chairs to ensure customers can still pass (seriously?). This is ridiculous and a big lack of gameplay optimisation.

There are also some other major gameplay issues. Your establishment doesn't follow some opening times, your place is always open in an eternal daylight with constantly incoming patrons, to a point where a queue forms outside. If you want to rebuild the restaurant, you have to: close it down, wait for everyone to be served (including people in the queue outside!), wait for them to leave, modify the place, and reopen. This makes no sense. Virtually every single tycoon game manages this better. It would've been way smarter and more interesting to have a building phase at night, a staff/ingredients management phase before opening, and a running phase. Instead, we have this. Trying to modify the restaurant with customers inside, with the ensuing mess, was very frustrating.

Also, no campaign mode and no progression whatsoever. Just 6 plain scenarios and a sandbox that offers limited incentives given that everything is immediately available, so money is your only limiting factors. The most you can do is unlock dishes with money, which in turn unlocks any new ingredent required. But this is not stimulating and once more an underdeveloped feature. There is only a bunch of dishes, and it seems you have to start from fries in every case. For the first two months, I run a place that only served fries because I really had no alternatives. The game offers no real choice to, say, build a coffee shop vs a fast food vs an upscale restaurant. Again, a half-baked product.

I could go on, but you get the idea. If you really have to, buy it with a heavy discount. Or just avoid it altogether. If you're lucky enough to get your hands on that old gem that is Restaurant Empire, you will see what a restaurant tycoon game can really be about. Make yourself a favour and avoid Tastemaker.",0.0

Combat is a little lack luster, but that's ok to me. I vastly prefer exploration and story, but I know this bothers some people.

The first game was charming, but proved quite frustrating to play because of how floaty the platforming could feel despite how demanding the game got. Teslagrad 2 thankfully has none of that. It can still be a challenging game, but moving around, jumping, climbing, zipping, all feels and looks fantastic. 

It also does a thing I love, but not enough metroid-likes do correctly: you get new abilities, but they are not just to open an arbitrary door and then nothing else. All the moves you acquire add to your movement and attack options, making navigating the environment quicker and more enjoyable each time. It's wonderful stuff, and I had a great time zooming around back and forth, finding everything on my own. 

It's not a very long game, I would imagine a normal playthrough will take you about 3-4 hours, and then a few more depending on if you try to find all the scrolls and secrets. I recommend it, as there is a ton of world building and environmental storytelling to discover through this. It took me 8 hours in total and I thoroughly enjoyed my time.

The 100% secret final boss is REALLY tough, but it was very satisfying completing the game. Gorgeous artstyle and wonderful animation, fantastic soundtrack, great world building and wordless narrative. I'm excited to see what the developers will do next in this world, as this is stellar work and an excellent metroid-like well worth playing.

- Great sound design, I love how it feels to get a dunk in and the sound design helps it out a TON
- Music is choice! Thank god for the Nash Sound Library!

- Not much content, which is listed as a con here, but I'm giving some slack since this is a single dev!

Hopefully the dev can add more content to the game soon, like more teams, more courts, hell even some real out there stuff like a Create-A-Team or some online play, or maybe even power ups and cheat codes, however, this is understandable if it can't be achieved.

6463,137081000.0,1621990,"Great game, has more replay value than soulsgames.
If you wanna experience everything, you have to die, mostly due to gravity.
Games enemies are basically simulating an ecosystem, if you clear an area of enemies, and if you die, then those areas mostly will be later on devoid of those enemies or switched out with the other type of enemy, basically fiends vs humans, humans build new stairs, platforms, chests, forges, also sometimes block some pathways, while fiends will destroy said stuff.
You also have some metroidvania stuff too, when you get new powers to get access to old areas.
Speaking of old areas, loads of shortcuts that you can unlock, on the fiend side you grow down vines, and on the human side you open mid sized gates from the other side.

Combat is also okay, mostly the game wants you either to dodge or parry enemy attacks, but you can try to interrupt the enemy, before getting hit yourself. Timing is still essential, just that you can't rely on 1 defensive strategy. You can also disable the color coding for what type of an attack is incoming, but then it just becomes a trial and error mechanic where you have to remember every attack and if you have can dodge it or parry it.
Lock on mechanic is needed here if you want to see the enemies health/stun bar, but it's not needed for doing parries or dodges.
You start out the game with fists, you get a your old rusty sword back which also hints how much time passed after your first cutscene death, you can also find another starting weapon, these two don't have any masteries for them. Later on you'll only find blueprints for weapons and armor, so you have to use the enemy forges to craft yourself new gear. All the weapon that are crafted come with an unlockable passive skill for the character while not using the weapon. Each weapon also has a special attack.
You can also craft rune that act as temporary buffs for the weapon you have in your hand at the moment, or the hand slot (haven't tested yet, if it's weapon bound or slot bound), the buff itself so far doesn't seem time based, but more about how many times it activates.

Nicest part of the game are the finishing animations, which can be done forcefully after stunning an enemy or automatically sometimes when killing an enemy. You also have your backstabs, which are pretty brutal, but seem to be same for all weapons.

Oh and also some weapons come with a shield, and only with those weapons you can block attacks, the rest of them will only do a parry with the block button, though there is a separate parry button.",1.0

Second of all I am not enjoying the axe. Attacking with it feels so weak, the small SHLING sound effect gets drowned out by the 20 other noises at any minute. Hitting back projectiles seems to be a complete gamble if you will just wiff or not. I cannot for the life of me figure out the timing, go too early and get hit, go a little later and get hit, go the exact same time and angle and position, get hit 50% of the time, holding the axe completely still and letting the projectile hit it worked once. Throwing the axe has worked a grand single time for me so far. I know throwing in VR is kinda lame generally, or that the knuckles can be a little over sensitive or slow to release. If the trigger acted as a release and ignored the grip it would work every time. 

My last gripe is the screen flash every time anything happens. I axe an enemy and pick up its drop in the same moment it dies, screen flashes, did I get hurt? who knows. The screen flash was annoying in the pancake version but it is so much worse when its your entire world flashing bright white. I dont know if I can turn this off in settings because I could not access any settings when i was in game(also annoying).

ps if a free quake mod can have finger support, so can this. 

So I have nothing but negatives to say about this game, why do I recommend it?  Well, its fun. Game had me engaged like a lot of VR doesnt. I just hope the dev continues to work on this and polish it into the game it deserves to be.

6481,137080684.0,2281730,"It's a great game port from mobile! Do not let the term ""mobile"" put you off, this is actually a pretty nice game especially when compared to Activision's greedy COD titles. The graphics, even for a mobile game port are not bad either (there are still PC games that have worse graphics being released).

Combat Master is not run by a really greedy company. They do have bundles, but they are all under $10 each and they give you a variety of matching skinned guns, knives, etc (what you see, is what you get). They also have a battle pass, which only cost $5. Keep in mind that this is a free game, so some microtransactions are necessary (devs need to eat lol) but at least they are not expensive and are not gambling mechanics.

The game is pretty small in storage requirements, which makes it perfect for people who have bad internet or low end PCs. Being a game ported from mobile, you may also be able to play this on a older/weaker PC without major issues.

You can play the game both online and offline, and you can also access the stuff you earned/bought offline too. Offline playability ensures that you can still play the game even if the servers shut down (of if your internet is down, or if you're somewhere without internet, ect.), which is great! Offline modes allow you learn the game mechanics, experiment with various loadouts, as well as avoid cheaters and toxic players too. The offline modes also have adjustable difficulty and progression works offline too, so the game is not P2W (new players can play offline until they unlock better gear and are ready to play online) and veteran players can still get a challenge from the bots by cranking up the difficulty.

Additionally, this game has optional crossplay (play with players on a different platform) and shared progression (you can play the game with your account on both PC and mobile). This also means that your purchases on mobile or PC carry over to other platforms! Of course if you want, you could create a separate account on PC or mobile.

6487,137079909.0,1867520,"Jesus where do I start.

I am gonna be pretty critical of everything here despite it being day 1 launch.

The game is not marked as early access, therefore I should expect a good release. This game isn't even serviceable as a fun game, let alone the good part.

The art style is simple and I do like that, a mix of risk of rain 2 and genshin impact type style. But it has a hard time picking. The models themselves have blaring issues that make them overall ugly to look at and the amount of uv mapping errors creating texture stretch or normal map issues are very apparent. The sound engine is. Unity teir, lets leave it at that. (before that triggers someone who swears by unity, I also use unity daily. It's pretty lackluster.) The sounds are just overwhelmingly loud and underwhelmingly quiet. The balancing of the audio is just messy is what I mean.

The animation is. Yeah. It's really, really stiff and lazy since they don't have any sort of tilt or ik systems to it. It all looks hand animated by new developers and very rushed. For instance the walking animation is just the running animation slowed down by however much percentage it takes to line the feet up with the speed. 

Voice acting is nice, I do like that part. Hate the writing. Why does cucklefuck the cat need to treat new players like an expert despite the game not even having a tutorial. They just kind of throw you in and say. ""Ok, now do this!"" They dont even go over basic ui elements like opening the inventory.. (its ""I"" by the way, worst fucking choice. Use b for bags or tab or literally anything that doesn't require me to lift a hand away from the movement controls)

As far as story goes. ""yeah world used to be a bustling place and now this thing is killing it. it died, you have to rebuild"" trope as always.

As for gameplay. Ooooohf, cant jump, cant go over ledges because of invisible walls, terrible, unresponsive ui and buggy pathfinding on cucklefuck. I softlocked when entering the miasma the second time since cuck wanted to run into a wall endlessly and needed a save reload. I do like that you can pick up the plants and inspect them, very polished feeling feature. Maybe its not, it just feels like the only thing they put more time into.

While some other games focus on external systems for getting cards for the main usage of those cards, Arcana instead focuses on very simple cards with an interesting depth of use for individual cards inside and outside of combat. 

Most of time time this results in a puzzle, where certain cards solve a problem presented to you. Don't have a light? Use a Torch, or if you're using magic, Fireball. A lot of cards do this, which is honestly pretty amazing. I think this is one of the more interesting games I've seen that does more with the concept than ""here is a card game you can't play in paper"" and does some really interesting stuff with it.

6509,137084207.0,1698220,"I had played Teslagrad a while ago and really wasn't expecting a followup to that first opus; so I was pretty glad seeing a second one was being released, and quite curious about it,

My fist impressions are that, it doesn't disappoint: the graphical art is a bit similar in some points to the first one, while being a tad more colorful, and I was surprised to see that some elements, as well visual as musical, were reminiscent of Ori and the Blind Forest (the visual resemblance at some point, concerning some nature elements, such as trees, waterfalls as well as some foes, is rather staggering). The music is very beautiful too imo, and corresponds well to the sceneries of a slavic / nordic folklore. So artistically, it's a continuation of the first which doesn't break off too much from it, while presenting a certain evolution.

As for the gameplay, simply said, the controls are easy to learn while hard to master, given the situations you will be put into - I died a lot for the time I started to play the game, but the automatic save points were placed in a *very* fair way, made apparently to not frustrate the player - otherwise, there are many passages and sections that are rather tricky, and if you fail it's only a chance to do it again, to better handle the lightning based character's actions.

....I need to play more of this, have just started it but felt compelled to write a review anyway - it's with no doubt a game which quality stays faithful to the first one's,and once again glad this game came out. Just a tiny bit puzzled this game doesn't have more reviews - but it might be logical, as another metroidvania of the same sort (Rusted Moss) was released just one week before, and Teslagrad 2's release might have been a bit overshadowed by Rusted Moss' one; I hope in any case that Teslagrad 2 meets some good success because it would be frankly deserved. A followup worthy of praise, beautiful.",1.0

The good side first: great art, lovely character, intrigue world-building, and speechless storytelling!

But that's not what make (any) game become a good game. No. Games need ""gameplay"" in order to make it memorable/enjoyable!

And that's what lack from this title.

Admittedly, the core idea of the game that explore ""electromagnetic"" mechanic is charming. Build a platforming world with north/south magnetic field here and there, while let the player to switch on/off their character became a psudo-magnetic object in order to solve the puzzle. Sound fun and challenging and have a lot of potential interesting levels. Implementing it right and the game might join the greatest puzzles of all time club (notable members: Fez, Portal, Baba is You, Patrick's Parabox, etc).

However, this game ruin the opportunity. Even with the second chance.

The magnetic mechanic itself is so clunky! Yes, the physics was implemented realistically, e.g., jumping is projectile. But does the game [i]really[/i] need that realistic aspect, like putting realistic first and player intention later (not to mention that the control is not tight at all)? Combined with the continuously coordination and curved platforming everywhere, now each jump is crucial since a slightly different initial angle/position result in huge different outcome momentum. Which the game take a sadistic path that require you to make perfect jump and maintain correct momentum multiple times in a row.

Furthermore, a room in this game is too large with too less checkpoints. A misjump at the last part of the platforming section will cost you a minute, because now you need to redo everything from start of the room, again.

The annoying platforming is one thing. But boss fights take the frustration to another level.

Basically, you have 1 HP.

Really? In 2023??? When other games in the industry concern about accessibility and have option to subdued these frustration, let player enjoy the game the way they like. (And, maybe, after they beat the game once, they might comeback for the intentional experience later!)

Duck, even Dark Souls allows mistakes!!!

Honestly, whose the target audience of this amazing world-building but punishing gameplay?

6526,137084000.0,2323980,"TL;DR This game is mechanically sound, engaging, and definitely worth the buy.

I'm not much for mobile-style games, so I wasn't already experienced in this type of game. 
I got the demo a few days before release, and I was genuinely impressed by this game even before acquiring the full version.
It takes Bejeweled and does a good job, in my opinion, of ""rogue-liking"" it.

In specific, gameplay requires that you master the manipulation of the board, because every enemy has a different way of being killed,
and builds can be coherent (i.e. have particular strengths and weaknesses depending on your spell loadout and relic quantities).

In general, it has the Slay the Spire-esque magic recipe of relying on experience and memorization, while also requiring on-the-spot thinking, making every run unique.
And there's still a great deal of development potential and refining to be done, so this is an affordable and worthwhile pick for people who pop into early access games and play them whenever they're updated.",1.0

6539,137086621.0,1457080,"Bear in mind, this review is coming from the perspective of a Sylas main, so this game basically had to butcher the personality of the characters in order to lose me. That being said, this game is very fun. The game feels well paced story wise, as I never felt like I needed to take a break or was ""grinding"". 

THE COMBAT
I played this game on the hard difficulty. The gameplay reminded me a lot of HADES, but with less customization, not a roguelike, and the unique twist of stealing magic. It's very fast, with enough mobility that I could totally see somebody beating this game with no damage taken. That being said, the game is very aware of this, and often forces you to use your mobility to survive attacks, either from grappling to far away enemies/landmarks, or spam dashing to escape a chasing projectile. 
I said there was less customization compared to HADES, but really, it's just different. You aren't in a roguelike, so your loadout is exactly what you make it. You can customize up to four spells you have equipped at all times, varying from AOE damage, healing, simple projectiles, or even utility such as invisibility. About mid-way you also get an empowered state, which comes with your choice of an ultimate. There are 6 ultimates, and each of them have atleast SOME advantage over the others. I only ever used 4, but I do feel the other 2 had their purpose, and someone else would probably find a use for them. You can also spend your currency on base increases to defense, health, physical damage, and magic damage, so there is some variance you can put on your playstyle, though I would be surprised if anyone focused on physical damage, given the game's nature. 
The enemies varied from interesting to mildly annoying. There is one enemy that you have to bring to the ground just to hit them, and with my upgrades at the time I had to do this twice in order to bring one down, leading to me just never targeting them first and accepting the damage they cause. There's also a couple of enemies that have weird damage hitboxes, and I still don't know how one of them works. With all of that out of the way, the rest of the enemies were generally intriguing. A lot of the enemies had attack variants that were fun to interact with, such as the early game wind mages buffing allies, and using their magic to kill their allies was just beyond satisfying.

THE STORY
Avoiding spoilers, the story was good. None of the league characters were butchered or ruined really, and a lot of them were actually made much better in my eyes. The original characters were also mostly delightful, with only a couple that I didn't like, but they weren't overbearing by any means, so it wasn't a problem. 
The story also didn't feel meaningless, as, despite being at a previous point in the Runeterra universe compared to now, it added a lot of lore, and one of the revelations was very exciting to me. It does make the warriors cinematic/freljordian raid on demacia feel a little confusing, but it's not like they made it impossible, and I wouldn't be surprised if it made more sense to somebody who is more of a lore buff than I.

THE ART
This game's artwork is phenomenal. I don't think I've seen this beautiful of pixel art in a game PERIOD. Every spell looks cool as hell, and the game's contrasting colors meant that I almost always could tell what was going on in a fight, with the exception of maybe one enemy. The sound design was also impressive, even if they re-used a lot of sounds from league. I am very picky with sound design, and have often left games just because of it being badly done, but this game knocked it out of the park.

CONCLUSION
Overall, I'd give this game a 9/10 for anyone who is interested in Sylas/playing Sylas as a character, a 8/10 for anyone interested in the league universe, and a 6/10 for anyone who just wants an action RPG. The game's biggest drawback is it's length vs price, but I don't regret my money spent whatsoever, since I was enjoying every minute of it. That being said, if you aren't interested in the league universe, and just want it as a beautiful action rpg, then I'd wait for a sale, maybe 30% off or so.",1.0

It has probably the most perfect 90's arcade vibe of anything I have played in years and years, like spot-on.  A 30-minute session of this, and suddenly it's Summer, 1992, and we're killing time pumping quarters into Strike Force at Darien Lake while we wait for the laser light show to start...  The visual and audio theming is spot-on, it's absolutely terrific. Dev, I see how you even added little music-sync'd pauses into the post-level screen dancer's routines, that's absolutely charming.

As far as gameplay, I've spent a few hours jet-packing and leaping around and learning not to bonk my head on things.  I appreciate that so far the levels have been fairly short time-wise, which fits well with my limited gaming time.  The levels are timed, but I can take as long as I like and be as methodical or idiotic as I like.   The terrain destruction/creation, and the ability to issue simple commands to your evacuees add an interesting element to things.  There are even vehicles to drive!

6555,137085674.0,1412310,"As much as it pains me to say, since I think this VN has a lot of heart so far, I cannot recommend this in good faith, at least in its current state.

You see, while the main selling point of this game is the fact that it is about otokonoko, as in, crossdressing men, it really just isn't. The characters are exclusively referred to as ""she"", ""her"", ""girls"", etc., only going ""Haha but they're boys though"" in one single passing line every couple hours to remind you since you'll inevitably forget. This is, 99.9% of of the time, just a hetero maid cafe visual novel about women, which is not what they advertise themselves as.

You might be thinking ""Maybe it's supposed to be about trans girls"", but one look at any of the promotional material will probably dispel that. Even in-game, they use the terms ""crossdresser"", ""otokonoko"", and ""boy"" *just* enough to where it would be pretty uncomfortable if that was the intent.

It kills me, because I was looking forward to this game for over a year. I was really hoping this would be an oasis in the barren wasteland of English otokonoko themed games, but it was just a mirage. I'll probably see it through to the end, and should the devs end up patching this issue, I'd be more than happy to give this the glowing review I wish I could be typing, but as it stands this game is, frankly, not at all what it's selling itself as, and degenerate homosexuals like me, it'll just be a disappointment.",0.0

6569,137086101.0,1608640,"One of the most immediately captivating and extraordinarily slick roguelites I've encountered in some time. The premise is simple: kick down door, mow down enemies, rinse and repeat. And really, what more do you need?

The core gameplay feel is much like Hotline Miami: equal parts tactical planning and twitchy clutch maneuver, plus the occasional spray-and-pray. A time-slowing mechanic present in the game makes pulling off those hairpin strategies a bit easier, but you can pretty much ignore it if you'd rather rely solely on your guns to do the talking. And, speaking of guns, they all feel absolutely FANTASTIC, which great haptic feedback from vibration (I've been playing with a controller). Also notable is that they SOUND incredibly satisfying (no puny Enter the Gungeon pea shooters here), with meaty sound design to enhance the sense of power. This is all backed up by a pulse-pounding soundtrack. Seriously, the music is sick -- you'll get absolutely amped as the beat pulses beneath the hail of gunfire and occasional explosion.

Of course, the roguelite structure means some key changes from the Hotline Miami base. For one, you don't die in a single hit; you have a much more forgiving health bar that refills after clearing each room (more akin to a floor), and you can boost your health and get some sustain through items as well. It's a necessary change to support the run-based (rather than mission-based) formula. And, of course, there are those aforementioned items (called liquors in-game): you start each run with a free item from a randomized choice of three, and every two or so rooms, you'll encounter the shop, where you can buy pretty much as many as you can afford. Needless to say, you can rack up quite a handful of items relatively quickly, and fast, stylish gameplay rewards you with more money via a combo multiplier. It's worth noting that the items themselves are well-designed, too: exploding corpses, reflecting bullets, health leeching attacks, get-out-of-death-free iframes, and more good stuff like that. Roguelite fans who love to accrue a ton of cool passive upgrades (myself included) will be very happy with this dynamic, and, to sweeten the pot, there are plenty of unlockable liquors as well.

In short: you simply must check out this game. Even in my short playtime, I can tell this is something special. Blazing-fast pacing, incredible gunplay, stellar sound design, and meaningful progression make this an incredibly easy game to recommend.",1.0

6602,137089219.0,1941780,"I will begin this review by stating upon the removal of the accidental (fucking hopefully) this review will become a recommend with a few asterisks, but still a very high recommend. Now for the actual review which was sent previously in the suggestions channel of the game discord.

First, incredibly fun game. I really enjoy it. I do however think it has a pretty extreme identity problem. While initially everything seemed to work well, some jank and weirdness I will comment on shortly, I really enjoyed it. But then I died. I expected to be sent back to the main menu, or to a replay screen, or some sort of rogue-light element regarding boosts in between games. To be honest I thought the game was a rogue like. However, to my surprise, I spawned back in! This came as a shock, but I kept playing, and it all just felt empty. 

The limited world generation has been commented on previously, however the fact that when you die you have to  go through all of it a second, and even third time, makes the situation even worse. I knew what the, admittedly limited, buildings were like already, and so any reason to return to any of them instead of either running  straight to a marked point or to my death locale is removed by that fact. That then leads to two other issues I have with the game currently: first, that the marking of locations of useful items on the map is not a great system just at a foundational level (I can try to explain this is you'd like however I feel it is kinda self explanatory. Chore list instead of exploration kinda vibes) and second, the stamina system. As I've only played about three hours of the game this night at this point I may be missing what previous versions of the stamina system looked like, however as it is right now the stamina system, while it works perfectly in combat (IMO), only slows down the entire game outside of combat.

I think it's worth going into the stamina bar a bit more as, considering the design choices you've made with the bosses, the dodge roll, and everything else, you are going for a dark souls type vibe. This is wonderful and makes me super excited to see what the boss battles look like in the future! However, let's take a look at these games you're (this is an assumption so correct me if I'm wrong) referencing. Elden Ring, incredible system for physical combat, but when traversing the map you can ride Torrent! Dark Souls III/Sekiro, the campfire/sculptor systems act as portals across the large worlds. Now, obviously, that sort of fast travel would go against the entire ethos of this game, however I bring them up because each example is showing a way to differentiate out of combat, and in combat, movement. And currently, the out of combat movement options are extremely limited. What doesn't help this is the fact that stamina is used extremely fast while running, and the only way, to my current understanding, to recharge it is soda or water which if you run out of, you're basically just done!

So, combining the lack of engaging aspects to stamina, and the multiple lives. Taking into account the (current) lack of interesting locations, and the (assumed) goal for a repeatable game loop. I believe that the multi-life aspect is currently very negative for the game. Every time you respawn you are either running from marked '?' to marked '?' hoping you get a strong enough weapon to just grab your old gear, and on the way if you don't pick up enough soda or water you're just fucked! So, you replay from your Home to wherever you died, possibly on the other side of the island, running through already picked and labyrinthian houses. To be honest, at this point, I just start a new world each time I die. I of course have neglected to mention the respawning of loot till now, however I feel if anything it's requirement as a system is only a symptom of the respawn system. I don't believe it actually adds anything to the game's experience.

This is all not to say that the almost arcade-like approach cannot work or be fun. It's just the current build of the game does not support it. Maybe you add a hardcore mode in the future making the whole above section optional. Maybe (and hopefully) the world is continually added to and expanded, adding more interesting things to explore on the way, the houses more clearly built, zombies more interesting to fight, and likely more stuff you have planned I don't even know about! This also applies to stamina, I'm sure all the numbers are currently subject to change and maybe something like natural stamina regen will be added in the future. However I think currently the fact you don't restart after each death is highly damaging to the entire game loop and honestly enjoyment killing for me at least (note again, I've just been restarting fresh after each death).

Okay, I think that's all I can say when it comes to the respawn factor. Now, other stuff:
**The zombies** overall are fine, nothing bad nothing great, hitboxes can be kinda weird in CQC but I'd assume that's on purpose for melee to be needed (which while we're on the topic I feel melee could use a bit of a damage buff, but maybe I'm not actually hitting my attacks).

**The bosses** are fine, the ones I've currently beaten (the cop and the queen) are both wonderful! The main issue is just the fact that both of them (in initial stages especially) rely super heavily on movement, which is a great thing, if only the movement wasn't so buggy they got caught on each and every little corner. The Queen gets stuck easily in the stairwell for instance, and I don't think I even need to give examples for the cop.

**The guns** are all wonderful, I love using them all. I think the variety is fine and the ammo spread is good too. If I could critique here I would just comment on spawning again. The '?' ping system is bad. Maybe have more recognizable spawning locations like in gun lockers or something, just don't mark them on the map. Again, something that could be fixed by removing respawns. Ammo wise I think the rates are all a bit low rn (or maybe I'm just unlucky). There's been a couple runs now where I just kept searching for ammo, but would end up just running to question marks to unload the guns there for 
measly handfuls of ammo (which was admittedly pretty fun, just not for long)

**The world** is a work in progress. I like the ideas behind it all, I just have one comment. When using imagery to bring across topics such as fascism, while fictional or made up characters or people are fine, using a picture of a nazi officer taken straight off of google is not a great idea. Especially when there is (currently) no real method to my knowledge of learning the plot you are trying to put across. I get what you're going for, but that's just not the way. If anything lean more into the already created police station building, expand police imagery, add some more proper fasho-1984-police combinations. Now that would be unique in the world of video games we exist in. (Just to expand on this point, I did not recognize the picture, multiple people on the steam community page did and then uninstalled the game. I see the use of this  imagery negatively, however ignoring my perspective this is actively harming the player-base)

**Multiplayer** god I'm sure it's gonna be so fun when it's easier to play with my friends. Very excited.
**Graphics** fine, nothing to write home about.
**Sound** Guns all sound great, otherwise no comments.

I think I got all my ideas out there, I want to finish by stating that again I recognize that this is an alpha build. Obviously everything is subject to change, I just hope my suggestions may assist in making you (especially you as an individual developer) have to make less changes total to reach a quality product. I really really really enjoy the game already, and I hope that's evident because I just spent over an hour writing an extremely long discord ""essay"" on my suggestions and thoughts.",0.0

6608,137088736.0,1537830,"This game has really good moment to moment gameplay. Mechanics like charging powerups, dash slamming enemies, grinding on rails, and using unique character abilities is fun, and the game very much feels like a combat racer. And, the music in the levels ranges from okay to amazing. BUT, the monetization in this game is complete and total garbage. The game has basically a billion different upgrade currencies, racers have levels that effect their stats, racers are unlocked through a shard system, with you also needing to collect more shards to increase a character's power and rarity (the base version of every character doesn't even have their unique ability), and the game has loot boxes (which I thought we have gotten past as a medium but apparently not). The later sections of the starter circuits in the game don't even give you the character that you need to start them, you just have to hope that you'll get enough shards for the necessary character through loot boxes. On top of that, levels and rarity levels can be important, and competitive races can be dominated by people with high level, high rarity characters (ranked also has a meta, as Mike Wazowski is way overpowered, which is a sentence I never thought I'd write). The game does have a 'regulated' ranked mode where all racers have the same level, but the rewards for that mode are heavily limited. If you want to unlock anything, you have to play in a basically pay to win ranked mode. What's even funnier and dumber is that in the game's current 'early access' (or just normal release for suckers like me who paid) you can't even spend money so your progression is just arbitrarily locked. This game can be really fun, but in its current state it feels like a parody of every crappy free-to-play system designed to annoy people into spending money. And if the developers don't fix that, I don't think this game has a future, which is sad, because again, I really do like some things about this game.",0.0

6624,137089715.0,1412310,"If I had to title this review, I would call it ""Too Bad Playing Through The First Route Took Me More Than 2 Hours So I Couldn't Get A Refund.""

I agree with the other negative review that talks about this not feeling like the type of game it is advertised as - this feels like playing a heterosexual visual novel through and through. There's barely any of the ""Girls!?"" part in this game, it almost never comes up that these are boys cross-dressing in a maid cafe - they're always referred to as ""she"" and ""girls"" and by the end I was just bored, waiting for anything interesting to happen. Not to mention, the fact that this game is already so expensive and any ""exciting"" (adult) parts are gated behind an off-site paywall is ridiculous. 
It took me 3 hours to play one route - and that's me taking it slow, saving at the seemingly-important questions because I am a save-scummer in these type of games, going back to see what the other options were, hoping that I was maybe just missing the interesting options the first time around and I'd eventually find something worth continuing to play this game for - and I got more bored and more disappointed the longer I played.
And what's more - the ""girls"" barely have personalities to speak of, all whiny/abrasive and not very endearing, and the character you play as is pretty pathetic. (Not that that's especially rare in these types of games, I know no one plays these games for the MC, but it just makes for a more annoying experience on top of everything else). The plot is also VERY melodramatic, maybe if I cared about any of the characters I would care about what happened to them, but again, I really did not expect to sit down with this game and get nagged about the complexities of keeping a cafe open, I just wanted to have fun and see cute guys in cute outfits... like was advertised in all the marketing.
I realize maybe I over-hyped this game in my mind, but with so little of these types of games to choose from, so much advertising from the developer, and such a long time of seeing it sitting on my Wish List and looking forward to it, I can't help but feel let down by the final product. And I feel like I'm pretty lenient with my judgement because I WANT more games like this to exist - just fun, silly, lascivious romps for people who like cute guys to sit down and enjoy for a few hours. But at this price point, for what you get v.s. what is advertised, I say save your money. Or if you really just like to look at characters in maid outfits and pretend they're boys even though every line of dialogue in the game practically tells you otherwise, then go for it.",0.0

The Good:
- Absolutely amazing artwork, the before level screens honestly the vibes of this game are tremendous.
-Storytelling is really good, has gigantic 80's vibes.  Definitely think the openers on levels are very fun.
-Gameplay loop is satisfying, if you like mowing down hordes of people you'll be right at home here.
-Character design is awesome, I love my clown wife,
-Enemy design, is that a murder toaster, hell yeah brother.  Really cool stuff going on here, I don't want to spoil much but you won't be let down in this department.

The Eh:
- Sometimes I felt directionless, the maze level which to the games credit I didn't finish felt repetitive I think some sort of identifier to help feel like you're progressing.  Versus something like the city levels which feel like you're making progress.
-I'd like to have a retry button on the game over screen.  As cool as the story parts are it's definitely time consuming when you're trying to get used to a level even with skipping.

The combat moves from most enemies are hard to see the telegraphs and it makes it more frustrating than your average souls game is.  A lot of them will use the same start to an animation and then switch it up at the last second to do a delayed move thus causing a missed parry.  It becomes really frustrating instead of fun.  Take this with a grain of salt because my reflexes are slowing as I age so this could just be me needing to git gud.  One of the first hard enemies killed me like 30 times.  It was ""harder"" than elden ring or even sekiro.

Beyond some of my frustration with the combat moves I like the game a lot.  The story is good so far, the environments are cool.  Despite my earlier comments on combat I actually still enjoy the fighting, it can just be frustrating sometimes.  The game is performing great, no issues, but I have a really good cpu and gpu.

Really enjoying the game so far.  Definitely worth the $30 price tag.",1.0

If you've enjoyed things such as Iron Lung, and other games that give you that looming feeling that something is following you, you'll love this one. The atmosphere is great, and along with the early PS1 style graphics, it makes for more second guessing if you actually saw something or if your eyes are playing tricks on you. 
Even without constant in your face scares, this game creates such a tense environment (I found myself stalling a few times because I was afraid to turn the camera or go down a cave passage).

I always admire a really put together story with horror games, as you can get more immersed and feel things closer to home- and this story did just that even coupled with the unnerving out there aspects of the story. Some games leave you on too much of a cliff hanger and don't really provide enough information for you to piece together theories, but this one allows for so much theory-crafting! (Lore nerds, you'll enjoy this one!)

Mechanics and sound made everything so much more eerie, there is something about dated technology that just adds to the horror element all together!

Ingredients:

6 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/2 cup white sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup water

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 pinch salt

5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1.0

Great game with nearly infinite replayability from what I can see.",1.0
6675,137092778.0,1457080,"Game has a lot of good qualities. I've played through all the game has to offer and there are many parts I do enjoy. It has good music, lore, Some parts of the combat feel pretty fluid and fun(other parts don't). Enemies are just diverse enough to keep the game from becoming monotonous and boring. 

Unfortunately this game has a good number of flaws. I don't blame Digital Sun for the narrative issues, as riot didn't give them the easiest of characters to craft into a hero. But there are several interfaces and interactions that are quite clunky(see below) not to mention a ton of bugs from making enemies un-targetable, to you yourself freezing in place. The only fix I've found for these bugs is quitting and reloading, and when that happens 4+ times in your session it gets pretty frustrating. Combine all this with the fact that some of the game's spells are locked behind paid DLC when $30 is already asking a lot for this product imo, and you get a game I just can't in good faith recommend to everyone

Your character's dash becomes pretty frustrating in combat. If the developers didn't want you to go through terrain with this dash that's their choice(perhaps Hades is just spoiling me) but instead if there is any terrain in your dashing direction it catches you and holds you in place instead of at least nudging you around it. You have to be very careful in combat as often times this dash of yours can hurt you as much as the enemies you are facing

Also the button for dash is the same button as skip dialogue, if you dash into a cut-scene trigger point you will automatically skip dialogue, so change that button config as soon as you can if you care about the story.

There was definitely a lot of care and love put into this game but in its current condition I would say either wait for a patch to rough out the kinks and make your experience more enjoyable, or if you can catch it on sale for at least 15%-20% off. Feels a lot like Riot might have rushed this one out before it was completely ready, which is sad, and I hope this trend doesn't continue with the other indie games riot is funding.",0.0

6682,137090078.0,1928870,"As a guy who grew up playing Starcraft 1 & 2, this isn't the best RTS out there but it's trying... sorta

This game has its issues, like I feel like the campaign could use a little more variety in some things like random events of some sort to spice it up other then, Siege a base and Defend a village.

The unit variety is fine but could use some more stuff like maybe they could bring in the Iron Golem for some sort of Heavy Infantry like unit or add the spiders. Small thing but it can be better.

I wish the player character had more upgrades for them specifically, like your gonna be in the heat of battle most of the time so why not add an unlock-able ranged attack option or the ability to repair buildings with an upgrade. small things to let the player interact with their base and world more ya know? of course I understand that some of those mechanics might get delegated to campaign only but hey, can make campaign more interesting atleast.

Multiplayer has some Desync issues here and there but its not the worst and happens rarely for me.

I do see the problem and dislike for the Cosmetic store and I do agree its not a great thing but in the long term its not the worst thing here, its all optional cosmetics and can be ignored if you wish.

The worse thing with the game imo is the fact the game has too little content for it to be worth 40$. The campaign is not super long and pretty repetitive. I feel like they ride on the fact its a randomly generated world on each new save a bit much, while that adds some replayability, its not a great value with the campaign in its current state.

As for the PvP, I haven't done that yet so I wont leave an opinion here as it wouldn't be right.

But despite its problems, its still pretty damn fun for me as a casual. Its far from perfect but the Campaign being co-op is really fun and I enjoy coordinating sieges with my friends.

Though are if you want to buy it, wait until its on sale imo. 15-20$ I feel is what its proper price should be with its current content. Overtime I'm sure they will add more things but if those are required to make the game feel worth the 40$, the game shoulda been delayed a bit.



Overall not the worst RTS game but not the best either, kinda middle of the road and I feel the current Mixed Ratings is correct.

Oh and the game is cross platform so there is that, def was a selling point for me since I have some friends who only have PC and others that only of an Xbox, PS, or a Switch. So this was added to the small pile of games where my friend group can all hang out together.

6692,137091824.0,1816950,"An absolute brilliant sequel to the original, that continues directly from it and repeats what the original game did well and thus gives more of it in return.

It's still just as fun as ever and has great dark humour, voice acting (which was a pleasant surprise) and thus plenty new characters to interact with, a LOT of creativity and great scenarios, but also more abuse of ""logic"" or ""suspension of disbelief"" but who cares when something is this much fun and such a unique experience?

I just discovered the predecessor to this wonderful sequel is 4 years old at least and honestly, I would love to see more sequels to this series now! Even if it takes another 4 years! I had my eye on the original and finally tried on a whim and really enjoyed it, feeling very satisfied with the whole experience after completing it too and thus shown in my review of it too.

I really like the new scenarios in this one, you get some absolutely devilish setups and ""toys"" to play with. It's still quite a cerebral experience but not stupidly difficult or so. It's still very meticulous to the final level especially but its so well crafted, so lovingly designed, that it just feels a solid part of the experience and not frustrating or tedious at all.

I enjoyed the levels from this one even more than the original and there were some very fun and funny outcomes too. There's also a lot more achievements to get this time round, a LOT more than I expected and if replaying missions didn't reset your progress in them (you lose your 100% completion for them if you replay them), I would be more keen to try to get the rest of the achievements too.

This series kinda feels like Hitman as a puzzle game (I don't mean Hitman Go but that kinda fits too) and it's such a unique and surprisingly fun experience. It does make you think and you have to be so utterly careful/precise but the game is very forgiving and even if you complete a level and you leave some evidence behind (even just like an open cabinet door), the game will tell you what you missed and let you continue the level from where the issue was and be able to get your 100% clean result, much quicker and more easier too. I believe the original game does this too, which is just a great choice by the developers and makes the game much better for it too.

This is absolutely worth the money anyway, fantastic value for money and I would GLADLY by more of these games and keep supporting these devs, as this is such an all round enjoyable and satisfying game and product, just like the original, that I am truly EAGER to see more of the same by them too!

6697,137091108.0,2366530,"This is a great wargame! I already enjoyed their previous title, Red Storm, so I was happy to see improvements such as multi-monitor support, colour/contrast adjustments, more tables, detailed intel notes, and everything else I needed to feel like the commander of NATO or Warsaw Pact force. I’d love it if they could integrate the old title into this version!

Already I’ve played two scenarios, ‘Steel Rain’ and ‘Crossing the Waldnaab’, both of which I managed slight victories. The former was more conventional to what I’m used to in ‘what if’ WW3 battles: Stemming the overwhelming onslaught of fast moving Soviet tanks with just a handful of M1A1s, enough tools to find good cover, concealment, and LOS, then corking their advance. Top it off with M109A2s dropping artillery on their heads.

But the second scenario was quite different! I defended a key road/rail network hub against a quick Czech attack using equally fast moving West German recon troops. Though I was outnumbered, I knew if I could conceal them well, and stall them just long enough, an attack chopper & a few Leopards would arrive from Reserve and turn the tide. And they did! Very satisfying to set it up and execute.

This is an asymmetrical turn-based wargame that relies heavily on how orders are given from an HQ, received by their subunits, and the time it takes for information to pass between them. Once commands are issued, the player watches the gameplay progress without the ability to interrupt those actions (just a pause function) until the turn is over. New turns happen after a changeable amount of minutes based on real world factors (e.g quality of communications, experience, jamming) to give new orders or adjust existing ones.

If you’ve enjoyed games like Steel Panthers, Strategic Command, Combat Mission, and Armored Brigade, then this will feel familiar. But if you’re more into World in Conflict, Wargame, or anything remotely RTS, know that Southern Storm is deep-dive simulation with a deliberate pace and loads of ‘under the hood’ details.

So far I love it! It’s not the kind of game that probably does well on Steam, but I hope a few more cold war nerds give it a try. The only negative I have right now are performance related. Turning on any of the terrain tools, or using them in addition to moving a unit, nearly crashes the client from a system hang. I don’t know if it’s a rendering or cpu crunch, but it happens when looking at the %cover, %mobility, elevation kind of layers.",1.0

but if you are like me, you can delve into it alone for a slower and creepier game style!

Objectives are simple but completin' 'em may prove to be a challenge.
The island is not only big, but the game is randomized and you, of course, are not alone! (even if playin' co-op)

And the best part is the Lovecraft element, so there's a lot of Lovecraft for any fan to enjoy!
It's an Amazin' adventure thus far!

6703,137092627.0,2321210,"I emailed the developer and asked for a game key to showcase the game on my Twitch channel that barely exists. I was going to buy this game anyway, but I got a reply a few minutes later. As such, I gifted this title to a friend who I thought would enjoy it. This in no way effects my review or opinion of the game.

This game is a joy to play.

Fluid, precise movement and tight combat alone sells this game. The dodge mechanic is particularly awesome. First of all, it is an i-frame. Second, the enemy tells are actually good, you can see what's happening. Third, and my personal favorite, if you dodge JUST before getting hit, you do a really cool counter attack. It's a dodge and a riposte of sorts at the same time. It's fantastic.

The story is cute. I think that while some of the translations are a bit off and the voice acting isn't Hollywood quality it somehow fits into the world the game tries to create and a has charm to it. Speaking of, there are many unlocks, and some of these include gifting other characters items found during the run. This unlocks boons to equip at the start of a run. Many other unlocks exist, but because of the tight combat you may not need to max everything before you win a run. I haven't done so yet, by the way.

There is a rhythm mechanic in the game, but it is not a huge one, so don't let this deter you. Basically, every fourth beat, you can do your heavy attack. If you get it right, it does an extension of what it would otherwise do. The beat is consistent enough to time (I'm not superb at rhythm games and I can get it), but there's a small bar next to the attack in the bottom of the screen UI that fills up, indicating the beats and the timing. While this may seem out of place, with the timed parry riposte, the tight platforming, and the good enemy tells, it actually fits in quite well. The game's combat is not souls-like, but it is also not a mash fest. It's a delicate balance that let me relax enough to enjoy myself, but stay alert enough to satisfy the craving of a challenge. 

The rooms themselves don't offer exploration (a big positive for me, I'm tired of huge areas to explore, personally), it's just light platforming and the great combat that I mentioned. This game succeeds in just about everything it tries, in my opinion. If you go in with a mindset of playing a fun game, you'll find that here.",1.0

6726,137090778.0,1860510,"I was recently banned from my gym for breaking a door (i am on tren)
The mistake was not understanding my limit. I think we all can make that mistake sometimes.
Well after being placed on house arrest for ironically resisting arrest, i had a fair amount of time on my hands to look for a new game to consume my time with. And being that i recently won a lawsuit in Dayton, Ohio over a broken elevator door (i punched the buttons) i also was left with .. lets say ... a large sum of money.

Well needless to say, i invested in this game, unlike my failed marriage that led me to using tren everyday and raging out over how she not only left me but made jokes about how small my arms were. ""baby arms"" she called me. And unlike the woman who destroyed my life, i actually enjoy this game and lifting weight all day everyday.

My first experience in this game was JUST like using tren. No one was holding my hand, no one injected it for me, no one said i paid too much which i found out later i did but i also got extremely buff so it's fine, muscles are worth that much. How much? Lets just say i no longer have any of that lawsuit money and im currently working.. well i was working at the gym.

Anyway, the game is basically perfect. You've ever been to the gym and pressed the bar so hard that it ripped skin off your hand, this is basically like that. It hurts but it's worth it.




also the devs update this game like they're in the gym using tren right now, lifting

6729,137092741.0,1999940,"Indulge me, dear reader, as I regale you with the most unforgettable and breathtaking experience that I recently had with the latest addition to the Steam gaming realm, Hyperhell. This game is not your ordinary shooter rogue-like game, it is a mesmerizing, heart-pumping journey into an otherworldly, neon-hued abyss that left me speechless.

Let us begin with the music, oh the music! The pulsating beats of hyperpop artists Fraxiom and Gupi, have been masterfully woven into the very fabric of this game. The combination of music and gameplay is nothing short of a symphony, for it results in a thrilling adventure that transcends the boundaries of mere mortals.

The gameplay is exceptional. Hyperhell's intensity is not for the faint of heart; it necessitates precision and lightning-fast reactions. The experience, however, is nothing short of heavenly. (once you've mastered the controls). Each level is an artful creation,  with challenging enemies, mind-bending obstacles (cobwebs), and power-ups galore, keeping you on the edge of your seat.

Yet, what truly sets Hyperhell apart from the rest is its unparalleled art direction. The vibrant, neon-infused visuals are a feast for the eyes. The menacing enemies, pulsating backgrounds, and the fine attention to detail in every element of this game are truly a sight to behold

In conclusion, dear reader, I must confess that Hyperhell is a game that defies classification. It is an artful masterpiece, expertly crafted and executed with precision and care. Its electrifying music from the ""best artists in the entire world"" (~Anthony Fantano), heart-pumping gameplay, and magnificent visuals make it a game deserving of everyone's time and attention. Do not hesitate, for Hyperhell is a rare gem that you cannot afford to miss!

Regarding the multiplayer experience, pvp seems to be the only draw gameplay loop wise. However, in that aspect players will realise the limited amount of units and structures don't really make the game very diverse. Players will run the bare minimum and still succeed in their siege. (Stone golems just eat through defences if you arent bothered with going with anything else that requires more resources)

Overall, the game's campaign opens up some lore elements which is cool if you're a fan of the series. However, if you are here for the siege and RTS aspects, the game has quite a large shoe to fill on that front. I do hope the game adds much more content, maybe making non-hostile mobs more viable and interesting. I understand that some mobs are likely not going to be implemented due to lore and what's canon.

I found something that truly enraptured me...and have it on my screen ever since I bought it.

Factory Town Idle is a LOT like Kitten's Game and I played that game to death... you start of as any clicker... click a bush to get some wood, use the wood to build a house, assign the worker you get from that house to farm the wood for you, build more houses...

But like Kitten's game the game slowly expands and puts layers upon layers upon more layers of game mechanics. That wood can be made into paper to do research with... or plaks to build more advanced buildings, maybe traded to another village to get them started, sold to the market for money, burned to made coal.... and that's just a snippet for wood (which is maybe 1 of some 30 resources you need to manage)

Factory Town Idle has that distinct honor of turning from an engaging clicker game, into an idler, into a resource management game.... only to have a townspecific upgrade, improvement and even prestige system to be layered on top of that.

If you're a fan of idlers or resource management games then pay this dev some cash... for it's current listing the game is theft with YOU being the thief....

The game is undoubtedly fun and very well polished, but there's no excuse for the horrific gacha mechanics. Perhaps this will be less atrocious when the game [i]actually[/i] becomes free-to-play, whenever that is.

But for the time being, you need to pay [i]at least[/i] $30 (non-refundable, as well) in order to get into the game so you then can deal with the frustrating gacha mechanics so that you can...not unlock things, because practically everything requires shards to unlock, shards which are only acquired through gacha mechanics, so if you find yourself lucky enough to get a really rare item, suffer from the knowledge that you'll need to get the exact same really rare item [i]at least[/i] four more times.

Oh, and let's not forget that characters can be upgraded to give you an advantage in a race. Nothing quite like paywalling stats in a kart racer.

You can view my initial impressions review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/JjCIwFCk2Og

[u]This is a neutral recommendation.[/u] I think the puzzle game is fine if you're interested in this game type for VR. However, I don't think VR brings anything special to these types of puzzle games. You're basically playing minesweeper, connect the line, soduku, & other pen & paper puzzle type games in VR. 

The other issue is that there are only 8 puzzle types and 64 puzzles in total. Assuming you're smart, you can probably blow through the content in 1 hour or much longer if you have a lizard brain. Interactions work fine most of the time, but sometimes I had difficulties selecting the items.

It's fine for what it is. You get to manipulate 3D objects in mostly a 2D way. It's like playing hangman in VR though .. you can do it & the game is enjoyable, but what do the simple 3D visuals really bring to the experience that would be better than just pen & paper or a free flash game on a brower? I don't know, but I could see some people enjoying this in VR more than in 2D since you do get to interact with 3D objects.

[b]Rate 5/10. If you ever wanted to play these types of games in VR ... it's only $4 USD. However, I think there may be free versions of these type of games on like VRChat or Rec Room if you look hard enough. [/b]

6806,137099745.0,1537830,"Disney Speedstorm and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe are both popular racing games that have captured the hearts of gamers around the world. While both games share similar elements of fun, fast-paced racing and colorful graphics, they have some distinct differences that set them apart.

One of the most significant differences between the two games is their character selection. In Disney Speedstorm, players can choose from a variety of Disney characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Elsa, and Buzz Lightyear, each with their unique abilities. In contrast, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe features a range of characters from the Mario franchise, each with different stats and abilities. This difference makes Disney Speedstorm more appealing to Disney fans and children, while Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is more geared towards gamers who grew up playing the classic Mario games.

Another notable difference is the track design. Disney Speedstorm's tracks are inspired by Disney's theme parks, such as Space Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean, while Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's tracks are inspired by the Mario universe, featuring familiar locations like Bowser's Castle and Rainbow Road. Disney Speedstorm's tracks are more visually appealing, with more detail and a more significant emphasis on theme park theming, while Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's tracks are more focused on gameplay mechanics, with elements like jumps, boosts, and obstacles.

Both games have a range of power-ups and weapons that players can use to gain an advantage during the race. However, the power-ups in Disney Speedstorm are more diverse and imaginative, such as fireworks that can blind opponents or honey that slows them down. In contrast, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's power-ups are more traditional and simpler, such as banana peels and green shells.

In conclusion, both Disney Speedstorm and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe are excellent racing games that offer hours of fun and excitement. Disney Speedstorm is more appealing to Disney fans and children, with its unique character selection and visually stunning track designs. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, on the other hand, is more geared towards gamers who grew up with the classic Mario games, with its familiar characters and traditional power-ups. Ultimately, the choice between the two games depends on personal preference and the audience's age range.",1.0

6815,137097935.0,1457080,"[h1] Intro [/h1]
First of all, some bias towards this game as I have and still play League of Legends, but you do not need to play League to enjoy this one. There are just some minor details/references you'll recognize if you do play it.

I played on Kingslayer difficulty while on default Sylas health and damage.

Overall, I enjoyed playing this game. The story was well written, the main cast were very likable, the combat was pretty satisfying to say the least and the spell system was really fun to use. 

The bosses tho? They're on a WHOLE NOTHER LEVEL. The league champions used in their fights are VERY faithful to their in-game counterpart, and the Mageseeker original bosses were really unique in their own fights.
[h1] Non-positives [/h1]
Although the game is not perfect. There are a bunch of flaws that affect the game. The biggest offender in my opinion is the lack of a fast forward option, ESPECIALLY BEFORE BOSSES. Because when you die at a boss, you have to rewatch the cutscene [b]KH1 style[/b]. And there is an option to ""fast forward it"" but it only skims through the dialogue and maybe (?) speeds up the cutscene by a tiny bit. Also the element enhancing melee spells are not that good. (except occult shield)
[h1]The combat and spell system[/h1]
Every enemy can be magically categorized into one of 7 types, from Magicless, Fire, Ice, Wind, Nature, Lightning, Mystic and one more exclusive magic exclusive to certain bosses in the game [spoiler] Garen and Wisteria (Morgana's magic cannot be stolen as it gives her a shield when attempted)[/spoiler]. 
Each element has a weakness to it's respected opposite. ex: fire is weak to ice and ice is weak to fire and etc.
To actually use a spell in battle you must steal it from an enemy first in a level. Then after the level you can talk to one of the members to purchase the spell to use mana to cast it. If you stole a spell from an enemy, it is a one use cast and there is a timer for when you can steal it again. 

[h1]Sylas's Combat[/h1]
Sylas has 2 different types of combos. Light attacks and Heavy attacks. In succession, Sylas can do a light attack up to four times, ex: L L L L  | or heavy attack up to three times. ex: H H H. Light attacks are fast and Heavy attacks do more damage, have longer range, are slower and can damage armor. Dash attacks are there too i guess. You can also switch between light and heavy attacks creating combos like H H L H where normally the heavy finisher appears on the third hit but adding a light extends the combo so you can do a heavy attack afterwards.
An important thing to mention is the chain grab. After targeting an enemy and hitting RB/R1 you can pull yourself into an enemy. You are fully invincible while travelling to them, but not after that, and also good for another mechanic i just discovered.

[h1] Finish Cancelling[/h1]
After using either your 4th light attack or 3rd/4th heavy attack (based on example above) you will do a ""finisher"" where that last hit will deal the most damage but leave you not able to move for a tiny bit. Your moves can be cancelled into a dash but not after using a finisher. This is where the chain grab comes in. if you grab someone after your finisher, it will pull you to them cancelling the time you were left open to do more combos. 

[h1] Bosses [/h1]
The bosses in this game have their own gimmick to them and they test your skills to see if you got what it takes to conquer them and triumph! Though a couple of bosses that spike in difficulty exist, they are so satisfying when you finally beat them. 

[h1] Is this game worth full price? [/h1]
Nah not really, I don't really feel like the game is worth it's full price cause I feel like I spent too much despite the praise i give this game. I recommend you get it on a sale.

[h1] Additional thoughts [/h1]
I've seen a bunch of people complain that since the game was too short (around 10 hours long) which makes me believe people think that longer games should be worth more (?) which I believe is wrong. I believe that there are more to that like how the story depicted the characters or the experience through your journey playing, or maybe it's just my deluded self thinking that because a lot of people around my age range play just the online multiplayer games.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
In all, the game was super enjoyable to play and it was a blast the whole way through, but you should wait for a sale... or dont, your choice.

6816,137099065.0,1928870,"I personally think its a good game, although the price is a little bit high, but i am glad the Xbox and Mojang are willing to try new genre with this classic IP instead of let it rot, we should encouraging the company like Xbox and developer like Mojang to try the new stuff and new game type and new future for the IP, they could just sit there and watch the money flow into their pocket just by original Minecraft, but they are willing to expand the IP and actually make a couple decent game, so i am exciting to see how this game would go in the future.

but i sill need to said about the cons of this game 
1. the control of command system: personally i thought it will be like Mount and blade kind of control type, but no, the control for command are odd and unpleasant, you have to keep rally your troops instead and constant giving order, because when they done your order they would just stand there, i wish they sill come and regroup with me, and the AI for the minion are awful, when you order charge some time they would ignore the enemy troops and charge straight to the flag and only attack when they arrive at the flag point, i wish they could make some change and improve
2. the building system : once your defense building was destroy, you have to rebild by yourself, maybe just pay some resource and they can rebuild automatically to original design.
3. need more content and mission variety 
4. more RPG element: gear, skill, perk and weapon etc.

overall i think its a good game after all, if you still consider to get it or not, maybe wait for now to see how this game goes or maybe on sale",1.0

6844,137101650.0,1537830,"In sum, Speedstorm is an extremely fun racing Kart game with a Disney theme on top of it that will be really interesting to see further developed and embracing more players when it becomes Free to Play (late 2023/early 2024). 
The game has a really strong foundation in all aspects, so I'm looking forward for the upcoming new content updates, plus hope to see quick action on balance fixes to keep on top of player metas. Also wish to see players and gaming community concerns directly addressed when it pertains to attenuate parts of the monetization; the game can really flourish if this aspect is simplified and the focus is put on more avenues for the player to acquire even more unique visual cosmetics such as unique Karts and Character Skins.


[b]  More intricate details about the game in general:[/b] 
The vehicles handling, speed and the controller feel are great with a myriad of racers present all with different character specific skills plus the power-ups that you can get during the race that make every single race really frenetic and dynamic. Specially considering the good quantity of tracks and variations of them, which contain diverse paths that will be beneficial to each different racer type (Speedster, Trickster, Brawler, Defender).
The game also has a lot of Single-player content and two different Multiplayer Modes (Ranked with levels and Regulated where everyone is at the same level) great graphics that represent well all characters from the different IPs along with the themed tracks from each IP, plus a killer OST containing remixes from the most iconic tunes and movie songs that will definitely stay with you after the game session ends.

The only big caveat of the game as mentioned above, it's the way that you progress and acquire new characters which is tied to a gaccha system akin to other games that contains these type of monetization mechanics (e.g. Genshin Impact), turning into an over complicated experience to acquire characters and over extend the required time for acquisition versus having more ways to get them directly, plus bringing progression levels that not only tie to the Single layer related modes but also one Multiplayer Ranked mode. 
Although to note that all character currently feel competitive (some just requiring a slight change or nerf such as Mike and others a buff such as Beast) so in that sense it's not a major concern to aim for whichever character you like the most in terms of IP or their unique skill along with having a dedicated Multiplayer component (Regulated Multiplayer) in which everyone has the same character level so that players are not forced to worry and dive into the levelling system for online play (which is great fun since it always allows you to invite friends from all levels to join your race).

[b]  The current character roster is the following:[/b] 
■ The classic Disney Trio: Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy plus Steamboat Mickey (next season)
■ Beauty and the Beast: Belle and Beast
■ Hercules: Hercules and Meg
■ The Jungle Book: Mowgli and Baloo
■ Monsters, Inc: Sulley, Mike Wazowski, Randall, Celia Mae
■ Mulan: Mulan and Shang
■ Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann
■ Walt Disney World: Figment
■ Possibly coming soon since the tracks were already teased: Toy Story and Lilo & Stitch 
Note: Currently if you didn't get a Founders Pack and this became F2P at this moment, you would pretty much have guaranteed Mickey, Donald and Goofy and get a decent quantity of Shards for others (due to the random nature you could get multiple new ones but it's not guaranteed).",1.0

From what I could glimpse of the different choices, things can go in drastically different directions, which is very impressive and offers a unique experience for every player, which is one of the best things about interactive fiction, when done right (and it is done right here).

The plot is really solid, the characters distinct and lovable, and the writing fun and snappy. I was very invested in the story, the pack and the MC, making the stakes high.

The only thing that I wished was a little more developed was the MC's history. It's mentionned briefly a couple of times which left me wanting to know more. [spoiler]Meeting the MC's father also felt a bit bare bones, it felt like there should have been more to it.[/spoiler]

You have to truly ponder what decisions you have made along the way that brought you to the place of your final reckoning.

It is still unclear, even to me, why I purchased Volcano Princess.
There isn't anything wrong with it, with those nudity scenes throughout it's perfectly stellar. But when you look at it as a choice, you realize just how flawed you and the rest of humanity is.

What drove me to purchase such a game? What part of my soul felt so empty that I thought a virtual girl could fill it?
When I look into the boundless depths of my own loneliness I see a pool of reflection. My face isn't there, there is no face. There are only tears in that pool, tears of shame and loss and confusion.

If it were up to me again I know I would purchase it in a heartbeat, I know I would load it up and skip through the countless window prompts so I can have a single morsel of pornographic images which are readily available online.
Yet, despite the abundance of naked virtual women waiting in the digital sphere, I still chose to purchase this game and devote hours of my life to it. That time will never return to me, it is lost just like my soul and just like the time I fear I may never find it again.

There is something broken within me, something that desires sensation beyond my reach, something that whimpers every single night with the knowledge that there is no true Princess, it is a merely an illusion.
In my pursuit to find meaning in this long life, I sought the colorful lights and sounds of a world that only exists in a pop up window on my computer.

I am unsure what the moral of this review is, I am unsure about my place within the universe, all I know is that no amount of virtual girls can cure the vast rot that has overtaken me.",1.0

[b]+ A Thrilling Horror Adventure Ecchi Game!ヽ(´• ω •`)、[/b]

[h1][b][1] Intro [/b][/h1]
The Monstrous Horror Show is a thrilling horror adventure game with RPG elements that will test your courage, puzzle-solving skills, and survival instincts. Above all, what sets this game apart from others in the genre is the inclusion of hentai content, which can be unlocked through a special H-patch provided by the publisher. This content enhances the value of the game, adding some ecchi or hentai elements to the already engaging gameplay.

[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]

The game is a visual treat with its amazing pixel art that immerses you in the eerie atmosphere of the abandoned hospital. The four heroines have unique characteristics and backstories that add depth and complexity to the overarching tale. As you progress through the game, you'll uncover clues, solve puzzles, and confront terrifying monsters that will make your heart race and your palms sweat.

The gameplay is intuitive and engaging, with a variety of challenges that keep you on your toes. You'll have to explore every nook and cranny of the hospital to find useful items and clues. The puzzles are cleverly designed and require both logic and creativity to solve. You'll also have to outrun and hide from monsters, and sometimes even confront them with whatever weapons you can find.

[h1][b][3] Verdict [/b][/h1]
In conclusion, The Monstrous Horror Show is a well-crafted horror adventure game with a unique twist. It is a game that will keep you on edge from start to finish, and leave you with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment when you finally escape the horrors of the abandoned hospital. The inclusion of adult content adds an extra layer of excitement and sensuality to the gameplay, making it a great choice for players looking for something a bit different.

6876,137104570.0,1851030,"As someone who enjoys both Fighting Games and Rhythm Games, this game lacks a lot of the QoL options many modern iterations of those games have.

As a fighting game player, this game lacks a lot of quality of life features, especially an inability to change the controls upon character select, but also the tutorial seems broken in that the special button does not work properly in mirrored CPU mode so you can't practice special inputs with characters and especially you can't practice charge characters properly. The health is also so far from the chart that it feels impossible to tell who is in the lead until the chart starts flashing red.

From the rhythm game sides of things, the only note speed options are in training mode for some reason. There is no way to change offset between different controllers to potentially account for different input delays, especially between wired and wireless controllers, which usually wouldn't be an issue for fighting games, but given there is the timing aspect of rhythm games giving you different strengths it feels like a strange oversight. The area that the chart is on is so small for the amount of notes you have that reading can get really hard that it feels like really dumb levels of memorisation. The organisation of charts for each map feels bizarre as it doesn't sort by difficulty for some reason. In fact there aren't really any way to sort charts to begin with.

Also there isn't a mode that lets you play the game like a normal rhythm game which feels like it leads to the charts ending up rather unmemorable. Like, it's ONLY focused on the fighting game 1v1 aspect when it really feels like so much more could have been done with this game.

This game is honestly a massive disappointment to what could have been such a great and novel experience.",0.0

The ability command troops more effectively is the TOP priority. game looks good, runs well, but theres problems with random mouse sensitivity that im seeing, suddenly whooshing your camera around. 

The gameplay is pretty good, moving around the world map is fluid and not tedious. The building system is alright, clearly designed for controller not keyboard and mouse, it lacks precision when building structures that a mouse affords (the objects ur building slide a bit as the camera influences the position of the mouse)

Sounds quality is decent, voice over can be a be cringe but im a cynical bastard xD

Coop is kinda trash as you both use the same unit pool and resources, as well as the fact that once a troop is rallied to you, the other player cannot effect them with their banner calls. Meaning one player ends up having all the troops and the other player has to pick up random mobs that are mulling around.

not alot of the game is explained, whether thats designed or not i cant tell. all ill say is that dont immediately destroy ""portals"", destroy all the buildings first otherwise youll screw yourself over, Really wish this was explained somewhere. i DO recommend the game, but $50 bucks AUD is a bit steep for the content, specially seeing as it comes with an ingame shop.",1.0

Too many times have developers pawned out unfinished games that end up being husks of what was promised. I don't know if this game will be any different, but this game really caught my attention.

While the game itself feels like it requires much more work, the framework seems to be really sturdy, as in they have the foundation finished, all they need to do is focus on the smaller (but vital) details. The devs seem to be in touch with the community and it seems like there's actual hope for this to become a fleshed out title.

While many failed attempts have been made to capture this genre, I sincerely believe that these developers have managed to figure it out. As long as they continue to work on the game, I believe this game can revolutionize the RTS/FPS hybrid genre.

In its current state, the game feels nowhere near finished but is still playable and has some fun moments. I only give this positive review to support the devs in their endeavor. If this just ends up being another quick money grab, I'll change my review at some point.",1.0

1) always hire people at the minimum salary.  There is basically no downside to this.

Same for research, only one thing at a time regardless of resources. No research points or anything like that to make research more interesting. Production takes far too long for ammo and the like. 

FPS game play is limited and not great UI. The strategic gameplay UI is awful. The screen can only move with WSAD and does not work with the mouse pointer at the edge of the display in map mode which is frustrating. Clicking on a unit opens up the unit org window and that covers a large portion of the map. Setting unit equipment is difficult. I can't easily pick and choose. It's either a rifle or a pistol, not both. No grenades for the soldiers no med kits. You can't stack battalions at locations, only one can occupy a town at a time. I would like to be able to stack battalions to make brigades. No mortars, no HMGs. No way of building up defensive positions to defend against attack, troops seem to start outside of town if they are not the garrison when it should be that if a force battalion is garrisoned along with the ""local Garrisoned"" then they are also in the town. You have no time to prepare a defence of the town when it is attacked either. It's a bit naff really.

It's trying to be Freeman but with much less playability or depth. Bit rubbish at the minute and needs a lot of work to bring it up to an enjoyable playing experience not least because logistics and diplomacy are so 2 dimensional and linear. One thing at a time please... no multi tasking here.

Who knows, in a year or so it might be better but I can't recommend it right now",0.0

The game IS early access but this scratches that Davigo/Panopticon itch I've had for a while - without the need for remote playtogether!

What I didn't dig: The UI is clunky on a controller or on a keyboard - unskippable cutscenes or the ones that are don't respond to input.

The atmosphere is fantastic, but as many have noted gets a bit troublesome the further in you go. Whether good or bad that is left up to the player. I feel it adds an extra layer of terror. 

Onto the island size, it is indeed overly large, even with multiple people especially with how slow you move at any given time. Although I have a rough idea of how the island looks in my head as far as landmarks and can probably decently well navigate it now, I am also aware most people aren't good at doing that in their head. Potentially would benefit from having a map system of some type, maybe with a map that fills in as you explore, or some way to set 'markers' of some type.

I can see the devs are hard at work already with updates to try and fix the AI to a satisfactory level so I will only state that it needs some work but as a foundation is pretty good. The tracking system for things like pages and all isn't bad but the intensity of the glow can be difficult to discern especially when you have to physically look down in the game to be able to properly see the book.

Overall I can't wait to see more because the game still is in early access, and as long as things are followed up I believe that this will end up being a pretty great Lovecraftian game.

The controls are as simple as they come and you can tailor how fast paced you want the gameplay to be with your choice of song, allowing you to go in all guns blazing to smash your previous high score or take a more leisurely stroll and chill out with some good tunes. Speaking of music, the soundtrack is fantastic and really adds to the experience. If you tire of the provided tracks then you can import your own music too.

I usually give games with mixed reviews on release a miss for a while but I'm glad I didn't with this one. It seems that the negative reviews are based on changes between demo and release which is unfortunate and you can't miss something you never had, so if you didn't play the demo you can take those comments with a pinch of salt. The devs also look to be very responsive so I'm sure any of the changes that are missed will be implemented again in the future to build on the fantastic foundation.

And the most important bit - the default FOV is actually usable and doesn't immediately need raising (110).

Specs: 6900hx, 32GB RAM, 2TB 4thGen SSD & 3080ti-16GB. 

Developers, please do some optimisation in the EA phase or at least introduce DLSS, DRS or some equivalent technology to increase the frames. There is also a memory leak - as the fps drops the more you play - restarting the game sorts this out. Usually can play for around an hour or so before it becomes noticeable....

Loving the game overall though - like the concept & wave mechanic. There is a lot of potential here to develop a game with  high replay value. Only played a little multiplayer, seems to work fine - not a lot of people online atm - best to play with friends. Maybe a dedicated server option will be offered?

7027,137118599.0,2321210,"This game is subpar

Just a couple of quick points for skim readers;
Music isn't very good (even though the kinda whole aesthetic is about music?????)
Not very hard, levels felt tedious with the difficulty curve very very gradual 
Abilities/Upgrades aren't big variations to gameplay/low impact
Progression also feels very off
If you're here for the visual novel whatever part the english voice acting is subpar

Long notes 
>The abilities are the weakest part of the game, my taste in rogue likes (synthetik, nuclear throne, binding of isaac, enter the gungeon) all have big focus on weapons and upgrades changing your playstyle run to run, this is not present at all in this game, upgrades are minor changes and the actual combat is very weak consisting of spamming buttons to hit your enemies. I initially was hoping for a rhythm based combat similar to crypt of the necrodancer since the game does have your abilities become strengthed if played on the right beat however the concept is not explored at all. 
Basically COMBAT is very weak, may look stylish to some but i feel isn't very deep complex or has any variation.
>Feeding into above your ability upgrades don't seem to effect gameplay or playstyle at all, just  simple stat changes so again very low variation on combat. 
>MUSIC IS NOT GOOD, this is a game with a hint of focus on rhythm and the entire theme being about a world of weird music corrupting people, and you give me the most bland ost i've ever heard in my life, get the boys who made synthetik to whip something up for you please if the music was a 7/10 i would consider not refunding this game. 

Overall I don't think its an enjoyable experience, feel free to try the game but gameplay isn't that good. Game does seem to have some weird husbando waifu component which i don't think is that deep but if you want to play it for that the world is your oyster. 

Not worth it 2/10 maybe comeback if they update combat.",0.0
7028,137117855.0,2321210,"I bought this game on a whim the day it came out and its just pretty good straight up. 

For the short of it its like a simpler neon anime Dead Cells with extremely light rhythm game elements. 

So basically this game is like if that mobile game Dislyte was a actual game and also good mixed with Dead Cells. Originally I thought the music theme of the game was just for flavour but it bleeds into mechanics like upgrades and the skill attack which surprised me. The art style is cute and dripping in neon. Now this game is Chinese so the audio and text only come in Mandarin and English and beyond some missed translations and occasional subtitle missteps its extremely competent. The voice acting is actually pretty good for English its not like some half trying effort and its admirable, like there are some accents you can hear but its not bad at all so good job on that. 

As for gameplay its pretty simple but inoffensive. You have a attack, a slam from the air, a unique ability per character, a skill, and a ult. Builds havent got too crazy for me yet but i can see potential. Theres a per run upgrade system that is randomized which is unique. Think like a skill grid and you put chips you find in and the grids effects are shuffled so you cant ever really build the same twice, though while this is unique it isnt gonna break a run only elevate it really. 

The only negative things I can think of is that levels are fairly short but thats subjective, and the timing/rhythm skill mechanic which might turn some people off. Personally I think its fine but some people might not like the control over which version of the skill you use.  

If I can be real this game seems like a mobile game that the developer just changed into a full game which isnt a bad thing in the slightest. Ive played a ton of gacha games and this has all the makings of one from how the menus are laid out to currency but since its not tied to micro transactions at all, its well put together.

Pros:

The RTS/FPS merge is amazing and i always love when a game does that.

The ""mount and blade"" like open world and city building is an amazing combination with the RTS IMO.

Graphics are nice, sound is nice too, can use some improvement i think but its nowhere near immediate. 

Moving on to cons:

I think it would be helpful in the resource management bar to have gains and losses so that i can prioritize what settlements  need to produce what resource to get me back in the green. 

Recruiting squads is a bit rough, it would be nice to see unit composition before i recruit them so that i know what kind of unit im building. I do like that the recruited units build up over time, simulates recruitment training and is a nice touch. 

More on squads, when building a custom preset squad, I think it would be more useful if the equipment options were limited to the research that you have completed, otherwise id be building a squad preset that i cannot use at the moment. 

When it comes to research, i think its a bit slow to be limited to researching one time from one tree at a time, it might be better to be able to research one item from each tree at a time. However i have not been playing very long and maybe that's for balance.

7045,137119034.0,1537830,First want to say yes the gameplay is good however be aware if you buy the standard pack and then decided you wanted to upgrade you're going to have to pay for the full price as if you didn't buy the standard one to begin with.  Now if you want to play only solo you will most likely get stuck from progressing in tracks.  Honestly I don't have issues with paying for cosmetics like character looks or vehicles but to continue with a game it seems a little unfair since it's not a cheap game to begin with.  So my issues are more around progression in gameplay.  If they had just made it where you can play then add dlc for bonus gameplay without the confusion within the game no issue.  With that being said the game itself has good graphics there are some glitches but expected for early access.  The tracks are fun to play.  The music and character sayings are fun to hear.  So the actual gameplay is good which is why I said yes to recommending it.  And if you say well it says dlc for the other editions that's a little misleading cause you can't actually buy what they call dlc without spending the amount for the standard game itself with it.  A dlc is separate and if you can't afford it right away you might buy it later but that's not how this one works.,1.0

Besides the refund I'll still leave a negative review as this game might have some decent gameplay mechanics which I can't complain about after 36 mins of gametime but the amount of menu's and in game currencies designed to get more money from you on every button press is insane and was my main reason to refund this hot pile of dung until it goes free2play eventually.

Sequel features more combat and moving around quickly, with dozens of secret rooms. But it also requires a lot less thinking, the puzzles are more about execution and precision.

The main story is nearly same length as the first game, so don't expect the game to be long (out of my hours 2-3 were the game running on background). If you will only play the main story the game might even feel lacking, so I highly recommend finding the secrets. The optional rooms also have the most challenging rooms in the game while the main story is easier this time (but just like before, the final boss is not a total pushover which I appreciated).

The controls were mostly fine, but they could've still been more refined. Same with the magnetic physics, now and then completely unexpected bounces happen (which might or might not benefit you). And obtaining certain powers can cause problems when you would not want to use them (The ground pound move in general happened accidentally a lot, and the blink axe power against the final boss where enemies are often behind wires made it harder to hit them.)

The magnetic axe is a great idea. a double jump exists in the game, but using the axe to help launch yourself in the air lets you do very high jumps. Without the magnetism it would've been just a God of War's Leviathan Axe ripoff. I also enjoyed how fast you can slide.

I was disappointed that there is still no method to warp between areas, especially now that the map is larger than before. It makes returning to places more cumbersome when you have to claw yourself back out from wherever you go. And think twice before dropping down, I had to repeat entire areas more than once because I fell down and the game autosaved the moment I landed. So my tip is, if you're falling big time without meaning to, quickly exit the game before the autosave makes you swear.

Just to check that is wasn't my P.C's issue, I turned the res to 150% and custom to 100% and went into Half Life Alyx with high settings and everything was fine.

Until this game gets an update, increasing performance, unfortunately I can't recommend this game as it is right now.",0.0

7077,137119874.0,2320910,"I have a lot of nostalgia for old school designed shooters over the grey and muddy modern military games and generally New Blood tends to produce what I want. I was more of a Quake/Doom/Duke Nukem fan over Hexen or Heretic, which this game is more heavily inspired by. It probably is why pre the VR port I wasn't as interested in the game overall. 

However, I'm only about 1 1/2 hours into this version but I honestly was having a hard time putting it down when I bought it last night. This is a stark contrast to me playing it pre VR. The port to VR actually adds a lot to the experience of playing this and has made the exploration and general feeling of the game a lot better to me.

At its core I think the way that a lot of the weapons work makes them feel cool and novel in a way that makes them extremely fun to use. I find it extremely fun to just swing your sword and have the projectile go in the direction you look. I like swinging it in time to cancel an enemy projectile attack. It is all extremely fun and intuitive and shows that there was work to make this feel good in VR. The momentum detection feels just right for how much you have to swing. I have a feeling that extended play sessions may give me serious tennis elbow potentially. 

The environmental design is extremely cool and exploring the areas that they've constructed is extremely compelling. The updated lighting model of UE4 contrasting with a Quake 1 style of environmental design feels in a lot of ways like the 2d-3d RPG games that are coming out of Square. The sense of scale you get when you are actually in VR makes the world almost come alive. I find myself spending a lot of time exploring the world to find all the secrets they have.

I do unfortunately have some issues with the AI. They tend to get stuck on simple objects sometimes and their pathfinding could be better. I think that this can make some of the enemy encounters too easy and I am probably going to start over on the harder difficulty to see if that works better for me. I do find myself not dying that often and my health tends to be past its maximum point for almost 90 percent of me playing (thanks to health upgrades and some of the predictable patterns of enemies).

Overall this is solid so far. I am looking forward to any new New Blood VR ports in the future. The Teem Beef ports of classic FPS games to VR does show that putting these types of experiences in VR makes them more interesting. I am glad that an actual studio is doing the work to do this themselves. I look forward to playing more of this (and potentially updating this review to have more of a mechanics deep dive when I do).",1.0

7100,137125999.0,1627510,"Ok wow! This game is very different from what i've played and reviewed so this might get kind of long...

The game is fantastic, it has a beautiful aesthetic and pixel art and this could very well turn into an amazing project given the right things are done to it and the developer still plans to expand and work on this piece.

The game as of playing it on April/22/2023 feels incomplete there are a lot of inconsistencies and areas to easily softlock if you exit your mech at the wrong times. (Although you're not supposed to exit the mech at those moments it just feels kind of ""unplanned"" whenever you want to try something and you end up having to reset the game).

I haven't finished the game yet but this is what I found so far...

The music repeats, there needs to be more soundtracks, I noticed from the dev's previous response that this is a glitch but i'd love to hear what the other soundtracks sound like. 

The very first stage has a place where you can go out of bounds of the map and die its pretty funny.

The Aligator boss almost always drops his core inside the wall making it inaccessible 90% of the time (Maybe replace the core spawn to the center of the stage instead). 

The second ""drill boss"" doesn't even spawn a core (unsure if it was supposed to). and the boss also spawned with partial health (Again not sure if it was supposed to).

I wish there was omnidirectional shooting, that would make things more immersive, or at least as an upgrade option (didn't see it as one but if there is later in the game feel free to correct me). 

The second stage also relies on a some of ""leaps of faith"" down holes and crevices where you are unsure if you're actually supposed to go down there or you die trying to find out. Would be nice to have some context clues or indicators showing the path that is needed to follow. (Sloping floors, elevators, breakable blocks, or if you wanna be lazy arrow signs lol etc).

The story itself is very basic, Nothing much is explained or given, I feel like this game could have an amazing storyline, maybe as you're defeating bosses you extract something from them (a vial of stomach acid from the aligator, or a mini cutscene where you rip out the robot's drill arms and take them with you and use those ""parts"" in the store to upgrade your weaponry and arsenal giving you weapons such as an acid shot or a drill weapon to access hidden areas etc.) 

It would also be cool that as you upgrade your robot his AI is also evolving giving him a more ""human"" personality. I could see this as being an iconic ending where in the end the robot rips out his own buster to give to the kid in order to save his life while he stays behind and you have to run out of an exploding building or base of sorts. 

All in all, this game has a LOT of potential, I hope the developer continues to work on this and expands it with more ideas and mechanics as it has the potential to be one of the next best sidescrollers out there.

The game has no sex unfortunately so i'll have to dock a point from the overall score :^)

I have to say, the game looks great and it has its own unique mechanic which is faithful to Sylas from League. The chain system/aiming system for spells is very clunky to begin with and it feels weird. Even after 2hrs and getting used to it on Kingslayer difficulty it doesn't feel fluid at times as some other platformers. 

At the price-point its disappointing because the Level design is kinda linear with a chest here and there, but other-ways you are always on the story path. Also a 35 quid game not having V/O is kinda insane.

[/th][/table]

Is this game a masterpiece? It is a very good looking metroidvania, but without the typical combat. Actually, it is a quite unusual metroidvania. We play a little girl named Luminia (who first appeared in the game World to The West), who is hunted by humans and gets eaten alive by most animals or plants she encounters. She runs away as fast as she can from most foes, only sometimes she uses the environment to get a little revenge and kill an enemy. Lumina was flying along in her little zeppelin, when she got attacked and her blimp shot down in an abandoned region. The aim of the game is to return home. She is a Teslamancer, which means she controls electricity. She may not have an attack, but she starts the game with the ability to dash. Very soon she finds a dress with magical properties, which allow her to use magnetic force and polarities. At least I think that it is a magnetic force that allows her to run along walls or fly up in (magnetic?) currents. There is no speech in the game. There is also no text in the game. So some things might be a bit hard to understand - visual storytelling may be an art, but can't easily explain everything.

During the game, Lumina learns new abilities by obtaining new equipment, which allow her to access areas that have been so far unreachable. A typical metroidvania game element - but the abilities are not typical. No walljump or double jump, but fast swimming or a block-breaking slide. Even the fast travel is different than in most metroidvanias. There are no teleporting portals, but there is a central hub and cables that Lumina can move on using her electromagnetic powers. So she can reach the various regions in the game, like the castle, a snowy mountain or the flooded caves.

In the course of the game, you shouldn't expect direct confrontations with the enemies, especially at the beginning of the game. Lumina has no attacks and has to use her dash ability to move quickly and avoid certain death. She is attracted or repelled by certain platforms, and the main gameplay challenge is how to reach the next room while at the same time not getting killed by various deadly things (spikes, electricity fields...) or enemies. She often has to run while being chased by something deadly. While you learn to fight to survive in most metroidvanias, here you need to learn how to move fast, using your various abilities. There are some challenging, frustrating moments due to complex puzzle-platforming elements. Boss fights are also special, you have to think of ways to damage bosses without having an attack. If you die, you reappear at one of the many checkpoints. This is more like Limbo, there is no real punishment for dying, apart from being very annoying and having to go again through some places you already managed to survive.

Gamepad is of course supported. To return home doesn't take too long, but there are 81 cards are hidden in the game for completionists. Also other stuff is hidden and not necessary to finish the main story, like extra abilities. The visuals and animations are amazing, the game is really a little beauty.

[u][b] Conclusion:[/b][/u]

7124,137127067.0,2320910,"[h1]Disclaimer[/h1]
I only played the first level, but this is the same game as base Amid Evil, which I already finished 2 times. Consider this to be just an opinion on the VR port, not a full-game review. Look at my original Amid Evil review for that:
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998873734/recommended/673130?snr=1_5_9__402

Played on HTC Vive while standing.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
Store page proudly states ""This is not some half-baked version of AMID EVIL ported to VR, this is the REAL DEAL""

Eh...

It's ok, but it's also pretty lazy. Amid Evil is good, but I don't know if VR really plays to it's fast-paced action. Frankly I don't recommend Amid Evil VR unless you already played the pancake version, but if you already played it, then this VR version is hard to recommend since it's the same game.

Having a discount if you already own the original is nice, but not enough to warrant this purchase.

[h1]Description[/h1]
It's largely the same as the normal Amid Evil. Maps have small tweaks (I think?), but overall feel and look same.

So the main difference is the controls. You can use the left touchpad on the Vive to move around like using an analog stick on a controller. Pressing on it will jump. Pressing on the right touchpad will turn you (can be set to snap with configurable degrees or set to smooth turn if your stomach can take it like the real VR-slave you are).

You select weapons from a selection wheel by holding the right option button. You attack depending on the weapon. I only played first level and I don't remember many secrets, so I only tried out the Axe, Water Staff and the Sword.

Axe is swung and it automatically hits if your swing has decent arc and momentum. No need to hold attack button.

Water Staff is aimed with your hand and fired with a button.

Sword is interesting - you aim it with your face and have a crosshair that follows your head movement. While swinging sword like the axe, you create projectiles that will aim themselves in the direction of the crosshair, which follows your head movements.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ It's still the same good game as it was[/b]
I fully recommend pancake Amid Evil.

[b]+ Elegant aiming solution[/b]
I was worried they would just have the sword fire as you press the button, which would make it suck in terms of VR engagement. However making projectiles by swinging is present in the game and you aiming with your face means you can be accurate while swinging. Nice.

I suspect the Morning Star has the same mechanics, while other weapons probably fire normally.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Lazy[/b]
It is lazy. I did not see anything about new weapons, enemies or levels on the front page, so you effectively just pay for a VR port. It's an ok port, I guess, but when I think VR fps, I think HL Alyx or Boneworks, hell even H3VR. Games that take advantage of the VR controls to the fullest.

Here you play the same game as we did several years ago, but this time you get tired and a little bit VR-sick after playing for a while AND you are not as precise as with normal KB+M controls, so gameplay suffers a bit.

I guess there's room for a classic FPS in VR, but it's just a shame that we already played the version that feels as solid to control as the pancake Amid Evil.

So, in general, it's an underwhelming experience.

[h1]Lowdown[/h1]
Not really worth it. I'm not sure if I will care enough to finish it. I'd probably have more fun replaying the pancake version.

I'd give Amid Evil VR a

People say fast-action shooters don't work in VR. They say that it's ""vomit-city"" and no one will play it... well here is AMID EVIL in VR. And my god is it a rush! It is fast pace, there is a lot of verticality, jumping, and a lot of things that you ""should never do in VR""... this game says fuck that... and I must say, I want more games like this in VR! Here is more proof that Boomer shooters do work in VR. Like I have said before, there are lots of people who get motion sickness from roller coasters, but there are still lots of people who enjoy roller coasters, that's us who love fast-action in VR.

I have got to say 'Thank you' to the devs that translated this game in VR! It plays wonderfully!",1.0
7126,137125896.0,2320910,"Spectacular Virtual Reality Power applied to an already amazing boomer shooter.
You can swing your sword and see the wave flying out of it, you can aim perfectly with your hand while circle strafing that giant monster that you can see in front of you in real life-size scale.

I'm going to finish this game entirely starting it from scratch again from the previous Flat version.

What I can recommend is 
1) buy it immediately
2) Start playing it on HARD : because being able to see with complete freedom,  and have perfect aim with your hands will give you an edge that Non-VR players cannot have on the Flat version of the game. So Hard difficulty will feel a little more balanced.
3) Remove the Aiming Reticle, use your eyes with the true power of VR on your weapons :)

I will upload gameplay video soon from a more advanced part of the game.
The game is blast !!

Best in person but still amazing over discord, Teamwork and finding your role in the party is just as important as getting as much loot and treasure as you can.

After the first chapter the game takes a bit of a turn and ultimately isn't as scary, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

I loved the aesthetic of the fun house portion and felt that all the different parts of the game felt varied with their own style and gameplay (one particularly tense section has you use your scanner to detect enemies).

I really like that they decided to keep the difficulty of puzzles reasonable, rather than obscuring them to the point that you need to take half an hour to advance through another room, as it may happen in some other games (hello, CrossCode). I liked the story and the way the developers presented it (through visuals only). Overall, it took me 6.2 hours to complete the game with all collectibles.

Some things that were a bit annoying is that you only have 1 hp, so you must master boss patterns to proceed, and also the game map was very impractical, as the game doesn't show your exact position, and does not allow you to scroll the map.",1.0

7168,137129972.0,1679290,"The particular system of non-RTS simultaneous turns that this game employs is very unique as far as strategy gaming is concerned. It plays like a board game given the lack of randomness and pure strategy. Furthermore, the massive amount of maps and units that can be employed allows for countless strategies with subtle nuances among them all. Deciding how you best like to combine different units into formations and to fulfill the correct niche provides ample opportunity to customize your playstyle so that it is unlikely that anyone else has exactly the same strategy. Some battles are won before they start when one side has developed a composition tailored to the map while the other has just mindlessly chosen the big scary units, yet most battles aren't decided until the very end since the system allows for clever or surprising maneuvers to suddenly turn the tide of battle.

My favorite part is the multiplayer as you get to test your mettle against someone else's wit in a timed challenge where every moment counts. Especially when you have many orders to issue, you need to make sure to prioritize your focus on the most important fronts of the battle. The campaign mode is also very interesting to play through as you need to manage the needs of your whole army beyond just the context of the battle. Logistics, money management, and more are all broader challenges that must be considered as well as winning battles and limiting casualties.

The historical accuracy and flavoring is just icing on the cake as well with lovely unit designs and fun voice acting. The graphics are nothing exceptionally revolutionary, but they are still nice graphics that even my toaster of a computer can handle.

There are a couple bugs here or there that are left, but most of the truly problematic or game breaking ones have been squashed by now. Plus, the development team is very responsive to community feedback and are always hard at work ironing things that are pointed out.

typical tile-switching puzzler with rotatable pieces and [b]35 levels[/b] unlocked one by one. create paths for buses and trains, so the former can visit all the stops before they all leave through their respective tunnels, then start the route. [b]speed settings available[/b] for less waiting. gotta deal with elevation changes too, and since they can cross paths, [b]traffic lights are necessary[/b] to avoid collisions. should one happen, you can make the necessary changes without re-doing the entire level, then try again. what's more, [b]progress is saved when you quit[/b]. mostly unnecessary but a pleasant surprise. [b]a supposedly quick soft-reset results in a loading screen and a camera reset[/b], a lot less pleasant.

[b]I found difficulty uneven[/b], no curve, feels like level order just got randomized. those junction bits that are both straight and a turn were way too frustrating to figure out, there used to be very subtle differences that caused me an unreasonable amount of grief on level 14 and some more later. now they're easier to read with big arrows.

[b]non-rebindable mouse-based controls with some hotkeys.[/b] mouse stuff isn't shown anywhere, left click to pick up and place tiles, rotate with wheel on mouseover or while they're being held. hold right click and the wheel to mess with the camera, wheel zooms if it's not over a piece. the usual stuff, but it'll be somebody's first game and they might not be familiar. hotkeys bring up the menu, soft-reset the level and start and speed up the goings-on.

good enough presentation, relaxing music, colorful little diorama-like towns. can be daytime or night, various seasons, clear weather, rain or snow, but [b]hot air balloons are always in the way[/b]. settings are adequate and available anytime. separate volumes, resolutions, windowed mode, some languages, v-sync, graphics quality, shadows, msaa, ssao, hdr.

the game could've been called [b]traffic puzzle[/b] (or probably something less generic), but I guess [b]railway islands[/b] has become popular enough to name this after (so much so that its price keeps going up for no reason, hopefully won't be the case here). it's okay overall, but plenty of similar games around, so [b]not a must-have unless you have a traffic fetish[/b].",1.0

7189,137129903.0,1860510,"So first off I want to say that this is early EA. Its very rough but has a good foundation and concept. Has a similar open world mechanic as mount and blade games but is bare bones. This can be compared to games like freeman: guerrilla warfare and mount and blade. I streamed this for about an hour and a half if anyone wanted to see footage. Most of the time I was just trying to figure out controls and mechanics without watching youtube. There is some frustration in the video though.

Pros:
-FPS and RTS, easy to swap between both.
-RTS controls are easy but take some time to learn.
-Good foundation for a game of this style.
-Active devs (I know it just released).

Cons:
-When you die in FPS mode it takes a while for the game to give you another person to control.
-Open world is hard to understand.
-Tutorial is a youtube video series and steam guide.
-Vehicles die too fast to RPGs. Realistic but frustrating.
-Hard to see enemies while they shoot you from ridiculous ranges.
-Only able to build one building at a time in open world.
-Cities starve fast because of a lack of food and unable to make more until you build production for it.
-Creating battalions takes too long because of required reserves and weapons. Only 1 troop replenished a day. (When you have a battalion of 300 soldiers you need to wait 200+ days for them to be full strength again???)
-Hard to assign equipment to units. In 2 hours of playing I still have no idea how to do that. I created custom squad designs but the troops still don't use the equipment assigned even when they are garrisoned at a city that has it.

But remember this is an EA game, its very EA in my opinion. When in battles I would be able to enjoy myself though. So while this needs a lot of work I will give this a recommended. I like to support EA games and as long as they stick to fixing issues and fulfilling this game I will be happy.
P.S. devs please work on issues or concepts one at a time. Don't try to multi-task like others. Give your best to one concept at a time so you can make it as good as you can!",1.0

7192,137129346.0,2069340,"I really wanted to like this game, but the gameplay is very dissapointing. the game has a really nice presentation but everything else is completely lacking. 

the ui is very charming, the SFX feels impactful and the soundtrack includes several indie bands that really give the feeling that a lot of soul was put into the game. 

this game plays like its made by someone who has never played a tony hawk game. every decent skateboarding game ever has a jump on button release, this one jumps on press making the ollie feel less impactful. you can't do multiple tricks off of an ollie. grinding rails have no momentum, they're just rollercoaster tracks and jumping on and off multiple are nearly impossible. this is basically a skateboarding game that doesn't allow for player expression.

the level design is very shoddy, eg: the entire intro section is built of floating parts, you can fall through the level,
the ramps are completely useless except for 1 part where you need to grind some rail. 

the enemies kinda all do the same thing, theres sections where there's an abundance of them in the map and you dont even interact with like 80% of them. all the objectives are the same in each section except the amount you need to kill. it doesn't feel very well thought out.

there's several weapon combinations but they all seem to do the same thing. also the crafting menu says i have weapons when i don't have the rocket launcher. if you're going to have an inventory system give let the player decide what to do with their inventory.",0.0

7194,137133581.0,1929250,"Fun lil bullet hell/VS game that allows you to live out your Jaeger dreams and smash the pitiful opposition. It has a variety of cool weapons and only 3 mech's but looks like quite a few are planned, hopefully some out of the box designs are in store.

Some aspects of this game really stand out from other similar games, the variety of enemies and their patterns are pretty unique and add a lot of flavor. Not only do you have different enemies that may either try to ram you or stay back and snipe, ive also noticed the spawn patterns allow some to spawn in little bands that you have to play around or come in a little faster. While not crazy, I feel these extra twists will really make this title stand out, especially for a small team like this.

I'm just hoping in the future there are more integrations between the different upgrades, some elements I never really get just because I would always choose straight damage compared to them- similar with the armor upgrades, which you wouldn't really want to get unless you are almost dead. Maybe some feature that allows combinations of upgrades to more incentivize going for certain upgrades that may not as exciting on their own, and add to the replay-ability. 

But overall, would recommend to anyone looking to bap around some people and tanks as a giant mech. I hope this title gets the attention it deserves and the content keeps rolling in.",1.0

Overall, the game was fun with an interesting story however left the constant feeling of ""missed opportunity"".
The puzzles were not really puzzles since it was running from A to B basically - if not rather annoying mazes. I also expected this game to be a very atmospheric horror experience since I played the demo a few months back. If you liked the demo and expect the game to be equally good (and HORROR), I would not recommend you to buy it. Stick with the demo and enjoy what you got there. If you are up for an adventure in a dungeon crawler type of game with rather easy puzzles and a nice story ""Suffer The Night"" might entertain you for some hours. 

Unfortunately, to me ""Suffer The Night"" could not keep up with its very promising prolog and setup of the game... maybe its just my expectations. The developers tried something different (I appreciate that) but it feels like they tried to fit in too many genres.

7196,137132412.0,1730080,"This was one of my most anticipated games of the year and it didn't disappoint. Reading the other reviews on here, I can see why people would complain about difficulty and lack of variety in upgrades...but part of it is the point of the game, that people don't have the patience to get to and see, and dismiss the game after two hours of gameplay. 

This is a story game, an adventure, disguised as a roguelike. People wanting the Binding of Isaac or Vampire Survivors are going to be disappointed by this. People that love deep lore, mysteries, puzzles, and unraveling a story hidden within the disguise of good ol fashioned roguelike gameplay will love it. 

It IS hard but there's settings to make it a bit easier and it's all about the journey being difficult that makes the game satisfying. I do think there should be a few more unique bullet upgrades to make runs not feel samey, but again, I don't see this as the kind of roguelike you replay over and over. You eventually reach a point in the game where you feel complete and everything makes sense, and that feeling is worth every penny of the game.",1.0

the multiplayer aspect is alright for me since as of the moment its not too crowded. but really I enjoy single player mode more than before since the various scenarios and campaigns can keep you entertained for a long while.

7219,137134857.0,2189860,"In such a saturated market for this type of game, there's really no reason to buy this one. Aesthetically, I love it. Don't get me wrong, the theme is great and the visuals are fine. But you need to really nail the core gameplay if you're only going to offer a fraction of the content and polish that many other, much cheaper games can deliver. The idea of having a base and doing quests in a Survivor-like is really interesting, I wish it was played out better.

I'll list out the things I particularly disliked:

The persistent progression is very, very slow for this type of game
Weapon and item choice is very limited, and leveling them up is just adding damage or sometimes a projectile. Very little noticeable variation between runs
UI is extremely lacking. Can't even change settings during a run, can't check your stats, weapon details, or anything
Quest objectives are often obscure and hard to find, and it doesn't come off as fun exploration, it comes off as frustrating
The dialogue moves incredibly slow, but skipping it doesn't speed it up, it just skips to the next line. You just have to wait for it, and it is very slow.
I've encountered a couple of run-stopping bugs, where a quest line or character interaction becomes stuck
The controls are very weird on Key/Mouse, they're not as bad on controller

I don't hate this game, I've just played so many better ones that it's hard to recommend this one.

7250,137134966.0,1463780,"This is a really good detective game in the style of Phoenix Wright. More than Phoenix Wright, it makes great use of a very flavorful setting (Ming China/wuxia). It's generally a more serious set of cases than Phoenix Wright, and none of the characters are annoying comic relief. It's hard but usually fair/logical and you get unlimited retries. 

One thing it doesn't do as well as Phoenix Wright is that you can understand a case fully and still get some of the choices wrong because you're thinking through things in a different order than the writers intended. For example, there are two moments when you can challenge a character who claims he brought ""nothing"" by presenting conflicting evidence that specifically mentions he brought a cape. This won't work on the first opportunity. However, later on you get ANOTHER chance to call him out and it works then. In both cases there was enough evidence of a contradiction that calling him out feels like the right move. Only having this work the second time feels weird.

The exiting style of gameplay really makes you feel like a military general at the time, commanding your infantry to victory (or death).
What tops it off is just how stunning the graphics are in the game. I absolutely love the art style, and it just makes the game that much more enjoyable to play.

Obviously, there are many bugs in the game, and you will encounter one atleast once, but they are not prominent enough to truly affect your view on the game.",1.0

You can view my single-player gameplay here: https://youtu.be/Ep5kI19_oi4

I honestly can't review this game. I tried playing online pvp multiplayer, but each time I went up against bots. I honestly don't know if there is a playerbase for this game or not. The focus is obviously on PVP and I don't think it would be fair to score the game without having played online multiplayer.

However, I can say that the single-player content is not worth it. There's only one map. There's only one game mode (besides the tutorial). There are no settings of any kind. The AI bots are basically brain-dead if you skate around the edges of the map, which would be the most logical thing for you to do.

However, skating is fun. I could see this game being fun in PVP MP. Skating is easy to pick-up where you basically just move your body side to side to gain speed and face the direction you want to skate. There is no artificial turning, you must turn IRL, so you do need a swivel chair or to stand IRL. You also have power-ups and a disc weapon you can throw towards enemies. You can also jump or brake. You leave a tron-like trail behind you and you can use it defensively or offensively to cut-off other players. Skating is easy to pick-up, but it can be very challenging to pick-up the kitty & keep other plays from bringing you down, assuming they are not brain-dead like the AI in this game.

It's running on the Unity Engine. On my RTX 3080, I was getting a steady 90 fps. I did not experience any issues or bugs.

7291,137138525.0,1867520,"It's fun.

Decent progression, the concept and story are pretty great. Kind of a Magical Nausicaa vibe, which is fantastic. 

Does it have jank? It's a Unity-engine cutesy-farming game, of course it's got jank. The textures are... questionable, and some of the design choices will drive you mad (The Trader saying ""MORNING"" in the same voice line every time you open his menu.) But it has soul, and the good parts carry through. Broom riding is actually a joy, and significantly better than walking around. All in all, I'd give this a 7/10 (Actual 7/10, not IGN 7/10).

Good things this game does: No enforced sleep cycle. That's right, you can be the witch-gremlin you are IRL, staying up three days straight in a crafting routine until you need to advance time. The harvesting-minigame is surprisingly interesting, especially once you unlock the ability to start snipping at plants to try and maximize yields. Inventory Tetris exists, but is really easy to work with once you get storage.

Anyone having trouble affording upgrades, let me clue you in on a secret: Salsa. The story says that the people are running low on food, but what they're really running low on is salsa. The SECOND you unlock tomatoes, you'll have a money-making machine that will carry you into the endgame by way of flavortown. Anything else you cook should be for quests, or keeping yourself stockpiled to go into the Miasma. Which is a gentle, yet still somewhat tense series of story-dungeons you'll go through.

Pros: 
- Smooth, intuitive controls
- Very cool character-inspired special moves and designs
- Excellent soundtrack that puts driving, energetic twists on old classics
- Gorgeous maps, lots of shortcuts and ways to gain ground 
- Scaling difficulties for those who like a challenge 
- Lots of different pathways to play, for various purposes. Between the ranked/ regulated MP races, the events, the starting circuit, and the seasonal chapters, there is always something to be working toward. 

Cons: 
- Some things cost money to unlock/ attain
- Would be cool if customizations impacted performance
- Characters only have 1 car with various paint jobs, rather than different choices of car
- Very few maps at the moment, though I assume more will be added eventually

As a big fan of league lore, it felt amazing to step into that world and forward the story.
The visuals were awesome and the overall gameplay was pretty fun.

Downsides were that the story was very simple and easily predicted but the characters were great.
The combat did get a bit repetitive after a while, but was still fun.
Finally, binding space for cutscene skipping was a really bad idea. Space is the dash that you will be using all the time, so when a cutscene suddenly happens, you may press it at the same time. This lead to me and the streamers i've watched, accidentally skipping several speech bubbles throughout the whole game. Since its a fast forward skip, you don't realize that it's skipping until the characters are talking and its so fast that you miss several speech bubbles before you're able to stop it.

7304,137139794.0,1681060,"If you love stargate, you'll love it! If not, it's probably missing a wow factor. Really keen to see how this evolves through early access.

The game is a solid base builder where you send teams of explorers out on missions. There are surprisingly few bugs considering how early it is, but there are a few issues with the AI. The gameplay loop is very satisfying. However, balancing/progression is still rocky, as it gets extremely hard to make money in the mid-game. The UI is annoying when you have over 10 staff and several teams. Performance also struggles as you get larger.

The game captures the mystery of exploring new worlds reasonably well, with little choose your own adventure events. These combine to form a narrative - however the pacing of this is a bit off. Writing quality is passable. While the gameplay lends itself to re-playability, but I worry the story won't. The game is built to appeal to Stargate fans, but I feel the implementation, story and art style is actually very bland. So if you aren't a fan of Stargate you may find it lacking much personality or a wow factor.

7305,137140889.0,1928870,"I really dislike the in-game shop, games shouldn't have them. At least give us a way to earn stuff by playing the game.

The next thing is, The campaign is only around 4 hours in a normal play through. Sure, the Main campaign is basically always different since the map changes, but it doesn't change the rather small building selection and pretty... one way using of units.

Basically, once you get creepers you can just... rush to the core and only call creepers, you will be destroying the nether portals within 5 minutes or less. 

The combat is a bit wonky as well. Basically most of the time you will use (A-Move) well known as attack move in the RTS genre. There are ways to select archers and other units individual, but its pretty pointless, Just... send them all in and they even sort them self out.

I haven't Tried the PvP or multiplayer yet, I had no interest in that and it seems rather unbalanced but I can't tell anything about it.

Also, As a last point, from a single player viewpoint its kinda annoying that you gotta be always online, You will lag, fall of cliffs sometimes because you dsync'ed away or somewhere under the map.

7312,137141489.0,1698220,"There's a lot to like here, but there's a few major flaws here that mean I must recommend against purchasing the game.  
The first is a design issue - two actions (slide and ground slam) are mapped to the same button, and sometimes it seems they can activate on positive OR negative edge. So you can start a slide, jump, release slide, and slam yourself into a trap or deadly pit if you're lucky. If you're not lucky, you wind up losing a half an hour of gameplay and have to redo the last zone you're in.   
The second one is that it is bizarrely easy to get softlocked - stuck in an area that the devs clearly didn't seem to think you'd return to at that point. Given the above issues with slamming unexpectedly, and the game's structure, this has happened to me twice in my just under 3 hours with the game.

7313,137140708.0,1679290,"TL;DR: Great take on the idea of turn based strategies, but has some bug issues.

First I'd like to start on the bad, which is the bug issues. To start the UI is a bit buggy, it doesn't work and flow too well, and definitely focuses on looking good while not running too well. For the game itself, it occasionally has a bug that messes with the match or makes the game a lot harder.

However, I personally don't see this as too much of an issue, because of how the development team handles the game. First off, the team is constantly looking for and fixing bugs, with often patches. The development team is also very open about what they're doing (at least on the discord server), often sending announcements about what is going on. And They also put out polls on what to add or change with the game, taking the voice of the community into account, which makes the changes make the most happy. This is also the very first video game this developer has ever made. Armchair historian is a youtube channel, that makes animated history videos on various topics. They had absolutely 0 experience in game making, maybe except for drawing the assets that would be used. They where just a bunch of history guys who wanted to realize an idea, so they made this game. To see a group of animators make a game from nothing with just an idea is impressive, and makes me give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to these things.

Now, to talk about the gameplay. I could not recommend it more to anyone who likes strategy games. It is a turn based strategy where you give your armies orders to fire and move, to attempt to destroy the other army. These orders are neatly organized in a list that you can use to rearrange the orders or cancel them. Once both of the orders are sent, both armies go down the list completing the orders simultaneously. This makes it where you have to predict your opponents moves, because you both are going at the same time, there is no taking turns. This gives the game the stress of a Real Time Strategy, while still giving you breathing room to asses the situation and figure out what to do next. The game's army building is also fun, allowing for every nation to have different playing styles within, and the playing style and strategy changing based on how many units can be afforded. The two time periods also change what you have available to use, creating even more depth. This game is easy to pick up, but has a high skill ceiling. 

Overall, the game isn't perfect, but its still very fun.

I encountered a total of 3 types of monsters in 2 rounds and if you don't light your lantern, you can avoid almost all of them and the game becomes quite boring.
It's sad that small teams come up with a lot of new ideas and colorful game mechanics, but they can't really implement them well, while big companies produce boring template garbage, where only the graphics stand out.

It felt pretty fresh to me and after the somewhat rocky initial part of the game I felt the hook and ended up playing all night. The tedium of the game mellows pretty quickly in my opinion as you just get used to how it works and get faster at doing things.

Toge Productions really managed to make the comfortable vibes of a coffee bar feel so real. The character writing is phenomenal, to where they just... feel like actual people. People with their own history, emotions, personality, desires, experiences. You can feel the time pass between games from seeing the original characters and their plights (idk, i just feel like Lua is older now than before, which I say complimentary). I just really love the urban fantasy setting, how monster rights are ever evolving in modern times.

I really highly recommend both games. Please do yourself a favor and play the first one before getting this. It really is a direct sequel, and I agree with one of the reviewers here: while the ""Episode"" part of the title is nice, it does give a lot of people a ""dlc"" vibe as opposed to sequel vibe, and it can be dropped to just have it be Coffee Talk 2.

7357,137142622.0,1663220,"This is one of the best sequels I have ever played to an already amazing game.

To me, the original Coffee Talk felt so far ahead of its visual novel contemporaries in terms of story and character development. It was hard to imagine that I could get as invested, or let alone more invested, in what followed from the first game. And I won't lie, part of that doubt did come from the untimely passing away of the beloved series' creator, Mohammad Fahmi. His design and writing, as far as I'm aware, played an enormous role in why Coffee Talk looked and felt so unique in the first place. So going into this sequel, I was hoping that what he brought to the original game creatively, in both the design and writing departments, would be preserved.

I got more that what I bargained for with this release.

Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is an amazing continuation that fluidly builds on stories from the old game while also weaving new ones with novel characters and fantastic designs for them, to boot. The new mechanics introduced for coffee-making AND storytelling are one-of-a-kind, something that I didn't even think of as a possibility yet felt so incredibly seamless and natural upon my first impressions of them.

I can't say much more without spoiling this game for anyone reading. This is a masterpiece, and everyone who worked on this game should feel immensely proud for what they've accomplished. Somehow, despite the odds, Hibiscus & Butterfly not only preserved what made the original Coffee Talk so great, but dare I say, /improved/ on the original product.

I have never felt more happy to give a release a positive review. Recommended 100 times out of 10.",1.0
7358,137142721.0,2236240,"Honest Review
What this game is:  2 Hours of Fun + 10 Hours of idle zombie slaughter relaxation.
I recommend for a casual zombie killing farm fest.  It takes a few iterations to your base to see how to kill the most Zombies, but after you settle a layout, its just kill more zombies to get the next upgrade, Go kill survivors for blueprints, come back, modify base, level up turrets, rinse repeat until you don't need any more blue prints and you just grind to 1000000 steal.

Getting the Trophy Table was a bit of a let down.  I wish it would have done some large scale buff or debuff or something.  I feel  with needing 2-3 of the 50,000 steel blueprint tables almost completely upgraded to make it possible to grind to 1000000 steel with the last buff on those tables being 850000, i feel its not worth getting that upgrade until after the trophy table, then  there is no point to grind out 850,000 4 more times just to get everything upgraded because I'm a completionist.   

I recommend if you want a background game to just fill some space in your head while doing other things.  I don't recommend this game if you want a really in depth strategic or very challenging game.

All in all I enjoyed it up until the grind for the Trophy table.  That was just a slog.  I don't currently see much replay value. but for people who like to grind big numbers, it might be something a few people could grind some time into.",1.0

7360,137144025.0,1214670,"The demo is better than its full release in my opinion, two words, Too Punishing (for me at least), experimenting weapons and hats would sometimes lead to death, if you earn all parts of the map then fail to get the crown, I would lose a map part and would have to do another randomly generated mission before retrying the crown mission, which is kinda unforgiving. Resources during some levels are very limited, level objectives weren't clear enough at the start and the list goes on. I started a new save file instead of the demo one(which i deleted, which is likely the wrong choice) because i want it to be fresh for me, but it just didn't feel the same from when i first played the demo

The movement... is pretty bad. The torso and legs move independently of the body - trying to make your dude run backwards is disconcerting.

Combat, which is a rather key component, is lacking hit response.  When I swing a weapon, I expect the zombie to respond... at all. Or when the zombie actually hits me, same deal. Right now, neither are happening until the zombie falls over dead, or you suddenly have half of your life yanked away.

Game hits a number of high notes that I appreciate in an RPG like this. Companion that isn't an annoyance in combat but still talkative and cheerful to lesson the loneliness for the gameplay. Crafting requires slaying mobs and collecting materials from your surroundings, but otherwise you'll likely get all the blueprints you need on your travel. The map isn't sandbox or super open world, you have a solid direction to go, but still plenty of space to look around and explore areas you've been.

As far as ""souls like"", it's kind of not. Variable difficulty setting so you can play the game in story mode if you want, or up the challenge when you feel like it. Clearing all the mobs in an area means they won't return if you die and run back, allowing you to freely explore the area without slogging your way through endless hordes of noodles. You gain experience from kills and just keep that experience. There's no penalty (like respawning mobs) for using the shrines to do mundane stuff like level or save the game or whatever.

Really, this is a good RPG. Like, the way RPGs are supposed to be. The closest example I can offer might be Fable or maybe Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. Really, the only difference is that you're revived when you die rather than loading a previous save or checkpoint.",1.0

7416,137147417.0,1860510,"Gameplay:

I've been playing this since the pre-ea demo. It's sort of a mix between Total War, Mount & Blade, and Arma. The world map plays like Total War's, but in real time instead of turn based. The battles themselves are a mix between M&B and Arma's Zeus. When playing in RTS mode the game feels more like Zeus, but with dumber yet more obedient AI troops. You have very limited control over your troops on the field, only really being able to control movement, stance, and fire modes. When playing in FPS mode it feels like M&B, but with guns and armored vehicles instead of swords and horses. 

So if you want something like Call To Arms, but with significantly less focus on the RTS side and more focus on the direct control/FPS side then this is it. It's a very basic RTS and an okay FPS. Not COD or Arma, but better than what you get in Call To Arms or Gates Of Hell.

Quality:

The game has come a long way since the release of the pre-ea demo and I enjoy playing it. However, at the current price of $30, I can't really say it's worth it. It lacks content, some of the mechanics still feel very clunky, and there is still quite a bit of bugs. I know the devs are working to improve the game and they do make an effort to implement features suggested by the community which has helped the game improve a lot. The game has gotten better every update and I'm confident that if the devs see this through then it'll be a great game worth the full $30.

However, looking at this from a consumers stand point I can't recommend you buy this game at its full price of $30. The game is just not there yet. For now it's best to wait until the game either improves a lot or at least until it goes on sale in the future.",0.0

7436,137150060.0,1967630,"   So far I've been very addicted to this game since release because it strikes a balance of being a challenge without being overbearing.  Survival elements are always on my mind but not terribly hard to manage just a matter of planning out my trips for resources. As with most survival games progression eases the difficulty for water/food etc. as you get better items. Then added onto their are perks added in as you do things repeatedly aka talents that kick in. Combat takes some skill after repeatedly fighting ""honey badger"" and the birds I haven't tired of it. 

 I would like to address some users on the forums making complaints that puzzle me. The fov of this game is fine... I have the worst motion sickness that's induced very easily,  so far I've played for hours and not felt ill. Time passes as you craft/harvest etc. which is different but it makes time matter rather than just conjuring things into thin air like a wizard. Hence that's why mp/co-op is not really even possible because if that's added it would do away with the time mechanic altogether. 

 Overall I'm really surprised by this game when I purchased it I was expecting a janky typical survival game for the price but was dead wrong. It has a lot of content at 8hrs ingame so far I don't even have a boat constructed as i'm still exploring the first island. Gotta give credit to the developers for answering questions in the forum nice to see them interact with people rather than hiding like some devs do.  Only con is the ""threat nearby"" cannot build anything... I would like to see that done away with as its annoying.",1.0

- a better skills tree / perk system.

- You can construct structures and workstations.

The game features a large, open world with tons of secrets to uncover.  The game reminds me a lot of Green Hell in terms of difficulty as it's a constant battle just to stay alive.  It's probably not for those who enjoy ""casual"" survival games, although I believe you can tune the difficulty to your liking.

As of this writing, I'm only about 20 hours into the game and it seems there is plenty of content left for me to discover.

The early access release has definitely lived up to that expectation so far.  I highly recommend it!",1.0
7439,137147633.0,1967630,"I've only just begun my adventure, but I'm enjoying the survival aspects of the game so far. Having experienced the demo version of this game a few months ago, I had more of an idea going into this as far as expectations. Although there is a lot of room for growth and additional improvements, the developers have shown a lot of promise with this current build.

The Good:
1. Gorgeous environment 
2. Vast landscape with numerous plant and animal species
3. Diverse blueprint and crafting system
4. Basic in-game tutorial

Needs Work:
1. Mapping system - Drawing the map is as simple as climbing one of the larger trees. This action reveals every resource in a given radius and is available for inspection at any time, which really detracts from the overall immersion of a survival game. I think I'd rather have the ability to draw the map from a high point, but manually contribute my own markers as I discover them. This would also require a more diverse variety of custom markers available to the player. 

2. Crafting/Harvesting - I don't want to spend too much time on this as other reviews have discussed it, but the current crafting/harvesting uses a menu system that displays expected resources, craft/harvest time, and tool processing information. You are not swinging your ax to cut down trees, nor are you performing an action to construct your bed of leaves. As the player finishes the action, the weather often drastically changes or you'll be attacked by a roaming venomous critter or other predator as you exit your craft/harvest menu. 

3. Skills - A few skill perks are great and add considerable damage for thrown weapons. Other perks reduce the chance for injury during cooking by an additional 1%. I'd rather see perks that may increase the chance for a higher quality food item as you level your cooking skill. The Point Perks (PP) task system is a nice implementation, but PP for an acronym? That's literally the best we could do guys? 

4. Flora/Fauna Re-spawn - Every resource operates on a timer, with the average duration being about 30 in-game days. Though I haven't observed a full in-game day, I'd say each day lasts roughly 15 real-time minutes. So, you're playing around 8 hours before coconuts and tree bark grow back. Maybe it hinges on the immersion, or encourages the player to explore other islands. Maybe it's because the short-eared dogs or harpies were on such a short timer in the demo.

There's a few other observations such as locating the majority of stones only in dedicated stone piles, or identifying Liana used for making rope and other tools. I think the description for Liana reads ""can be gathered from Banyans and some bushes."" Like, hey idiot, go find the Banyan. I had to Google what a Banyan was. I think this is where we should actually have a flora/fauna encyclopedia or journal in the Journal tab, where every plant/tree and animal we interact with creates its own page. 

There are a ton of negative reviews complaining about the badger. I do think it's weird that the block and focus/aim action are the same button on controller, but the short-eared dog has a linear attack pattern. Get really good at throwing weapons by practicing on the crabs and you'll be good to go for those 'badgers.'",1.0

7441,137149571.0,1277230,"About 2 to 3 hours of psychological horror and convoluted navigation through the nightmares, if nothing else the visuals were very beautiful (in a disturbing kind of way), but unfortunately, I felt the game recycled some of its ideas a bit too much. It reminds me of a certain game, but I don't want to make a comparison because of the plot similarities, although I don't think the story is all that unique. I figured it was more of a chill walking game, but it actually takes some ideas from the RE1 remake with the knife counter and a few basic weapons. That said, you can dodge most of the enemies, and the game has a checkpoint every 2 minutes or so. There were a few parts that were slightly difficult, the game has a bit of a problem with stun locking (probably intentional),  so getting grabbed next to 2 enemies is a bite rollercoaster. 

I mean, there is not a lot to say about the narrative here if I am being completely honest, you have 3 characters and the game only covers a few locations (one house and a subway inside a nightmare), and as you might guess there is something that happened to the family in the past. I kinda expected it to make some kind of unique twist or change the formula a bit, but the ending was very much exactly what I expected. 
However, I still like all of the detail in the rooms, the game has a lot of background material and various world-building - I was interested in the story, I just wish it was a bit different.

As already mentioned, the design if the scenery is really the best part here, just the coloring and the gore look very satisfying, plus the enemies feel very uncanny and unpleasant to interact with. As far as I can tell only 2 of the 4 regular enemies can be killed, and I didn't particularly like that design choice, you mostly use bullets to stun or give you a bit of room to dodge. The ammo conservation is not a very big part of the experience, the game resets your inventory between the dreams, so it never really felt like I really had to watch my bullets, aside from the last section, you can more or less just walk past the demon babies. 

There are several optional achievements, and if I am not mistaken it seems there are a few hidden events, I accidentally walked into an enemy that seemingly appeared at random in the same location, not sure what that was about. It has some* optional exploration but not really, mostly illusion of exploration, the game wants you to follow a path, with a few extra rooms that don't have much purpose otherwise. I don't recall any puzzles, for the most part you just have to figure out where to go, and it's not always easy because of the ""dream logic"".

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

(+) The visuals were great, everything from various death animations to just the coloring of the rooms and the design of the scenery. Very gory, if you like that it has some interesting moments. 

(+) I thought the atmosphere was not great, but decent enough and I was never really out of the experience, it's just that some unintuitive moments made me ignore the narrative a bit. 

(+) I like all of the attempts at world-building, all of the useless trinkets you can look at. I wanted to follow the story, but in the end, it fees like something we have seen before many times.

[h1] Feedback: [/h1]

[u] Gameplay [/u] - for the puddle monsters, sometimes it was not clear where they are located, I know about the body parts, but in a place with the water sometimes I could not tell, so it felt too much like trial and error.
I am not sure if you really wanted the monsters to stunlock you, even 2 enemies can grab you endlessly. Not a big fan of zombies being immortal. 

On a more subjective note, you went with the Resident Evil Remake combat and elements like ammo conservation, but because of the chapter changes and inventory reset, I felt like that part of the game didn't feel justified, I wish it played a bigger part in the game, maybe more conventional bosses you had to kill and not just run away from.

[u] Controls [/u] - for the keyboard, it would be nice if you could also hotkey all weapons to 1,2,3 as well as whatever you have now, I kinda wanted to map fire to mouse 1 too.

[u] Atmosphere [/u] - I liked the jump scares, but I felt like the first 60 minutes did the same thing as the last 60 minutes. I don't know, perhaps the game needed more slow moments with exploration, and fewer jumps.

[b] Overall Thoughts: 7/10 [/b]

My first impression was very good, I think it's a very good-looking horror game and I wish the combat mechanics had more purpose. Sadly, I just don't think the game did anything interesting with the narrative, I didn't mind the characters but for me, I think this is exactly the kind of plot you don't want to do, we have seen something similar so much over the years, I need something a little different. The game was priced a bit lower than I expected, so taking that into consideration, it's not bad, but it won't be a very memorable game for me.

At 17 hrs in, i'm still not halfway through the story as I squirrel a lot, but that's not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion. You are meant to explore in this game. 

I've never felt the ""it's a walking game"". No matter what I was doing, it felt like I was moving forward. Going back to previous places was refreshing as the world areas change as you progress through the game, sometimes in interesting ways. Eventually you'll unlock quick travel points which will help with the world traversal.

The combat takes a little getting used to, and the camera angles are sometimes a hindrance to the flow of the fight, but it was never a game stopper for me. There is a good selection of weaponry to choose from and I found that some suited me better than others, and it also depended on what I was fighting. 

Crafting is simple, nothing too complicated. Resources are a little hard to come by early on, but if you explore you'll soon have more than enough for whatever you may need.

For starters, the game isn't very deep or long. You can only make maybe 10, 15 foods? And the amount of objects to choose from for adding to your restaurant are slim, and sometimes don't match with anything. For example, there's a bit modern rectangular window, but no modern doorways that match it. Some tables and chairs don't match anything, either. There's also only 2 bar options and I think 4 barstool options, but the barstools are all functionally the same in terms of their decor value save for 1. The bars basically seem pointless to have in terms of decor efficiency, honestly.

Simplicity isn't a bad thing, however. But it is reflective of the game's longevity, which isn't much. After you finish the scenarios, which for me took 12 hours but for someone else may take more or less time, there's not much else to do. There's a sandbox mode, but you experienced everything that the game has to offer in the scenarios, and there's not really any amazing building options to want to farm for a super awesome looking restaurant. Decorations are few and far between.

This all sounds negative of me to say, so why would I recommend it? Simply put, I got it on sale, and I had fun with those 12 hours. Despite the flaws, it's still got a good core to it. It's just that it leaves me wanting more.

7465,137152203.0,1537830,"This is a really good kart racer. Like, REALLY good. CTR Nitro-Fueled/Mario Kart 8 good.

So, what I like:
- Currently the in-game shop uses currency that is only obtained in-game, so no ""true"" microtransactions (yet).
- Good cast of starting characters, and the developers promise more will be added over time.
- LOTS of activities, game modes, etc. to play.
- Multiplayer has crossplay functionality across all platforms. Finding a full grid of people to race against takes me, on average, 10-20 seconds.
- Music, sound effects, and voices are really, really nice.
- The core gameplay is very fast, frantic, and fun. Learning how to maintain your drifts and boosts are essential.
- Track design isn't the best we've seen in a kart racer, but it ranges from average to pretty good.
- Performance is really good! I have everything maxed out on my aging 5-6 year old computer, and the game runs silky smooth. No hiccups at all.
- Powerups aren't super varied, but enough to keep them interesting.

What I DON'T like so far:
- Battle pass feels like it's going to be pretty slow to progress through.
- Character graphics are a step down from everything else in the game. Mickey's ears aren't even fully rounded. I mean, the models ARE decent enough, but they could have been better.
- Gacha/loot box mechanics when opening boxes from the store make it harder to unlock specific characters, crew members, etc.
- It's advertised as free to play, but this is not the case (at least on Steam). You need to purchase a bundle that includes a founder pack, the cheapest is $30. Still relatively cheap if you go for that bundle, but advertising it as free to play feels very misleading.
- Shop is set-up in a way that definitely alludes to spending real money eventually when (not if) they add this to the game.
- The game is very grindy. Unlocking new characters and such will take a good amount of time. Casual players will probably never have the full roster unlocked, especially when we inevitably get additional characters added over time.

Overall, the core gameplay is what definitely keeps this as a thumbs up in my review. The cons aren't deal breakers at all, and it's encouraging that (at this time) there's no way to spend real money in the in-game shop. As long as you're not too bothered by the grind, there's a lot to do in this game so far and I'm sure it'll probably a blast to play with your fellow kart racer loving friends. As a whole, considering this is listed as early access, the game's currently looking and playing very good!",1.0

Excellent: The UI is smooth and intuitive, with just enough details from visual cues and most things are clickable for full details.  Building rooms, assigning teams is all very natural and easy.

Good: The core game cycle is very good for first contact of each world.  Build up power reserves to connect to more distant worlds, send a team through, return with research samples.

Poor: It feels extremely constricting to have access to a dozen worlds worth of raw resources and new tech but not be able to pay for my 8 employees more than a year before bankruptcy.  Forget about having more than 2 teams.  Forget about having guards and scientists just working at the base.  Forget about patents that last more than 12 months.  The tech tree is extremely basic, but since each world can be visited only once, and research comes only from these visits, you MUST unlock the tech tree in precisely the correct order or you can forget about unlocking next worlds which give access to next research.

Demands: For a game like this I want pages of tech tree for skills, items, weapons, marginal improvements everywhere - both for the gaters and the base's industries.  Similarly I should be able to send teams to worlds repeatedly, even if for diminishing returns, to keep myself from getting hard locked from advancement.  The recurring engineer missions for ore are great, I need this for scientists (remote labs), soldiers, traders, etc.  And most urgently, I need economic balancing.  Money should not be a limiting force once exploitation of dozens of worlds is underway - at least let me hire 1 extra guard for the base without bankruptcy.  And patents need to last longer - 12 months is just not enough time for the amount of work that goes into creating them.  I'm combining novel research from 5 alien worlds into this single tech, dammit and it should pay more than 1 soldier's wages for a year when it takes 6 scientists working around the clock under threat of death for a year to produce it.

Suggestions: not every world needs a story, but every world does need multiple, unique things about it (flora, fauna, physics, whatever).  As such I really want encyclopedias (even if just lists) of creatures and plants, ideally that I can also put on display or collect.  When I assign someone to a team, their shirt should be the color of the team for easy identification.  The thought bubbles should have a legend since they're so critical.  I should be able to research toward different types and sizes of teams, and different equipment to add to the team (robotic pack animals, etc) as ways of ""leveling up"" the team rather than just more experience for each member (yes I know about training rooms, but everyone has to be working near full-time gathering specimens to have any hope of enough patents for next months payroll).  There should be earth based events and storyline.  There should be more researchable gate defenses.  Gate research should unlock wider areas of planets, not just ""more power, argh argh argh.""  And maybe, just maybe, I could build bases on the other end of stargates that have been claimed with their own mining and research capabilities and staff.

What happens when you take a platformer, base building, stealth, rouguelike and add cute 8 bit gameplay?

You get possibly one of the best games ever made, Mr. Sun's Hatbox. Holy hell guys I am not joking when I say that this quite literally combines all my favorite parts of niche indie games and meshes it into a big fun mess. If you were here for the review & wanted to know whether or not you should get it? It's a definite MUST and in my honest opinion a strong contender for MY Game of the Year. But if you want to know why, keep watching.



//graphics, sound & artstyle//

While the 8 Bit style of yesteryear has worn its welcome, Mr Sun's Hatbox is elevated by it. Accompanied by the wonderful sfx of the entire world & the music, it's simply spectacular. As a sidenote, a lot of the little helpers you get have quirks- some of them may be deaf or hard of hearing, the way the game changes while you're controlling them, whether muffled sounds or no sound at all deserves some recognition


//Gameplay//

You are part of the most elite delivery service in the world, so DEFINITELY not FedEx.. and while delivering a hat to Mr. Sun, some ruffians steal the package. It's up to you to intercept that package right back (as he did have insurance on that). You start by setting up a base of operations, a mission control panel, staff room, storage, medbay and brig to... brainwash people you kidnap into joining your cause... Missions are scanned in the world, and their difficulty level and what you will be doing for example, killing a target, kidnapping them, surviving a raid, delivering a package, stealing a package, etc etc. You send a worker to a mission PERMADEATH IS ALWAYS ON (can be switched off but so will achievements be in the menu) so be careful, you are given balloons that will send gear, hats & enemies back to your base, upon completing missions your workers will gain exp and the reward advertised. With leveling up, your worker CAN lose bad quirks.

The ultimate objective is to get Mr. Sun's hat back by any means necessary, that will mean later on, opening up a black market, building research facilities, building facilities among other great helps. Eventually you will even be able to build a lab that can add and take quirks away!




//Price//

14.99 USD




//How Many Hours Estimated//
 
Alright, I'm about 3/5 done with the story (what I believe) and i'm 8 hours in. Doing it completely single player BUT also, once I'm done- my partner & myself are going in it HARD cause it's got co-op. I'm estimating I'm gonna do at least 50 hours.


//Is it SteamDeck Playable?//

Yep! It is, although the control of guns feel a little weird, I still COULD play it just as I can on my computer.


//Final Thoughts//



This is THE Indie Game. So much brutality and such cuteness all combined so perfectly. Mr. Sun's Hatbox as aforementioned is a game that I feel could be my Game of the Year, I've been having so much fun just going into missions and getting money to upgrade my facilities, brainwashing guys I think could be useful and even came up with this cool little exploit where I buy whatever the Black Market has for 50% off and then sell it at my store for full price. It seemed really easy at first but BOY was I wrong, I kept getting my a** kicked and at one point I didn't even notice but it was the same guy molly whooping me. Ole Shade Bray, his little b* a**, taking two of my guys- I was finally gonna be able to exact revenge on him.. sending my Gunbye Steele into battle and offing him was TOO satisfying. However, later on Gunbye Steele was kidnapped and when I did a mission to retrieve him, I accidentally blew him up while fighting to get him out... Nemesis System is something I did not expect to have while playing this, but man has it made such a resounding impact on my current gameplay. I'm having so much fun with this and I since the beginning like I said, just go ahead and buy it. Guns, hats, cute little psychopaths, this game has it all. 

I didn't even mention that you could rename them but I feel like every time I did, it was like putting the dagger in their last little heart. 

And as far as complaints go? I really have none. Each hat has it's own purpose, even if some don't you'll be using them for research later or contracts on the black market. It's fast, and rewarding and most of all a ton of fun. i can't wait to dive back into it and get lost for another few hours.

7483,137151237.0,1434540,"I just started playing Zoeti and I'm really enjoying it so far! The art and character designs are amazing, and the soundtrack fits perfectly with the overall bright atmosphere of the game. I'm not much of a story person, so I tend to skip dialogues, but I can tell that there's a lot of lore and interesting characters in this game.

The mechanics of Zoeti are what really drew me in. At first, I thought it was similar to Slay the Spire, but as I continued playing, I found Zoeti to be more engaging for me. You quickly realize that using your abilities is not entirely reliant on the individual cards you draw, but require you to have poker hands. This adds an extra layer of depth that I was surprised to encounter.

Unfortunately for me, I knew nothing about poker so I had to take some time to get familiar with poker hands. Once I got a grasp on them, that's when the fun really began.

I will admit that I had some trouble trying to understand some of the combat mechanics as it pertains to debuffs, buffs, and trying to understand everything in order to make more informed decisions on what abilities to pick up. It took me some time to understand things like ""poison"", ""gash"", and ""bite"" as they do damage every turn but in different ways. Despite this difficulty, I was able to get a better understanding with every failure and I'm really looking forward to when I'll be able to successfully make it to the end of the run.",1.0

7485,137151424.0,2321210,"For hitting early access a few days ago, Neon Echo is surprisingly fleshed out and some aspects are incredibly polished. There are certainly rough edges to be found, but this could have been sold as is and you'd still easily get 30+ hours of roguelite fun. Keeping in mind that I haven't beat the second boss yet, (I haven't seen the third map/boss and one of the characters,) let's get into my experience with the game:

Positives:
• Fast and fluid combat that's fun to execute
• Fantastic visuals full of color and character
• Memorable character designs and personalities, particularly for the playable characters that are always on-screen
• The two characters I've played (Lilya and Evelyn) are uniquely strong with fun playstyles
• Tempo Skills (using your skill on the correct beat to power it up) are a ton of fun to use, both intentionally and on accident
• A slow but steady pace of permanent upgrades to continually work on
• A healthy variety of mid-run upgrades spanning 5+ systems that can all synergize
• Rhapsody deserves a special shoutout for being a really fun way to mix up and direct your build
• Turbulent stages focused on dodging traps and hitting targets that are a good change of pace
• Difficulty that encourages personal improvement as you progressively unlock permanent upgrades

Negatives:
• The English voice acting is awful. A handful characters are unbearable to listen to, occasionally words are mispronounced or differ from the captions, some one-liners don't make sense even in context, (like ""Great cooperation!"") and while it's good for a laugh here and there it detracts from the experience overall
• Music variety is almost nonexistent right now; I've already gotten tired of the first map's theme 6 hours in. This is bound to improve as updates come out though
• While stage layouts barely pass IMO, they're currently weak. Maybe it gets better in the third act, but it's very clear there's a greater map structure that gets cut up for the short stage segments. Sometimes this makes navigation a little confusing with inaccessible areas jutting into your path, other times it serves to enhance the feeling of being a small cog of the massive machine of everything going on in the world. It would be a little better if the barriers to inaccessible zones blended with the walls. At least the short segments and sheer variety don't let you memorize individual layouts, so navigation doesn't feel stale
• The Rhythm Launchpad system feels cruel at worst and underutilized at best. It definitely plays more into the longer runs I haven't gotten into yet, but it doesn't feel like there's enough music core rewards and needing to get the right colors for your build further limits the value you can get out of it. There's also a limit to how many cores you can use, so even if you're lucky enough to get all the cores you want you'll only be able to slot a few of them in. As if that wasn't enough, the randomization of slot and column/row effects means you will almost never get a cohesive benefit from the launchpad; just a few stat increases that often don't mesh with your build. And some of the effects are literal nerfs (looking at you Omni-Damage -40%)
• Stage reward options aren't real choices most of the time. Despite having an entire system for picking them, usually there's literally only one option. And when a choice is actually presented it's often between currency for a future permanent upgrade and temporary run upgrade, which once again isn't really a choice; until you've exhausted the permanent upgrades they should be prioritized every time
• The cooldown indicator for Neonflash, your counter, is tied to your dash. Which makes sense but means you can't see if it's available mid-dash (and the color difference is hard to make out in the heat of combat). A (neon?) visual indicator on the character would be way better but isn't present currently
• Despite taking place in a world where music empowers humanity to fight, only one mechanic in the entire game revolves around listening to the game's music (and is undercut by a visual indicator). Hopefully more gets tied into the music later on
• The visual beat indicator for Tempo Skills is at the bottom of the screen, so you have to look away from the action to know if you can use it; which is extra frustrating because the audio indication is almost indistinguishable from normal beats. As a result the coolest part of regular combat is mostly done on accident
• For how long it takes to charge your ultimate, it doesn't feel impactful to use. Don't get me wrong the visual impact is insane, (please make ult damage show up in neon on healthbars!) but in terms of gameplay you're lucky if it kills something that a couple basic attacks or Tempo Skill wouldn't have. And since there's no way to upgrade your ultimate it will always feel disappointing to use; though I guess it's useful as a panic button for a little bit of invincibility
• I can't speak for the 3rd boss and this could definitely be a skill issue, but both Lahaire and Rakan are hard to read compared to normal enemies until you've learned their patterns; which combined with significantly larger attack areas makes dodges and Neonflashes against them very difficult. With Rakan being a limbless snake this is especially pronounced, (which must be why it is the only enemy with bright red attack indicators,) but so far I can only attribute my success against the bosses to build choice and luck
• There's no consistent way to attack above you, which makes airborne combat frustrating. Especially if the enemy is on a ledge slightly above you, I can't tell you how many times I've missed an enemy right in front of me because it's slightly elevated (making my attack get eaten by the ledge)
• This is the tiniest issue ever, but you can't interact with some things for a brief period after dashing/jumping. I probably lost 2 minutes of my 6 hours waiting for an invisible cooldown so I could grab the stage rewards

TL;DR - The game is already good fun with a lot of polish in the visuals, long-term progression, and moment-to-moment combat. Some mechanics are weak/poorly done right now, and the English dub is absolutely atrocious, but there's plenty of time for things to improve. Definitely worth the money in its current state, especially after an update or two have come out.",1.0
7486,137152565.0,1669980,"Very cute, played through one time at about ~6 hours and absolutely cried at the end. I currently have no intention to play again because the game left me feeling wholly satisfied with how things wrapped up, and I personally believe that to be a big plus. Totally worth the $10.

Translation is rough in some spots but not bad enough to affect my enjoyment, and the only bug I encountered was the (often reported) issue where sometimes when you click on a letter the game softlocks. Luckily exiting the game, reloading the autosave at the start of the day, and simply ignoring the letters let me keep playing, but still an inconvenience that needs to be fixed.

All in all, lovely experience. It's very pretty and the different ways you can choose to progress kept things feeling fairly interesting. There's a lot of stuff and a lot of alternate endings, so if you're the kind of person who wants to grind those out you'll have a good time.

I recommend it if you're looking for an opportunity to build your knowledge of trading, technical analysis, chart, entry & exit skills from scratch. It's also a fun time-filler if you enjoy trading.

What to expect? You trade candlestick charts of historical data of stocks listed on US. stock exchanges. The mystery stocks are revealed to you only after you've traded them for a period of time. You trade with virtual money and if you're good, you should be able to grow your net worth over time. You also grow your capital by learning about various stock market & trading related concepts such as Moving Averages, Margin Loans and so on. The game starts you up with a Margin Loan which you need to invest, safeguard and build, or you run the risk of a Margin Call that ends your campaign run. The deeper you get into the campaign, your capital and technical analysis tool kit expands to include moving averages, MACD, volume and so on. You'll also unlock ETFs and crypto.
 
I've been looking for a simulation like this one for a while now. I found this through another influential day trader who mentioned it on their newsletter. I do think it can help you sharpen your skills, thought-process and trading discipline a bit. This is where the game shines. However, it's training utility drops sharply if you've already passed a day-trader beginner stage. For instance, if you've been relying on an IRL day-trading setup (indicators, trade & risk management), don't expect to be able to extend that setup to this simulation. Here you start from scratch and have limited technical customisation abilities. Ofc this is absolutely fair and I'm only mentioning this because I'd hope this review would help clarify what to expect.  

In a nutshell, the intended target audience for the simulation are beginners. It's still fun to struggle with spotting and profiting from market cycles, huge price breakouts, building your net worth over time only to have to deal with the very real emotions having it disintegrate when markets crash.

Game length


About game length, I cleared it on the hardest difficulty in 17h according to Steam, 13h according to the game. Sure you could get another game that is longer but... don't you think it's about quality and not quantity?.

7506,137154518.0,1681060,"This game has a great idea, and it has promise, but it just makes no sense. You have to use research gained from other planets to... learn how to install treadmills? How to hire soldiers? How to set up a rec room? 90% of the research is just things you should know how to build initially. Sure, it's a game, and it's a game progression system, but it absolutely breaks immersion.

The economy is a mess as well. You simply cannot survive if you hire for more than minimum wage. What is this, late stage capitalism? We live this already, we don't need to play a game revolving around it. What's the point of having higher wage employees if you can't afford them? You only get so much from patents, and [spoiler] the committee drops your funding right when you need it most. [/spoiler] The fact that you can't revisit planets for more research samples is another example of game systems trumping common sense. Planets are BIG. You mean to tell me that if you go to the same planet a second time, you're not going to find anything that might be of commercial value? Instead, you're constantly in a race to expand, with more and more demands on your income, and the constant threat of dwindling income that will doom your run.

All in all, you spend more time trying to nickel and dime your way through the greatest scientific discovery known to man than you do exploring, or having fun. If I wanted to see mankind squander the wonders of science for profit, I'd watch the news. There are a lot of little QoL issues as well, but I expect those will be ironed out (I'm looking at you, guard posts and invasions).

7512,137154452.0,1621990,"Stray Blade comes off to me as a marriage of Kingdom of Amalur's world and design, and a mild version of Souls' combat mechanics.  

Visually, the game looks really good. Despite its more toon like appearance, they did polish it really well. The environment is large, colorful, and sometimes hazardous. Characters/enemies have unique designs, I haven't seen any rinse and repeat so far. Nothing ground breaking, but I'll take a solid design over being the next best thing.  Audio is solid. The ambient sounds is relaxing, decent voice acting, and overall in game chatter is fun.

Combat has a risk & reward setup similar to the Souls games. I don't think its anywhere near as unforgiving, but I do believe you Souls guys would still enjoy. You have your standard light/heavy attacks, dodge, parry/block, and ultimate attacks. You have the ability to lock-on to focus on a desired target. Enemies will glow according to what type of attack is coming next, which you have to decide on a dodge or parry at that moment. There's also a stun meter, which can stagger an enemy, giving you a window to unleash some free attacks. However, you're governed by a meter that's a resource for attacking and defensive maneuvers, so duel with caution. Upon death, you're treated to a revive at the last checkpoint you visited, with a little help from Boji. Weapons feel weighted accordingly, each with their own abilities and properties. You grow your character via skill trees, which you acquire points for as you level.  Equipment is also upgradeable, craftable, and can receive modifications to suit your needs. 

Stray Blade comes off to me as a marriage of Kingdom of Amalur's world and design, and a mild version of Souls' combat mechanics.  Don't come here expecting the next best Souls game or a ground breaking entry. Story seems pretty standard, but I'm OK with that, seeing as the game focuses on it's combat and character management. If you're looking for something that's fun and challenging, give it a shot.

7529,137153054.0,2299620,"***Public Service Announcement***  Always take a few minutes to recommend/review games you enjoy, it helps more than you know!  Also, important and relevant...if you write a negative review and the developer immediately fixes your issue and responds as such, maybe fix your review?  As much as positive reviews are incredibly important, negative reviews (especially silly ones or legit ones that have been addressed/fixed) are horribly damaging.

I've only spent a little bit of time with the game at this point, but from what I've experienced thus far, it has been enjoyable.  The opening of the game with the foundation of the story is laid out fairly quickly and you get right into character creation for up to 5 party members.  There are a surprising amount of classes to choose from to allow you to form a group that fits your play style best.  It also gives you multiple options to try on subsequent playthroughs if you so wish.  

After character creation you are essentially allowed to spend your meager starting funds and then head off to the ""Core"" or dungeon.  Depending on how long you spend in character creation, you can get to the action within just a few minutes.  There IS a tutorial section you can look at from the menu that gives you A LOT of info and can explain things in much more detail, but it doesn't force this upon you.  I appreciate either way of doing things, but many folks hate forced tutorials and the developer opted to provide the info only if you want it.  So, for the more impatient among us, you can get right into the action!

You have a mini-map that fills in as you explore, you are in a first person view, as you tend to be in most dungeon crawlers, and you have a ""danger indicator"" in the bottom right.  The more you move and explore, the more you attract baddies.  Combat is what you would expect as well with all very easy to understand mechanics and things working how you would expect.  Again, basing this off the short time I've played, it's just a solid dungeon crawler all around.  

There are a few small things that don't matter and (I assume are easy enough to fix) that I've run into.  Letters being slightly misaligned when inputting a name, not being able to use the keyboard to just type in a name, my controller not being supported/working.  Again, none of these things are a big deal and, short of the controller thing, they can probably be easily fixed if it's worth the effort.  It literally  might be JUST me that has these slight issues and, as I said, they are tiny and don't matter.  The keyboard controls work very well, so the controller thing isn't much of an issue.  Plus, I use a PS5 controller, which tends to be the problem child of controllers.  :)

Steam tends to not count reviews when you have received a product for free, and often times people will also assume we will only say good things.  The developer specifically said they would appreciate any feedback I could give and that I tell them ""...what you honestly think.""  I do tend to be more positive than most, because I prefer to enjoy things and focus on what works and what is good with a game.  At the end of the day, am I enjoying my time playing Core Crossing?  Yes.  Does it present itself properly and live up to that?  So far, absolutely.  Will I continue to play?  Yes, if time permits.

So, if you're in the market for a dungeon crawler from a developer who is throwing their heart and soul into making dungeon crawlers, for the time being (who knows what the future holds), you definitely should give NANKADA and Core Crossing a chance.  They already have one out, Advent Crossroad (which I was told will be getting a big update soon) and there's a third on the way.  I also recommend you check out some gameplay of the game yourself.  It doesn't have to be my channel, but it does tend to be one of the final steps I myself take before purchasing a game.  

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a team to lead through a core and some trials.",1.0

It has a similar sort of uncanniness to things like Shin Megami Tensei and things like that. The mystery of the nature of the tower, the characters, and Paradise are compelling. There are some nice character moments that dovetail with the metaprogression, and you do get to care for the little children that climb down the tower.

Gameplay-wise, pretty simple, and maybe too simple for dedicated fans of the card-battling genre. Most enemies have varied gimmicks that you have to learn to exploit, and on deeper floors especially you can't just brute force your way through. But I think there are too few random events and enemy types, at least as far as I've gotten, making runs feel a bit too samey. The real variety comes from your team and their loadout, but you'll always want to, for example, keep one fire card on you at all times because you'll probably get an event that needs one. I want this game to be chunkier than it is.

7541,137156303.0,1922960,"Although this game is similar to older dungeon crawlers, the implementation is very smooth and modern. The game at 1920 x 1080 resolution.

My only two concerns were stat downgrades when you level up and lack of class-specific item drops. The stat drops are rare when leveling up. It can be hard to find class-specific loot, because the shop only stocks basic stuff. Everything else is very modern and quick. Inventory management is good. Moving through the dungeons and the menus is very fast, especially if you use ""short"" confirm dialogs. People say that unlocking chests is slow, but it takes about 10 seconds to work through them.

I was able to roll up 6 custom characters with bonuses of 20+ in about an hour. So far, there is minimal grinding. I just got to the third labyrinth after about 4.5 hours of play, and my understanding is that there are about 8 labyrinths total. I expect the later ones to be more lengthy and challenging. I highly recommend the game to fans of party grid-movement turn-based combat first-person dungeon crawlers.

It's very unique & surprisingly complex with fantastic amounts of creativity involved. The parry system doe not require absolute pinpoint timing like most games - although I feel the parry animation it cuts to with every parry is totally unnecessary. 

My only gripe is the voice acting - it's VERY annoying (from the full on scripted bits to the in game vocal sounds when you parry or whatever) & I'd be fine with just text or that sort of muffled gibberish you cant make any words out from.

7550,137156466.0,2356350,"I recently picked up Grand War: Rome, a turn-based strategy game set in the fascinating and rich history of ancient Rome. After spending several hours delving into its immersive world, I'm excited to share my thoughts on this exciting game.

First and foremost, the game's strategic elements are incredibly well-designed. Each turn presents the player with a variety of meaningful choices and decisions that significantly impact the outcome of battles. The balance between managing your military, economy keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging throughout.

One aspect of Grand War: Rome that truly stands out is the smoothness of the gameplay. Transitions between turns and various menus are seamless, and I have yet to experience any performance issues or crashes. 

Another praiseworthy aspect of the game is its attention to historical accuracy. As an enthusiast of Roman history, I was delighted to see that the game's world is rich with accurate representations of figures, events, and locations. This level of detail adds depth to the experience and makes it all the more enjoyable for history buffs like myself.

That being said, there is one area where Grand War: Rome falls a bit short: the user interface (UI). While the UI is functional, it feels somewhat clunky and unintuitive at times. Navigating through menus and accessing certain features can be cumbersome, which detracts from the overall experience. I believe that with some tweaks and refinements, the UI could be vastly improved, elevating the game to new heights.

In conclusion, Grand War: Rome is a highly enjoyable turn-based strategy game that excels in its smooth gameplay, well-designed strategy mechanics, and historical accuracy. However, the game's UI could use some polishing to truly make it shine. Despite this shortcoming, I would still highly recommend Grand War: Rome to fans of the genre and anyone with an interest in Roman history. With some UI improvements, this game has the potential to become a classic in the turn-based strategy world.

However, I couldn't help but notice that the game is missing some crucial options that I've come to expect from similar titles, particularly when it comes to local multiplayer and accessibility for friends who don't own VR headsets.

I discovered that this issue had been raised in a 2022 discussion thread, but unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be on the developers' official roadmap yet. I sincerely hope they will consider implementing features like Remote Play Together, Parsec, or even a buddy/friend pass system in the future, as it would make it so much easier for me and my friends to enjoy this game together. As of now, it's difficult for me to ask my friends to invest in a game that they can only play with me since they aren't VR owners themselves.

Another aspect that I found disappointing is the lack of a single-player mode and the relatively small player base (the developers' official roadmap does indicate the implementation of a training area and AI in the future though). That said, I was pleasantly surprised to find a thriving Discord community of players eager to join in the fun.

In its current state, I'm considering refunding VR TRIBES and waiting for improvements before giving it another shot.

Review by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34633003-Gaming-Masterpieces/lists/] Gaming Masterpieces [/url]  - The greatest games of all time on Steam. 
[/th][/table]

Is this game a masterpiece? Yes. Unless you hate League of Legends, then maybe not. Apart from that, it is a very well produced action-adventure set in the League of Legends universe. I never really enjoyed the original MOBA, but I have to say that the animated series was really good, and the turn-based Ruined King: A League of Legends Story rpg wasn't bad either. The Hextech Mayhem runner wasn't my taste, but this is because I don't enjoy the genre and not because it is a bad game. Back to Mageseeker. Mageseekers? These are people who seek mages to imprison them. Mages are not liked in the city of Demetia. We play Sylus, a guy with magical abilities who once was a mageseeker, but then got imprisoned and tortured by them and now hates mageseekers with all of his heart. After 15 years of prison, you escape and start a rebellion, free other imprisoned mages, torch the city and... get defeated by a knight. Only your old mentor saves you, and you have to flee the city. While the king was killed during the uprising, his son is still alive and the mageseekers, lead by the unscrupulous Lord Eldred, are under his command. After having escaped to the forest, you meet Leilani, who takes you to a well-hidden camp of escaped mages who want to fight the mageseekers. This becomes our new base where we return between the missions, talk with our allies, plan the next mission, select mages to help us on a mission and which grows and improves during the game (with our help). Quite cool.

You walk along (often spreading) paths, and when enemies appear the area becomes enclosed until you kill everyone, then you can continue. Healing potions restore your health, you can dash, and you can attack enemies. Plays like Hades so far. But you also know magical stuff, you are a mage after all. One of your abilities is to copy magical abilities of your enemies. You steal their powers, at least for one-time use. Quite cool. There are six types of elemental magic, and magic users take extra damage from their opposing element. Normal magic spells use mana, which is regenerated by dealing physical damage to enemies. You learn new spells by first copying them from an enemy, and later you can reproduce them in the camp if you have the required ressources. You can also throw a metal chain and pull yourself directly to an enemy, or use the chain to pull you to an object. This is often used to traverse an abyss, when dashing does not reach far enough. Little birds can be freed (collectibles), treasure is often hidden a little away from the main path. You can always use a map. New game mechanics are introduced along the game, the game starts out rather simple but soon does get a bit more complex and diversified.

Fights are soon against hordes composed of various enemy types, so you need to decide whom to attack first, you need to decide how to attack single foes, you need to evade their attacks. It gets rather difficult when mages cast their various projectiles at you, some very fast and well aimed, others with homing capabilities, when crossbows fly at you, soldiers slash at you and heavily armored mage-fighters cast their spells and attack you with their swords. Dashing, switching spells, using healing powers, stealing spells from mages, using chains to catch far away enemies, attacking fast with light attacks or slow with heavy attacks (which is the only way to destroy enemy armor) does keep you occupied. You can always cancel a mission and return to your base if you don't succeed. There are main missions and secondary missions which just provide rewards to improve your character (or the base). At the base, you can soon improve your character and see his stats for attack, defense, attack damage, magic damage, power ups, mana.

The game saves only at checkpoints. When you die, you just continue shortly before you died, there is no harsh punishment for failing. You can choose between three difficulty settings. Controllers are supported. Ultrawidescreen is not really supported, 2560x1440 is the highest resolution. 3440x1440 is displayed not with black borders, but stretched. Cloud saves work fine. While the pixel art looks fantastic, there are no voice-overs.

7579,137158827.0,1918970,"Eresys - A horror survival coop Lovecraftian themed game has the potential to be a thrilling and terrifying gaming experience for players who enjoy this genre. Lovecraftian horror often involves eldritch creatures, cosmic horror, and the psychological breakdown of characters, which can create a tense and unsettling atmosphere.

In a cooperative game, players could work together to navigate the dark and foreboding world of Lovecraftian horror. Each player could take on a unique role, such as a detective, scientist, or occultist, and bring their own skills and abilities to the team.

The game could also incorporate elements of survival horror, such as resource management and limited ammunition, to create a sense of vulnerability and tension. The Lovecraftian setting could provide a variety of terrifying creatures and environments for players to encounter and overcome, making teamwork and strategic planning crucial to survival.

Overall, Eresys has the potential to be an exciting and immersive gaming experience for fans of horror and Lovecraftian fiction.",1.0

-gunplay is really good since it really low budgut game

Cons:
-Lack of game mode. You only have few of them. Team Deathmatch, Free-For-All Deathmatch, Combat Master, Gun-Game, And Search and Destroy (in my opinion Search and Destroy is the best game mode)
-""Combat Master"" game mode is like battle royale but much worse. You have 6 player in the match if you die 3 time its game over the ammo are just did not exist. Worst game mode in my life.
-It feels like I was playing unfinish product.

- 7/10 - somewhat entertaining to play through, but feels like it lacks depth. In that sense it's similar to MC Dungeons.
- I think the content in the game is well polished, but the amount of content/variety just isn't much.
- The concept is unique enough and there's not much competition in its genre, so that alone can make it worth trying out.
- Comparing to pricing of many other games, I'd be perfectly happy about my purchase if this was 20€ and I expected a 20€ game, but 40€ is questionable. 
- Many reviews compare the game to ""other RTS games"", but it's really just not an RTS. Don't expect to play this like Starcraft. At most the description would be like ""...with some RTS elements"".
- If ""action strategy"" was a commonly known genre, this would probably belong in it.

I'll keep my thoughts on it simple: The game does not screw around, you have a little story tab that gives some (poorly translated) context and some boss cut scenes. But that is your lot.

The second you press play and select your difficulty you are thrown immediately into the game and you gotta figure it out for your own, which for the simplicity and length of the game its alright, if i'm allowed to say it reminds me of touhou in that regard.

7600,137161935.0,2236240,"I just finished playing and I gotta say, it's a pretty cool game. If you're into open-world stuff and like building bases, this one's right up your alley. I played for like 16 hours before unlocking everything. Even though I've finished the game, I'm still having a good time with it.

Some folks might compare it to Project Zomboid 'cause of the isometric view and zombies, but they're actually quite different. Dead Unending is more about base-building and fighting off scavengers, which is super satisfying. And when you get the minigun later in the game, it's just awesome. Also, I heard they're adding co-op mode soon, which sounds pretty sweet.

So yeah, if you're into open-world zombie games with some base-building action, you should definitely give Dead Unending a try. I'm really happy with my purchase, and I'd recommend it to others for sure.",1.0

It can be a bit weird getting used to new areas and enemies at first, but after sometime you get into the flow of things. My only real complaint is that the toxic/floor creep enemies attacks are a bit hard to tell sometimes. Especially if you rack up a lot of bodies in an area and the toxic stuff is right below them.

7617,137165039.0,1730080,"The game is very fun, but I do have some things to say. It lacks some variety, for example the buddy upgrade, you could have multiple different buddies with different attack patterns etc. This applies to other things as well, like bullet upgrades, the ones that exist are fun, but there could be so many more.
The variety aside, one of the biggest problems currently in my opinion is the performance - a pixelated game like this should run quite smoothly on low-end setups, however max i ever got was like 30 FPS. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this game was made with Unity and my guess is that a lot of the performace problems come from dynamic lighting or the particles. However physics operations are also very resource heavy in Unity, so I would look there for the problem. Anyway I think for a game like this it is important to run smoothly on weaker setupds, otherwise you might lose out on a fairly big player base.
The third thing that's been bothering me, is that unlike in Binding of Isaac for example, you hardly have any indication of when you actually do get items, because it's very random. The thing I would personally suggest is that you use chests for loot that is definitely going to contain items and maybe urns for sth that only contain money or bombs or whatever else. On top of that runs are very unbalanced in that sense, because some runs I got an item in almost every chest and others I didn't get a single item for the whole first floor basically.
One other thing is that the game is kind of too short, I beat it in about 5 hours of playtime I believe and there are only 4 floors and all floors kind of have very similar enemies just slightly modified.
In conclusion I do have high hopes for this game to become even better and the downsides aside, it is a very fun game.

The game's problems are basically reduced to small gameplay details for souls like players mainly.
I tried playing on the hardest difficulty and quickly realized that some mechanics needed to be changed.
The game is based on a parry and dodge mechanic. Parry works well but dodging has a very small field which makes it frustrating at times.
Simple mechanics like backstabbing should be immediate death to a single NPC but in this case it relies on a single hit, making stealth mode useless.
The game has a lot of potential and it's a good game once we learn the mechanics, a few simple changes would make the game brilliant.

Steam Support may help if you ask nicely by choosing ‘I have a question about this purchase.’ They say Speedstorm is complimentary with each pack, however, I see no option to play a free version of this on the store page. It only shows free on the receipt. This just seems shady at best on Gameloft’s part. For what it’s worth, the game itself is decently fun, but doesn’t do anything to reinvent the wheel, so to speak. Honestly if you have MarioKart or other good cart racers like I do, maybe just stick to those. This requires prohibitively too much playtime to unlock things, in my opinion. This is a shame too, because I was really looking forward to this game after the beta.

7659,137166939.0,1681060,"For now, i cannot recommend this. The early game (2-3 hours) is fun, then it turns into a slog. The big issue is money, and frankly it's not reassuring that such a critical element just a few hours in isn't noticed by the devs. 

There are broadly 3 sources of income: funding (which runs out after just a year, for some reason), mining, and patents. The most common ore is useless except to sell, but sells for so little that it's barely worth it. You cannot sell the other ores either. This leaves patents. With some luck and planning you can get some good patents that can pay quite well. unfortunately, there are too many categories which vastly dilutes how much theories you have, which greatly reduces the potential value of patents.

The biggest drain on your budget is wages. The system is bizarre: initial pay is what the person will cost, forever. Levelling up does not increase pay. Higher wages employees will have higher stats, but this is a noob trap. Money is the limiting factor, not skills. So you have to hire everyone minimum wage or else you are simply shooting yourself in the foot, not just on the short term but forever. 

The end result of all of this is that you simply softlock at some point. You run out of patents, planets to explore, and mining ore simply cannot sustain your program. The aliens don't actually have to do anything to defeat you: your own budget will. Although again, they represent a significant drain in either soldiers (lvl1 soldiers cannot 1v1 a single alien and the first invasion already features 3. this is absurd. But you also cannot compel anyone to defend or focus fire, so a soldier will run to the canteen to grab some food as the aliens are barging through the gate).

7661,137168259.0,1928870,"It's no Warcraft 3 but it's still fun. It being open world through me off at first but I quickly grew to like it. The world is dynamic with constant piglin expansions and invasions that you can choose to deal with or ignore. There isn't a huge amount of units but they all serve a unique role with none feeling useless. Both the defence and attack gameplay is fun. I remember when I was younger I would build walls and redstone turrets around a village then spawn a load of mobs to create a siege, you can do that for real now. The mission structure is the same for the whole game, destroy 3 bases then fight the boss for each faction. Each faction has completely different base architecture with different weaknesses though so it doesn't feel like you're doing the same thing. My major complaint is the lack of factions which is pretty unheard of for an rts game. Another complaint is the player character does literally 0 damage to high tier enemies, bosses and buildings so all you can do is take out the weaklings while your units do everything important, it especially sucks for boss fights. 3/4 boss fights were boring because you can't do anything yourself. I liked one of the bosses because you have to defend a village from it or you lose. The final boss was just more of the same, spawn a load of units next to it and run around, Not being able to hurt bosses with your sword was a really dumb design choice. People have different attention spans so I can't tell when you will get bored but for me the campaign slightly overstayed its welcome. In the last hour I just wanted it to end.

7668,137166127.0,1698220,"Quite simply, Teslagrad 2 takes all of the elements that made Teslagrad 1 great, and cranks them into overdrive.

The Story: Preserving the same methods of silent storytelling as the original, T2 links T1 and World to the West together to make a seamless cohesive storyline. Seemingly innocuous background art from T1 is given massive significance in T2, and new story elements introduced in T2 are deliberately left a bit vague so they can be expanded in future games. Characters have complex motives which gives them a lot of depth.

The Music: Jørn Lavoll outdoes himself. Fire up the game and listen to the title screen music. Just listen, let it develop. It didn't have to be that good since most people will just spam a button to get to the menus, but what an intro. Many more musical styles are explored here, ranging from heavy metal to jungle to whimsical, with plenty of callbacks to music from T1.

The Gameplay: Movement is much more fluid and rewarding. Blinking, a core ability from T1, is given to you from the very start of T2. Sliding was an ability cut from T1 but brought back in T2, and the levels embrace it in plenty of places, with slopes everywhere to launch from. Simple platforming and very mild puzzles lead up to the first boss, but then the puzzle platforming begins to show its true robustness, with new puzzle elements supported by the new item collectibles. Lots more variety in terrain, and some very-appreciated ""fast-travel checkpoint"" options to get around the much larger map. The boss fights start easy and ramp up to very hard if you're going for all achievements.

This game is a masterpiece. If you liked Teslagrad 1 in any capacity, this is a must-play.",1.0

Only slight comment I'd say is it can feel like whenever you land a melee hit, *you* get hit too; the combination of a hitsound and the screen flashing (with the ammo you just got) makes it seem that even if you struck first and killed them, you're getting hit anyway.

优点：
1，美丽的动态2D背景、细致的CG作画、悠扬的场景BGM，为整个作品创造了特殊的独特氛围感；
2，游戏中设计了相当多数量的子系统，每一个子系统之下又能对应多种不同的反馈机制，无论是人际/探索/养成，皆有独到之处，与其它养成类游戏能拉开足够远的区分度；
3，世界观的设计能明显地看出制作组所花费的心力，游戏的仪轨涉及渗透到了方方面面，完全没有让人出戏的突兀感；
4，程序设计非常稳定，全程没有出现过一次崩溃、跳出、Bug事件。

缺点：
1，女儿在童年时期的时间过短，印象里只有短短数回合，女儿就会进入到青春期，这让玩家的心流节奏有些跟不上；
2，某一些子系统的数值平衡仍然需要进一步打磨，无论是探索战斗，还是人际关系，后期基本上都存在通用解法，多周目游玩不免缺乏足够的随机意外和惊喜；
3，大反派的人物弧光过于突兀，没有成功地说明反派为何之所以是反派，沦为一个脸谱化的存在，游戏最终幕的呈现节奏也过于赶工了。",1.0

7766,137172420.0,1457080,"Up front I'll give it a score of 7/10.  Probably should bump it down to a 6/10 for the bait'n'switch they pull in a sidequest, but I'll get to that in the spoiler section.  Combat's fun for the most part, but there is one fatal flaw that absolutely killed it for me.

For starters: a lot of people thought this was going to be a roguelite/rogue-like. It is neither, it's a straight-up linear progression story. In terms of gameplay it's like a cross between the old God of War games and an arcade beat'em up (Streets of Rage, Ninja Turtles, Final Fight, etc). In between levels you wander around camp, talk to people, put points into your upgrades, then start up the next level.

Combat was fun with a fair amount of options in terms of abilities. As those familiar with Sylas from LoL would expect, a key mechanic is stealing spells off of your enemies. Once you've stolen a spell you can unlock it as an equipable spell. While stolen spells are used for free, when you're holding a stolen spell you don't have access to your equipped spells so you have to use the stolen one first. Equipped spells use mana. Your mana bar has up to 4 pips, and each spell costs a different number of pips. Mana is rebuilt by doing regular and strong attacks, strong attacks restoring more.

So you can find your favorite spells and equip them, but you're by no means a spell-spammer. Most of the best spells in the game cost 3 pips, and regaining pips takes a fair amount of physical attacking. With regards to melee combat: as you progress through the game you'll unlock members of a band of ""outlaws."" These are basically equipable people that increase your damage of a certain type and give you a combo with that type as well. Like the ice guy lets you do a light > light > light > strong combo where the strong leaves a frost AoE puddle that's a DoT.

Also of note is you can use his chains to yank yourself to enemies from a pretty fair distance. Part of my bread'n'butter combo involved this with a wind kick.

So there's plenty to work with in terms of making a build to fit your playstyle. Early-ish in the game you get a spell that gives you a small amount of shield hp for 3 mana pips, and that was pretty much what I spent most of my mana on. Speaking of sustain: you also get a potion with 3 charges that can be upgraded for a 4th, and towards the end of the game you unlock Guardian Angel which gives you one revive per level. I never had it proc so I don't know how much it revives you for, it doesn't say.

As for the one thing that absolutely killed it for me: movement.  It can feel absolutely terrible at times, particularly due to the fact that you can't dash through obstacles.  Not only does this mean it's particularly easy for the enemy to corner you, but it also means that you'll get periodically stuck on random crap like an indestructible stool sitting on the floor.  For a game that's based on rapid-pace action, taking a few hits because Sylas caught his foot on a chair gets pretty frustrating.

~~~Now for some spoilers, stop reading if you don't want to know what champs show up~~~

Champs that appear in the game include...
[spoiler]-Sylas (Obviously)
-Lux
-Garen
-J4
-Shyvana
-Morgana (she fights you as a test of strength before giving you her blessing)
-Kayle kinda-sort but not really
-Nocturne***
***It's just a 3 second cameo.  You're on a sidequest to hunt down something dangerous in the forest that seems to be playing on your fears.  Turns out it's Nocturne who ""fights"" you, but it's just a repeat of the Morgana fight.  After you win she turns into Nocturne who you see just long enough for him to laugh at you and disappear.  As I mentioned, this bait'n'switch was almost enough to knock the game down to a 6/10 for me because I thought a Nocturne fight would have been awesome.  But no, just reuse an old fight, have Nocturne flip us the bird, then he buggers off.  But I still say the game feels better than a 6/10 so I gave it a 7.[/spoiler]",1.0

Those enemies can then be converted to join your side.

Each unit has their own set of positive and negative quirks and those can change on levelup or later be modified manually. If one of your units dies, they are gone for good. If you are captured however, you can later get missions to rescue those units.

7783,137170371.0,2321210,"Allow me to cut to the chase;  Are you a fan of Dead Cells and Hades? Then you'll find this game both familiar and different. Like a certain fit of a new pair of jeans that are delightfully different because they came from a new company.

Aesthetically, there's more than enough difference that on a visual level it feels wholly different from the aforementioned games. In fact, a ton of detail, care and love has gone into the various special effects, character design and art to give it futuristic neon-rave feel and somehow, without agitating the holly hell out of my astigmatism. (Well done, devs.)

The game-play feels more like Dead Cells, or more recently Have A Nice Death (with a touch of rhythm and timing) - very fast paced, flashy side-scrolling with all the replayability you'd expect from games of this genre. The hub has a plethora of upgrades to pursue, making your path and choices throughout your runs rather difficult, when it feels like you need a bit of everything to make progress.

My gripes about this game at the moment, are minimal. 
-The host of resources you need seems a bit overwhelming in the beginning. I caught myself asking, ""wtf do I need this for, again?"" more often than I'd like. 
-The musical-battle aspect is very minimal and feels a bit tacked on, as it only affects one skill and it's not easy hit just basing your timing on the music. The audio cue isn't prominent enough and by the time I try to register the timing, the moment has passed and I end up with the weaker variation of the skill every time. I had to use my peripheral vision to have any success with it.
-Finally, the voice acting. Not so much the accents - I applaud anyone from any Asian descent that grew up with their native language, to even attempt to adapt to English. A specific nitpick of mine, the audio doesn't match with the subtitles. Not a huge issue, but it does break immersion.

Although I usually stray from early-access games at a price, I don't regret this one bit. I'm excited to see the future improvements and characters. More than anything, I hope to see more characters, maybe new weapons for each character and whatever else the devs see fit to add.

(I'm not good at top-down shooters, but I enjoyed HM.)

1. For HM,I used gamepad and lock.
I enjoyed constantly switch between lock-fire-unlock-lock-fire with sometimes fire without lock.
For this game, I just can't stand using gamepad (there's no lock), so I changed to mouse/keyboard.
There's no problem here, but for  it's just any game but not HM for me.

2. This game provides an HP bar, so normally I would think it encourges you to act bravely.
But with focus skill, it becomes contradictory:
2.1 You wouldn't use focus at easy levels,because HP bar is there for you to shoot without thinking
2.2 Or you had to use focus in multiple enemies or too fast enemy/bullet condition,but slowing everything down 
is reducing feeling of intense.
So you won't get as much adrenaline as in HM, the game becomes slow and less intelligence.

3. Why focus skill makes you have less viewport??? It's just ridiculous and not reasonable,image your Focus Increase in the real world.And I got increased-chance not seeing bullets  and enemy far away!!!

4.Why killer has to break glass everytime he drunk wine?It's killing time and makes him look silly.

After all,I can't get as much thinking as in HM in this game, both stroy or level-design/gameplay.

Great Princess Maker-esque (or Long Live the Queen) game despite some bugs and iffy english texts. 8/10

The good: There is a lot of things you can do, and choices to make that will give varying results without being too punishing. Aside from story related choices most mistakes can be fixed as long as you're not going for a perfect run.
A lot of short mini-games to keep it interesting without it being a chore, since obviously you'll be doing them more than once if you're aiming for a specific stat.
Although I've only reached one ending as of this review, the story and ending was nothing too far from what I would've expected from the choices I made.
The visuals are good, cute, and fitting.

The bad: At the time of the review, mainly the bugs and iffy english translations.
I ran into a few bugs but nothing terribly unavoidable or detrimental to the progression, but there were times where I needed to restart the game. At least the auto save is there in case you forget to manually save.
The text is mostly broken or have grammatical/spelling errors, but most are comprehensible to a point. This may bother some and break the immersion. Nothing was broken to the point of making a wrong choice during my first playthrough.

Some minor QoL functions are missing, such as text skipping but honestly since most texts are short it's not the end of the world.

You have to truly ponder what decisions you have made along the way that brought you to the place of your final reckoning.

It is still unclear, even to me, why I purchased The Monstrous Horror Show. 
There isn't anything wrong with it, with those nudity scenes throughout it's perfectly stellar. But when you look at it as a choice, you realize just how flawed you and the rest of humanity is.

What drove me to purchase such a game? What part of my soul felt so empty that I thought a virtual girl could fill it?
When I look into the boundless depths of my own loneliness I see a pool of reflection. My face isn't there, there is no face. There are only tears in that pool, tears of shame and loss and confusion.

If it were up to me again I know I would purchase it in a heartbeat, I know I would load it up and skip through the countless window prompts so I can have a single morsel of pornographic images which are readily available online.
Yet, despite the abundance of naked virtual women waiting in the digital sphere, I still chose to purchase this game and devote hours of my life to it. That time will never return to me, it is lost just like my soul and just like the time I fear I may never find it again.

There is something broken within me, something that desires sensation beyond my reach, something that whimpers every single night with the knowledge that there is no true Princess, it is a merely an illusion.
In my pursuit to find meaning in this long life, I sought the colorful lights and sounds of a world that only exists in a pop up window on my computer.

Mageseeker is a masterpiece. The story is spectacular and each detail immerses you in the league of legends universe. The fighting felt action packed, quick and not too free. I played through the entire game on the hardest difficulty and did not get to the end of the game without a bit of a struggle. This game does a great job with slowly rolling you out new tools to take on different types of enemies by making different elements have a counter element. Hopefully everything in here is canon and they start dropping characters in league from these Riot forge games. I'd like to see Rukko, Yops and Wisteria ported over in some way. 

I do have some grips with the game, specifically the feeling that they ran out of ideas to make it to the end of the game, but didnt want you to go from cut scene to cut scene. So they made filler by just throwing more enemies at you. about the last 20%-30% of the game, I had unlocked everything and started skipping side quests. Another thing that bothers me is the lack of end game anything. When you are done, yeah you can play through and tune the difficulty but besides that you are maxed out and your moving... game just ended.

It has ""Metroidvania"" tag, but I haven't seen any ability gating so far (most ""gates"" are bosses or keys like in dark souls). The map is also a collection of locations between which you teleport, and so far they seemed pretty linear, though you would expect a non-linear interconnected map in most metroidvanias. The fact that the map is absent is also quite annoying and, while common in souls-like games, is pretty frustrating for a game that claims to be metroidvania, and makes tracking your exploration progress much harder than it should be.",1.0

Great graphics and sound, just like its predecessor. Once again, bonus points for ultrawide support. No complaints about the presentation, but some of the characters definitely rub me the wrong way. YMMV in that department. 

I had read that the original writer passed away. I see this left the team with a difficult choice. To their credit, I could not tell the difference between the two. It emulates the same style and tone, and I imagine this is intentional to honor the spirit of the original author's intent. Unfortunately, I think the writing was the worst part of the original by far, and I see this as a missed opportunity to move on from that. 

All of the supernatural elements in this story are but the thinnest of veils for what is ultimately a collection of modern day social media discourse. There is rampant virtue signaling, and every character speaks about the world around them as if they live inside Twitter. There are a scant few genuine moments, and I can appreciate the fact that the writer(s?) clearly feel a lot of angst about putting themselves out there and the creative process in general. There is a complete lack of subtlety in the writing regarding this, but I see it and I get it. 

It feels a lot more disappointing than the first one, as we're familiar with much of the cast already, and there's not a lot of progress or poignancy in their respective narratives. I genuinely came away from this game feeling like I spent a few hours reading Twitter threads. It's nothing but surface level social commentary.

Given that the intent here was probably to honor the original writer, I'd still be in for a Coffee Talk 3 in the hopes that they show some growth and try something different. If that one also ends up being the same, I'd definitely call it quits. 

FWIW, this is certainly a worthy tribute for those who do not find fault with the original.",0.0

And this sequel is totally a deserving and heartwarming sequel to the first game. The characters had all grown and we get to dive deeper on their new emerging problems as they enter a new stage of their life. Meeting them again in this game feels like meeting an old friend whom you haven't talked in so long, and yet you still share the old memories of those years gone by (gosh, I sound like Hyde, don't I...). But yeah it's nice to continue their story while meeting new curious characters as well.

I personally love that in this game and the previous game, Toge doesn't shy away from discussing heavy but important topics, especially for us youngsters looking to find our way to navigate the world. Some of the conversations between the characters do got me thinking and definitely there is a lesson learned there somewhere. But that aside, it's what you would expect the sequel of a chill and heartwarming story would be. And not gonna lie, I almost always have a smile in my face while playing this game, and even if I'm not smiling, there is always something I feel inside, which shows how good the storytelling on this game is as you easily get emotionally and physically (sometimes mentally) invested in the game. It's as if you are following the journey of the characters as if you are really part of the story, which is the appeal of this game from the first sequel as well. So I can't thank you everyone at Toge (including the late Mr. Fahmi) for bringing us such an amazing story and game to experience. Although I can't speak for everyone, so I would recommend everyone to try and see for themselves and hopefully it would leave a lasting mark on everyone too, as it already leave quite a remarkable memories for me personally.

7854,137178860.0,782250,"The dialogue is entertaining, but it's quite annoying to play without a guide. There is a definite ""correct"" or ""best"" path due to how game-y everything is. Lack of rollback or autosaving can also make things pretty annoying. Hope your ""save at every choice"" game is strong, or god forbid you fat finger or misclick something. On that note, prepare for soooooo much backtracking, even if you didn't make a choice on accident. Seriously, how do you include random nonsense ""comedic"" game overs multiple hours in without a rollback function?

Also, the ""they"" thing is super weird. I assume they did it to not have to record audio (or write dialogue) twice. Still, it's hard to be immersed in a story where you are essentially playing an amorphous blob with no discernible concrete personality traits or identity. It makes for bizarre moments in conversation (and particularly more intimate parts), where the characters (and game) can't actually describe your character because they're completely nondescript. I assume by the themes and more dramatic tone of some parts, they were indeed trying to make you take the story more seriously this time around. If that's the case, I feel it would have been more wise to have picked a gender, picked some at least basic personality traits, and committed to them so it felt like the characters were relating to a person as opposed to an amorphous creature that was just trying to pick the right options to get their pants off. I think it would have really helped the writing.

This game for sure has some flaws that could have and probably should have been ironed out but they are not game breaking. Most peoples problems with the damage and combat are no where near as bad as said once you start upgrading your armor and your hp/stamina pool. i am playing on the 3rd difficulty (there is 4) and im at a point i feel like i could be on the 4th if i want more of a challenge but could still progress. the actual issues with the game are your weapon ""special attacks"" feel like they were an oversight. like whoever created them was like ""oh lets add a decent strong attack with a cooldown for brownie points"" but never actually field tested them. they are like a 2/10 on usefullness. they are god awful slow animations that can just be and WILL BE interupted by an enemy attack and do not do enough poise damage or hp damage to be like ""man i NEED to get this move off"". yes of course i still always try to use them lol but they are implemented horribly. they parry/dodge system is actually pretty good and cool except if there are multiple enemies attacking. again i think this was an oversight without field testing. you can only parry one attack and HAVE to wait till the parry animation is done to do another meaning if a second enemy is attacking you ARE getting hit no way around it which takes away from skill expression. the fact enemies can constantly interupt/daze you compared to you BARELY ever is just a forced way to add difficulty but take away skill expression/immersion when even the littlest creatures/humans use a light attack and do it yet you used a massive hammer heavy swing and they just swing right through it like yyeeeaahhhh OK not going to happen. its comically bad and frustrating as it breaks your combat groove but again its not gamebreaking and can be worked around. everything else is great. the scenery changes between darker battlegrounds to lush colorful nature. voice acting is fine as long as you dont mind british sounding accents. besides the weird battle flaws i described battles are actually satisfying learning movesets and the finishers are nice looking and quick (most of them). the parry/dodge thing everyone complaining about the game telling you not to look at the color but the movements is i think just a description mistake and the part of the devs. the best way to explain it is you dont HAVE to just react to blue=parry and red=dodge. like you can still dodge backwards on a blue overhead swing. no you cant parry a red attack but you CAN block every attack with a shield wepon. the story isnt too deep from what ive gathered so far but it is unique and interesting so it makes you want to actually uncover the whole thing. if you like adventure/exploration games with action combat this is a very nice and fun game for sure worth picking up.",1.0

But understand this is definitely an early access title and not a complete game in my eyes, if Development stops short this review may change.

Review:
So all in all i've played this game for a couple hours with my gaming group and we plan to play more.

The game is basically a Hide and Seek, Scavenger Hunt, that can feel a bit long winded at first, but once you start collecting and turning in the blood to create the blood orbs, not only does the game get darker (lower brightness) but the monsters become increasingly active. With this mechanic its kind of interesting to see the game change, however I feel this leaves a flaw in gameplay as you could simply ignore blood for a time and gather the pages, then start turning in the blood and making a break for the end portal, thereby making the game easier. My recommendation here would be to create a soft time limit that every ""X"" minutes or so, the stage treats it as though a blood orb as been gathered (i.e. get darker, more active monsters) without of course awarding the blood orb, to make the game increasingly more difficult as time progresses, similar to how hunts in Phasmophobia work. I would also add a lose condition based on time (a generous amount of time) where the ancient one would awaken. Side note for fun we tried to enter the portal once without a complete book, just for fun to see what would happen and sadly you can't, though we did end up swarmed by numerous enemies. 

I also feel like there is definite room for growth in the tool department, as running with just a lanter, book and blood vials really leaves the gameplay a little waning. Add some more unique lore based one shot items that can help in situations and also add some depth to the gameplay.

The art design is honestly on point. I'm a huge sucker for the Lovecraftian horror genre and feel like the atmosphere is quite accurate. I will say though I would like to see more interesting levels aside from just scavenger hunting through a forest. Perhaps a giant mansion style map with new horrors etc.

There are some visual bugs to be sure. Like walking (floating) on some of the rocks near the perimeter of the map. A couple of rocks that when trying to walk on you would clip through, and one situation where one of our group became stuck on a log, unable to move.

Another thing I would recommend removing is the cutscene when a blood orb is generated, as the game is not paused and the individual that places the last blood into the altar is basically helpless once the cutscene begins. Honestly, its not really needed in my opinion and only adds a small level of frustration when trying to complete the last blood orb, monsters nearby and you're trying to make a clean getaway only to be caught mid cutscene.

Other than that, for $8 USD I feel like I could get my money's worth of entertainment from the game, and its a chance to support an indie dev. This view is of course subjective so I dont fully expect anyone to necessarily agree with me, but all in all its a nice little lovecraftian horror game that is simple to just jump into and enjoy a round or two.",1.0
7861,137180369.0,1918970,"Been looking out for this game since the first ever reveal and DAMN, i loved it. But for the note: This game is in its EARLIEST state right now. With bugs that where you can clip out from the map and get stuck under the rocks or can't even navigate yourself and easily can get lost or go in circles, game itself really has the atmosphere of Lovecraftian place and really gives the vibes of it with its mysterious island. Monsters and their mechanics (how to avoid them, how they find you and etc) are great. Objective of the game is pretty straightforward though. Which for someone who grasped what to do in order to find / collect necessary stuff for plot to move, it can be pretty short. But of course, exploration for the first time was really magical and pulled me in easily.

If this game is gonna receive new maps (perhaps a city map, or something different from just an island like an desert or inside an pyramid) then there should be more different kind of objectives and more focused on story telling and letting the player find out what to do other than just explaining what is the goal of you and your cultist friends right at the start of the game.

A few talkative npc's around the area that's hidden leading to an side-mission or objective where you can unlock more secrets perhaps? Who knows.

With that said, I am looking forward for more content from this game and its developers. I absolutely love the idea of this game and can't play again when its a lot more polished and more filled with cosmic secrets that will drive you to insanity.",1.0

7885,137183056.0,1457080,"The Mageseeker is another great game from Riot Forge that proves one of the biggest strengths of the world of League of Legends; the lore and characters.

A lot of the first reviews I saw for The Mageseeker highlighted that it was a short game, but for the price tag I was very happy with the length of the game - in fact it took longer for me to complete than I thought it would. Though it's worth pointing out there is very little replay value here.

The difficulty is another plus, I played on the highest preset difficulty (you can fine-tune aspects of the difficulty if you wish which is a nice feature) and I found many of the boss battles to be a welcome challenge. They also were always a great spectacle, particularly the fights against [spoiler] Jarvan/Shyvana, Wisteria and Morgana [/spoiler], and were coupled with great music which plays on riffs familiar to people who follow the lore of League.

The combat is really unique and represents Sylas fantastically, though I think it can sometimes be a bit awkward to target the correct enemy in fights and it doesn't completely click in the earlier stages of the game. However, as you advance through the game and acquire better abilities it really comes into its own. The battles in the last few missions are fantastic and you are really tested on your ability to juggle spells.

The Mageseeker features a good number of cameos from League and Legends of Runeterra characters, many of which you would expect based on the premise. It's great to get to know them more and allow their story to develop. In addition it also introduces lots of interesting new characters as both allies and enemies. As for the big picture, the struggle between the rebel mages, the mageseekers and Demacia as a whole makes for a compelling story, especially when you sprinkle in meddling from Noxus and the Black Rose.

Overall, The Mageseeker delivered everything I was looking for when it came to exploring the story of Sylas and Demacia and also has challenging gameplay that rewards your experience in it. so it's a strong recommendation from me.",1.0

If you enjoying this game, good for you, I'm happy for you, this is just my experience what I'm writing down.

This game made me really mad right at the beginning.
On 1440p, epic settings, this game ran 35-45 FPS. Even FSR on, the max was 55.
Why?! 
I have no clue. I got a RTX2070 and I played Cyberpunk 2077 on all high, dlss on, 1440p with 75-95 FPS, or WD: Legion very high and some ultra settings, dlss on, 1440p with 65-100 FPS. 
There isn't any reason why this game ran so shitty on my rig.

But I was very generous, so I went back to 1080p with FSR on and the game ran with 85 FPS.
I wasn't really happy about this, but ok.

Let me tell you one thing: 
I've finished Elden Ring, Remnant from the Ashes, Code Vein, so I'm not totally unexperienced with these kind of ""souls like"" games.

But the combat in this game...maaan...
Dodging is somewhat ok, but parry. It's broken AF.
The game warns you to not react to the flashing indicator (that seems pretty stupid to me, but ok), but man... I died 3 times because I coudn't parry at all. Even when I tried to react on the last second of the animation, nothing happened. I just took the hit. So after 3x of dying + the problem with the graphics I asked for a refund. 

So, this is my wonderful experience with this game. :D

Steam Support may help if you ask nicely by choosing ‘I have a question about this purchase.’ They say Speedstorm is complimentary with each pack, however, I see no option to play a free version of this on the store page. It only shows free on the receipt. This just seems shady at best on Gameloft’s part. For what it’s worth, the game itself is decently fun, but doesn’t do anything to reinvent the wheel, so to speak. Honestly if you have MarioKart or other good cart racers like I do, maybe just stick to those. This requires prohibitively too much playtime to unlock things, in my opinion.

7,137166939,1681060,"For now, i cannot recommend this. The early game (2-3 hours) is fun, then it turns into a slog. The big issue is money, and frankly it's not reassuring that such a critical element just a few hours in isn't noticed by the devs. 

There are broadly 3 sources of income: funding (which runs out after just a year, for some reason), mining, and patents. The most common ore is useless except to sell, but sells for so little that it's barely worth it. You cannot sell the other ores either. This leaves patents. With some luck and planning you can get some good patents that can pay quite well. unfortunately, there are too many categories which vastly dilutes how much theories you have, which greatly reduces the potential value of patents.

The biggest drain on your budget is wages. The system is bizarre: initial pay is what the person will cost, forever. Levelling up does not increase pay. Higher wages employees will have higher stats, but this is a noob trap. Money is the limiting factor, not skills. So you have to hire everyone minimum wage or else you are simply shooting yourself in the foot, not just on the short term but forever. 

The end result of all of this is that you simply softlock at some point. You run out of patents, planets to explore, and mining ore simply cannot sustain your program. The aliens don't actually have to do anything to defeat you: your own budget will. Although again, they represent a significant drain in either soldiers (lvl1 soldiers cannot 1v1 a single alien and the first invasion already features 3. this is absurd. But you also cannot compel anyone to defend or focus fire, so a soldier will run to the canteen to grab some food as the aliens are barging through the gate).

9,137168259,1928870,"It's no Warcraft 3 but it's still fun. It being open world through me off at first but I quickly grew to like it. The world is dynamic with constant piglin expansions and invasions that you can choose to deal with or ignore. There isn't a huge amount of units but they all serve a unique role with none feeling useless. Both the defence and attack gameplay is fun. I remember when I was younger I would build walls and redstone turrets around a village then spawn a load of mobs to create a siege, you can do that for real now. The mission structure is the same for the whole game, destroy 3 bases then fight the boss for each faction. Each faction has completely different base architecture with different weaknesses though so it doesn't feel like you're doing the same thing. My major complaint is the lack of factions which is pretty unheard of for an rts game. Another complaint is the player character does literally 0 damage to high tier enemies, bosses and buildings so all you can do is take out the weaklings while your units do everything important, it especially sucks for boss fights. 3/4 boss fights were boring because you can't do anything yourself. I liked one of the bosses because you have to defend a village from it or you lose. The final boss was just more of the same, spawn a load of units next to it and run around, Not being able to hurt bosses with your sword was a really dumb design choice. People have different attention spans so I can't tell when you will get bored but for me the campaign slightly overstayed its welcome. In the last hour I just wanted it to end.

16,137166127,1698220,"Quite simply, Teslagrad 2 takes all of the elements that made Teslagrad 1 great, and cranks them into overdrive.

The Story: Preserving the same methods of silent storytelling as the original, T2 links T1 and World to the West together to make a seamless cohesive storyline. Seemingly innocuous background art from T1 is given massive significance in T2, and new story elements introduced in T2 are deliberately left a bit vague so they can be expanded in future games. Characters have complex motives which gives them a lot of depth.

The Music: Jørn Lavoll outdoes himself. Fire up the game and listen to the title screen music. Just listen, let it develop. It didn't have to be that good since most people will just spam a button to get to the menus, but what an intro. Many more musical styles are explored here, ranging from heavy metal to jungle to whimsical, with plenty of callbacks to music from T1.

The Gameplay: Movement is much more fluid and rewarding. Blinking, a core ability from T1, is given to you from the very start of T2. Sliding was an ability cut from T1 but brought back in T2, and the levels embrace it in plenty of places, with slopes everywhere to launch from. Simple platforming and very mild puzzles lead up to the first boss, but then the puzzle platforming begins to show its true robustness, with new puzzle elements supported by the new item collectibles. Lots more variety in terrain, and some very-appreciated ""fast-travel checkpoint"" options to get around the much larger map. The boss fights start easy and ramp up to very hard if you're going for all achievements.

This game is a masterpiece. If you liked Teslagrad 1 in any capacity, this is a must-play.",1.0

38,137172420,1457080,"Up front I'll give it a score of 7/10.  Probably should bump it down to a 6/10 for the bait'n'switch they pull in a sidequest, but I'll get to that in the spoiler section.  Combat's fun for the most part, but there is one fatal flaw that absolutely killed it for me.

For starters: a lot of people thought this was going to be a roguelite/rogue-like. It is neither, it's a straight-up linear progression story. In terms of gameplay it's like a cross between the old God of War games and an arcade beat'em up (Streets of Rage, Ninja Turtles, Final Fight, etc). In between levels you wander around camp, talk to people, put points into your upgrades, then start up the next level.

Combat was fun with a fair amount of options in terms of abilities. As those familiar with Sylas from LoL would expect, a key mechanic is stealing spells off of your enemies. Once you've stolen a spell you can unlock it as an equipable spell. While stolen spells are used for free, when you're holding a stolen spell you don't have access to your equipped spells so you have to use the stolen one first. Equipped spells use mana. Your mana bar has up to 4 pips, and each spell costs a different number of pips. Mana is rebuilt by doing regular and strong attacks, strong attacks restoring more.

So you can find your favorite spells and equip them, but you're by no means a spell-spammer. Most of the best spells in the game cost 3 pips, and regaining pips takes a fair amount of physical attacking. With regards to melee combat: as you progress through the game you'll unlock members of a band of ""outlaws."" These are basically equipable people that increase your damage of a certain type and give you a combo with that type as well. Like the ice guy lets you do a light > light > light > strong combo where the strong leaves a frost AoE puddle that's a DoT.

Also of note is you can use his chains to yank yourself to enemies from a pretty fair distance. Part of my bread'n'butter combo involved this with a wind kick.

So there's plenty to work with in terms of making a build to fit your playstyle. Early-ish in the game you get a spell that gives you a small amount of shield hp for 3 mana pips, and that was pretty much what I spent most of my mana on. Speaking of sustain: you also get a potion with 3 charges that can be upgraded for a 4th, and towards the end of the game you unlock Guardian Angel which gives you one revive per level. I never had it proc so I don't know how much it revives you for, it doesn't say.

As for the one thing that absolutely killed it for me: movement.  It can feel absolutely terrible at times, particularly due to the fact that you can't dash through obstacles.  Not only does this mean it's particularly easy for the enemy to corner you, but it also means that you'll get periodically stuck on random crap like an indestructible stool sitting on the floor.  For a game that's based on rapid-pace action, taking a few hits because Sylas caught his foot on a chair gets pretty frustrating.

As I mentioned, this bait'n'switch was almost enough to knock the game down to a 6/10 for me because I thought a Nocturne fight would have been awesome.  But no, just reuse an old fight, have Nocturne flip us the bird, then he buggers off.  But I still say the game feels better than a 6/10 so I gave it a 7.[/spoiler]",1.0

How does this actually play then? You go through procedually generated levels with an objective. This could be neutralizing a specific enemy, capturing one, grabbing certain types of loot or getting through the level in a set amount of time etc. You have a fulton balloon system to both grab loot and stunned enemies. Those enemies can then be converted to join your side.

Each unit has their own set of positive and negative quirks and those can change on levelup or later be modified manually. If one of your units dies, they are gone for good. If you are captured however, you can later get missions to rescue those units.

55,137170371,2321210,"Allow me to cut to the chase;  Are you a fan of Dead Cells and Hades? Then you'll find this game both familiar and different. Like a certain fit of a new pair of jeans that are delightfully different because they came from a new company.

Aesthetically, there's more than enough difference that on a visual level it feels wholly different from the aforementioned games. In fact, a ton of detail, care and love has gone into the various special effects, character design and art to give it futuristic neon-rave feel and somehow, without agitating the holly hell out of my astigmatism. (Well done, devs.)

The game-play feels more like Dead Cells, or more recently Have A Nice Death (with a touch of rhythm and timing) - very fast paced, flashy side-scrolling with all the replayability you'd expect from games of this genre. The hub has a plethora of upgrades to pursue, making your path and choices throughout your runs rather difficult, when it feels like you need a bit of everything to make progress.

My gripes about this game at the moment, are minimal. 
-The host of resources you need seems a bit overwhelming in the beginning. I caught myself asking, ""wtf do I need this for, again?"" more often than I'd like. 
-The musical-battle aspect is very minimal and feels a bit tacked on, as it only affects one skill and it's not easy hit just basing your timing on the music. The audio cue isn't prominent enough and by the time I try to register the timing, the moment has passed and I end up with the weaker variation of the skill every time. I had to use my peripheral vision to have any success with it.
-Finally, the voice acting. Not so much the accents - I applaud anyone from any Asian descent that grew up with their native language, to even attempt to adapt to English. A specific nitpick of mine, the audio doesn't match with the subtitles. Not a huge issue, but it does break immersion.

Although I usually stray from early-access games at a price, I don't regret this one bit. I'm excited to see the future improvements and characters. More than anything, I hope to see more characters, maybe new weapons for each character and whatever else the devs see fit to add.

The voice acting is very cute, and the art is amazing! So many (diverse) romance options, not gender locked at all! Though, for some people it might be a con that you can only play as a father to a little girl, and can't change the gender. (Though it is titled Volcano Princess not Prince but I digress)

(I'm not good at top-down shooters, but I enjoyed HM.)

1. For HM,I used gamepad and lock.
I enjoyed constantly switch between lock-fire-unlock-lock-fire with sometimes fire without lock.
For this game, I just can't stand using gamepad (there's no lock), so I changed to mouse/keyboard.
There's no problem here, but for  it's just any game but not HM for me.

2. This game provides an HP bar, so normally I would think it encourges you to act bravely.
But with focus skill, it becomes contradictory:
2.1 You wouldn't use focus at easy levels,because HP bar is there for you to shoot without thinking
2.2 Or you had to use focus in multiple enemies or too fast enemy/bullet condition,but slowing everything down 
is reducing feeling of intense.
So you won't get as much adrenaline as in HM, the game becomes slow and less intelligence.

3. Why focus skill makes you have less viewport??? It's just ridiculous and not reasonable,image your Focus Increase in the real world.And I got increased-chance not seeing bullets  and enemy far away!!!

4.Why killer has to break glass everytime he drunk wine?It's killing time and makes him look silly.

After all,I can't get as much thinking as in HM in this game, both stroy or level-design/gameplay.
But I 'll continue to play through it.

Great Princess Maker-esque (or Long Live the Queen) game despite some bugs and iffy english texts. 8/10

The good: There is a lot of things you can do, and choices to make that will give varying results without being too punishing. Aside from story related choices most mistakes can be fixed as long as you're not going for a perfect run.
A lot of short mini-games to keep it interesting without it being a chore, since obviously you'll be doing them more than once if you're aiming for a specific stat.
Although I've only reached one ending as of this review, the story and ending was nothing too far from what I would've expected from the choices I made.
The visuals are good, cute, and fitting.

The bad: At the time of the review, mainly the bugs and iffy english translations.
I ran into a few bugs but nothing terribly unavoidable or detrimental to the progression, but there were times where I needed to restart the game. At least the auto save is there in case you forget to manually save.
The text is mostly broken or have grammatical/spelling errors, but most are comprehensible to a point. This may bother some and break the immersion. Nothing was broken to the point of making a wrong choice during my first playthrough.

Some minor QoL functions are missing, such as text skipping but honestly since most texts are short it's not the end of the world.
Both manual and auto saves start at the beginning of the day, so there is no way to save right before choices. But again, the texts aren't long so it's not that difficult to go back to the same spot from the start of the day.",1.0

It is still unclear, even to me, why I purchased The Monstrous Horror Show. 
There isn't anything wrong with it, with those nudity scenes throughout it's perfectly stellar. But when you look at it as a choice, you realize just how flawed you and the rest of humanity is.

What drove me to purchase such a game? What part of my soul felt so empty that I thought a virtual girl could fill it?
When I look into the boundless depths of my own loneliness I see a pool of reflection. My face isn't there, there is no face. There are only tears in that pool, tears of shame and loss and confusion.

If it were up to me again I know I would purchase it in a heartbeat, I know I would load it up and skip through the countless window prompts so I can have a single morsel of pornographic images which are readily available online.
Yet, despite the abundance of naked virtual women waiting in the digital sphere, I still chose to purchase this game and devote hours of my life to it. That time will never return to me, it is lost just like my soul and just like the time I fear I may never find it again.

Mageseeker is a masterpiece. The story is spectacular and each detail immerses you in the league of legends universe. The fighting felt action packed, quick and not too free. I played through the entire game on the hardest difficulty and did not get to the end of the game without a bit of a struggle. This game does a great job with slowly rolling you out new tools to take on different types of enemies by making different elements have a counter element. Hopefully everything in here is canon and they start dropping characters in league from these Riot forge games. I'd like to see Rukko, Yops and Wisteria ported over in some way. 

I do have some grips with the game, specifically the feeling that they ran out of ideas to make it to the end of the game, but didnt want you to go from cut scene to cut scene. So they made filler by just throwing more enemies at you. about the last 20%-30% of the game, I had unlocked everything and started skipping side quests. Another thing that bothers me is the lack of end game anything.

It has ""Metroidvania"" tag, but I haven't seen any ability gating so far (most ""gates"" are bosses or keys like in dark souls). The map is also a collection of locations between which you teleport, and so far they seemed pretty linear, though you would expect a non-linear interconnected map in most metroidvanias. The fact that the map is absent is also quite annoying and, while common in souls-like games, is pretty frustrating for a game that claims to be metroidvania, and makes tracking your exploration progress much harder than it should be.",1.0

119,137180843,1663220,"A missed opportunity. But, if you liked the original, you'll like this one as well.

Great graphics and sound, just like its predecessor. Once again, bonus points for ultrawide support. No complaints about the presentation, but some of the characters definitely rub me the wrong way. YMMV in that department. 

I had read that the original writer passed away. I see this left the team with a difficult choice. To their credit, I could not tell the difference between the two. It emulates the same style and tone, and I imagine this is intentional to honor the spirit of the original author's intent. Unfortunately, I think the writing was the worst part of the original by far, and I see this as a missed opportunity to move on from that. 

All of the supernatural elements in this story are but the thinnest of veils for what is ultimately a collection of modern day social media discourse. There is rampant virtue signaling, and every character speaks about the world around them as if they live inside Twitter. There are a scant few genuine moments, and I can appreciate the fact that the writer(s?) clearly feel a lot of angst about putting themselves out there and the creative process in general. There is a complete lack of subtlety in the writing regarding this, but I see it and I get it. 

It feels a lot more disappointing than the first one, as we're familiar with much of the cast already, and there's not a lot of progress or poignancy in their respective narratives. I genuinely came away from this game feeling like I spent a few hours reading Twitter threads. It's nothing but surface level social commentary.

Given that the intent here was probably to honor the original writer, I'd still be in for a Coffee Talk 3 in the hopes that they show some growth and try something different. If that one also ends up being the same, I'd definitely call it quits. 

FWIW, this is certainly a worthy tribute for those who do not find fault with the original.",0.0

121,137180549,1663220,"I can't really put into words how much Toge Productions and its games has continously exceed my expectations. And this sequel is totally a deserving and heartwarming sequel to the first game. The characters had all grown and we get to dive deeper on their new emerging problems as they enter a new stage of their life. Meeting them again in this game feels like meeting an old friend whom you haven't talked in so long, and yet you still share the old memories of those years gone by (gosh, I sound like Hyde, don't I...). But yeah it's nice to continue their story while meeting new curious characters as well.

I personally love that in this game and the previous game, Toge doesn't shy away from discussing heavy but important topics, especially for us youngsters looking to find our way to navigate the world. Some of the conversations between the characters do got me thinking and definitely there is a lesson learned there somewhere. But that aside, it's what you would expect the sequel of a chill and heartwarming story would be. And not gonna lie, I almost always have a smile in my face while playing this game, and even if I'm not smiling, there is always something I feel inside, which shows how good the storytelling on this game is as you easily get emotionally and physically (sometimes mentally) invested in the game. It's as if you are following the journey of the characters as if you are really part of the story, which is the appeal of this game from the first sequel as well. So I can't thank you everyone at Toge (including the late Mr. Fahmi) for bringing us such an amazing story and game to experience. Although I can't speak for everyone, so I would recommend everyone to try and see for themselves and hopefully it would leave a lasting mark on everyone too, as it already leave quite a remarkable memories for me personally.

126,137178860,782250,"The dialogue is entertaining, but it's quite annoying to play without a guide. There is a definite ""correct"" or ""best"" path due to how game-y everything is. Lack of rollback or autosaving can also make things pretty annoying. Hope your ""save at every choice"" game is strong, or god forbid you fat finger or misclick something. On that note, prepare for soooooo much backtracking, even if you didn't make a choice on accident. Seriously, how do you include random nonsense ""comedic"" game overs multiple hours in without a rollback function?

Also, the ""they"" thing is super weird. I assume they did it to not have to record audio (or write dialogue) twice. Still, it's hard to be immersed in a story where you are essentially playing an amorphous blob with no discernible concrete personality traits or identity. It makes for bizarre moments in conversation (and particularly more intimate parts), where the characters (and game) can't actually describe your character because they're completely nondescript. I assume by the themes and more dramatic tone of some parts, they were indeed trying to make you take the story more seriously this time around. If that's the case, I feel it would have been more wise to have picked a gender, picked some at least basic personality traits, and committed to them so it felt like the characters were relating to a person as opposed to an amorphous creature that was just trying to pick the right options to get their pants off. I think it would have really helped the writing.

This isn't a bad game; it has several great parts. But this is not a rating, it's a recommendation, so no I wouldn't recommend it, unless you're really nostalgic for the old stat based dating flash games of yester year and this is exactly what you're looking for.",0.0

Most peoples problems with the damage and combat are no where near as bad as said once you start upgrading your armor and your hp/stamina pool. i am playing on the 3rd difficulty (there is 4) and im at a point i feel like i could be on the 4th if i want more of a challenge but could still progress. the actual issues with the game are your weapon ""special attacks"" feel like they were an oversight. like whoever created them was like ""oh lets add a decent strong attack with a cooldown for brownie points"" but never actually field tested them. they are like a 2/10 on usefullness. they are god awful slow animations that can just be and WILL BE interupted by an enemy attack and do not do enough poise damage or hp damage to be like ""man i NEED to get this move off"". yes of course i still always try to use them lol but they are implemented horribly. they parry/dodge system is actually pretty good and cool except if there are multiple enemies attacking. again i think this was an oversight without field testing. you can only parry one attack and HAVE to wait till the parry animation is done to do another meaning if a second enemy is attacking you ARE getting hit no way around it which takes away from skill expression. the fact enemies can constantly interupt/daze you compared to you BARELY ever is just a forced way to add difficulty but take away skill expression/immersion when even the littlest creatures/humans use a light attack and do it yet you used a massive hammer heavy swing and they just swing right through it like yyeeeaahhhh OK not going to happen. its comically bad and frustrating as it breaks your combat groove but again its not gamebreaking and can be worked around. everything else is great. the scenery changes between darker battlegrounds to lush colorful nature. voice acting is fine as long as you dont mind british sounding accents. besides the weird battle flaws i described battles are actually satisfying learning movesets and the finishers are nice looking and quick (most of them). the parry/dodge thing everyone complaining about the game telling you not to look at the color but the movements is i think just a description mistake and the part of the devs. the best way to explain it is you dont HAVE to just react to blue=parry and red=dodge. like you can still dodge backwards on a blue overhead swing. no you cant parry a red attack but you CAN block every attack with a shield wepon. the story isnt too deep from what ive gathered so far but it is unique and interesting so it makes you want to actually uncover the whole thing. if you like adventure/exploration games with action combat this is a very nice and fun game for sure worth picking up.",1.0

132,137182038,1918970,"TL;DR: Game is off to a great start and found it enjoyable, are there a few bugs and rough spots? Sure, but as an indie Dev I'll usually give some leeway in that area. Also for the price, its not really breaking the bank to support the developer as they clearly grasp some of the atmosphere, I'd like to see how this game could really grow. But understand this is definitely an early access title and not a complete game in my eyes, if Development stops short this review may change.

Review:
So all in all i've played this game for a couple hours with my gaming group and we plan to play more.

The game is basically a Hide and Seek, Scavenger Hunt, that can feel a bit long winded at first, but once you start collecting and turning in the blood to create the blood orbs, not only does the game get darker (lower brightness) but the monsters become increasingly active. With this mechanic its kind of interesting to see the game change, however I feel this leaves a flaw in gameplay as you could simply ignore blood for a time and gather the pages, then start turning in the blood and making a break for the end portal, thereby making the game easier. My recommendation here would be to create a soft time limit that every ""X"" minutes or so, the stage treats it as though a blood orb as been gathered (i.e. get darker, more active monsters) without of course awarding the blood orb, to make the game increasingly more difficult as time progresses, similar to how hunts in Phasmophobia work. I would also add a lose condition based on time (a generous amount of time) where the ancient one would awaken. Side note for fun we tried to enter the portal once without a complete book, just for fun to see what would happen and sadly you can't, though we did end up swarmed by numerous enemies. 

I also feel like there is definite room for growth in the tool department, as running with just a lanter, book and blood vials really leaves the gameplay a little waning. Add some more unique lore based one shot items that can help in situations and also add some depth to the gameplay.

The art design is honestly on point. I'm a huge sucker for the Lovecraftian horror genre and feel like the atmosphere is quite accurate. I will say though I would like to see more interesting levels aside from just scavenger hunting through a forest. Perhaps a giant mansion style map with new horrors etc.

There are some visual bugs to be sure. Like walking (floating) on some of the rocks near the perimeter of the map. A couple of rocks that when trying to walk on you would clip through, and one situation where one of our group became stuck on a log, unable to move.

Another thing I would recommend removing is the cutscene when a blood orb is generated, as the game is not paused and the individual that places the last blood into the altar is basically helpless once the cutscene begins. Honestly, its not really needed in my opinion and only adds a small level of frustration when trying to complete the last blood orb, monsters nearby and you're trying to make a clean getaway only to be caught mid cutscene.

Other than that, for $8 USD I feel like I could get my money's worth of entertainment from the game, and its a chance to support an indie dev. This view is of course subjective so I dont fully expect anyone to necessarily agree with me, but all in all its a nice little lovecraftian horror game that is simple to just jump into and enjoy a round or two.",1.0
133,137180369,1918970,"Been looking out for this game since the first ever reveal and DAMN, i loved it. But for the note: This game is in its EARLIEST state right now. With bugs that where you can clip out from the map and get stuck under the rocks or can't even navigate yourself and easily can get lost or go in circles, game itself really has the atmosphere of Lovecraftian place and really gives the vibes of it with its mysterious island. Monsters and their mechanics (how to avoid them, how they find you and etc) are great. Objective of the game is pretty straightforward though. Which for someone who grasped what to do in order to find / collect necessary stuff for plot to move, it can be pretty short. But of course, exploration for the first time was really magical and pulled me in easily.

If this game is gonna receive new maps (perhaps a city map, or something different from just an island like an desert or inside an pyramid) then there should be more different kind of objectives and more focused on story telling and letting the player find out what to do other than just explaining what is the goal of you and your cultist friends right at the start of the game.

A few talkative npc's around the area that's hidden leading to an side-mission or objective where you can unlock more secrets perhaps? Who knows.

With that said, I am looking forward for more content from this game and its developers. I absolutely love the idea of this game and can't play again when its a lot more polished and more filled with cosmic secrets that will drive you to insanity.",1.0

157,137183056,1457080,"The Mageseeker is another great game from Riot Forge that proves one of the biggest strengths of the world of League of Legends; the lore and characters.

A lot of the first reviews I saw for The Mageseeker highlighted that it was a short game, but for the price tag I was very happy with the length of the game - in fact it took longer for me to complete than I thought it would. Though it's worth pointing out there is very little replay value here.

The difficulty is another plus, I played on the highest preset difficulty (you can fine-tune aspects of the difficulty if you wish which is a nice feature) and I found many of the boss battles to be a welcome challenge. They also were always a great spectacle, particularly the fights against [spoiler] Jarvan/Shyvana, Wisteria and Morgana [/spoiler], and were coupled with great music which plays on riffs familiar to people who follow the lore of League.

The combat is really unique and represents Sylas fantastically, though I think it can sometimes be a bit awkward to target the correct enemy in fights and it doesn't completely click in the earlier stages of the game. However, as you advance through the game and acquire better abilities it really comes into its own. The battles in the last few missions are fantastic and you are really tested on your ability to juggle spells.

The Mageseeker features a good number of cameos from League and Legends of Runeterra characters, many of which you would expect based on the premise. It's great to get to know them more and allow their story to develop. In addition it also introduces lots of interesting new characters as both allies and enemies. As for the big picture, the struggle between the rebel mages, the mageseekers and Demacia as a whole makes for a compelling story, especially when you sprinkle in meddling from Noxus and the Black Rose.

Overall, The Mageseeker delivered everything I was looking for when it came to exploring the story of Sylas and Demacia and also has challenging gameplay that rewards your experience in it. so it's a strong recommendation from me.",1.0

If you enjoying this game, good for you, I'm happy for you, this is just my experience what I'm writing down.

This game made me really mad right at the beginning.
On 1440p, epic settings, this game ran 35-45 FPS. Even FSR on, the max was 55.
Why?! 
I have no clue. I got a RTX2070 and I played Cyberpunk 2077 on all high, dlss on, 1440p with 75-95 FPS, or WD: Legion very high and some ultra settings, dlss on, 1440p with 65-100 FPS. 
There isn't any reason why this game ran so shitty on my rig.

But I was very generous, so I went back to 1080p with FSR on and the game ran with 85 FPS.
I wasn't really happy about this, but ok.

Let me tell you one thing: 
I've finished Elden Ring, Remnant from the Ashes, Code Vein, so I'm not totally unexperienced with these kind of ""souls like"" games.

But the combat in this game...maaan...
Dodging is somewhat ok, but parry. It's broken AF.
The game warns you to not react to the flashing indicator (that seems pretty stupid to me, but ok), but man... I died 3 times because I coudn't parry at all. Even when I tried to react on the last second of the animation, nothing happened. I just took the hit. So after 3x of dying + the problem with the graphics I asked for a refund. 

So, this is my wonderful experience with this game. :D

179,137209630,1967630,This game is just a map with creatures and resources spawning everywhere. Its like Icarus (and I hate Icarus) but worse because the UI is clunky and immersion breaking. I'm getting tired of people getting a hold of a gaming engine and then thinking they are going to make a game out of it. We don't need another game like this because there is already a dozen+. Ya sure it looks nice. Who ever made the engine did a great job. Then people get a hold of it and create crap. Remember kids. You are playing the same thing over and over.

184,137207887,1663220,"[h1] Review is split into two parts: first being people who want to know what's new/the difference from the first game, the second being more the actual Review [/h1]

[b] If you have NOT played the first game, then it is highly recommended you do so because of all the references and returning characters, along with a spoiler regarding the first game's ending[/b]

[b] New things/differences from the first game(skip this part if not interested) [/b]

[list]
    [*] Nothing carries over from the first game, and you have to unlock the recipes again. they do reference the first game a bit.
    [*] 2 new drink bases: Blue Pea and Hibiscus. a few more new recipes. for those who are planning on going into Endless mode and unlock them, there are I believe 3 that are locked behind the story, as in even if you have the right mixture it will not give you the drink until you have to make them. most if not all the old recipes are the same, but you will have to unlock them again.
    [*]Characters: there are three New main characters, Riona the banshee, Lucas the Satyr, and [spoiler] Amanada the Alien, ""sister"" to Neil. [/spoiler] there are a few other minor characters, but aside from a scene or two, aren't as big.
    [*]Returning characters: Everyone makes a reappearance to some degree. Jorgi has been expanded upon and is more than being ""just there."" Myrtle and Aqua could be considered minor characters given how they have their own storyline but it's a lot smaller comparatively. Freya only makes a single appearance near the end.
    [*] a pretty underutilized item giving mechanic, where when you give the drink you can offer an item to the patron. you can't give the wrong thing to the wrong person, but you if you forget to give someone something it can affect your hidden score and therefore endings. there isn't a whole lot of items, but some of the things may or may not be self explanatory on who you're supposed to give it to(e.g. you might have to give something to someone, but you give it to someone else related to them).
    [*]small changes that I don't feel like they need their own bullet point but should be mentioned: in Endless mode, you can now pick who to serve based on who you met now instead of just Freya. Achievements are somewhat spoiler-ly in that they outright tell you what to do to unlock them, such as serving specific drinks to unlock new songs. not sure if the previous game had these kinds of achievements, but there are a few which involve doing things like doing bad enough to make someone not come back to even getting the worst endings possible(good luck with that).
[/list]

[b] The Actual Review [/b]

The first game has a lot of charm to it. I recently played it again just to see what it was like in anticipation for the sequel.
If you are asking if this game delivers, I would say yes and no. the game is a lot like the first one, built upon it, like a 1.5, which is probably why it is titled Episode 2 instead of a straight up sequel. The story takes place about 3 years after the first one, and you end up catching up with everyone and seeing how things have changed. If you like the first game for the atmosphere and characters, then this game will definitely be something you'll enjoy. If you're looking for expansion on the game-play however, you'll probably be disappointed, as the game does very little to change it up. given it's a ""don't fix what's not broke"" approach, it makes sense, but still a fair warning. the good of the game is a lot of what the first game had, but it also is the downside of it as you're getting more of the same, just slightly expanded upon.

Story wise, it felt either too fast, or too slow at times. some moments will go by quickly, and you'll be wondering what happened, while other times it feels like they're dragging on a bit, exploring the world but given how you don't have as much direct input, it doesn't feel quite as impactful(stop forgetting your lighter Jorgi). Freya isn't around this time, so when the days are over, you'll be talking to yourself, and most of the time won't really have a moment to reflect on everything that happened. Still, you do get your happy endings, but some of the story weren't explored as much, such as with Aqua and Myrtle, so it isn't as impactful.

gameplay wise, it's the same, just with 2 new ingredients and an item giving mechanic that really is underutilized in my opinion. it does affect what endings you get, but honestly the items you get are a small selection and it's fairly easy to figure out the right item to give, and moreso of knowing who to give it to(hint: you sometimes give an item not to the person directly, but someone related to them). aside from the small changes, they aren't really as big to where the gameplay evolved, but given the kind of game it is, it's not as big of an issue. as for the length, it took me roughly less than 7 hours to beat(beaten within 2 days) not counting the reloading I had to do, so it is a short game if you know what to do or look up a guide.

I'm a fan of the this series, so I am slightly biased when i say I give this game a 8/10, given how long I've been wanting to play this. However, if your'e someone new, and only recently played the first one, this will probably be more of a 6 or 7/10.",1.0

This game is fun and very cute to look at, but several things about it are clunky and frustrating.

The tech tree is kind of bizarre, without much sense of logic to it. For instance, you research submarines before you can make boats. There also doesn't seem to be any way to put a chick in a hen coop. An arbitrary line pops into existence when you have gone out too far in a given type of boat and it just feels kind of jarring. Space is weirdly limited, and undersea is very plain. You can make steel well before you can make bronze and scuba stations before you can make hay.

The main pain point though is the inability to assign settlers to some of the buildings, such as grills and charcoal burners, and their disinterest in picking up resources from nets or storing them after production. Hopefully these will be addressed soon.

I would say it's worth buying if only because it seems to have a lot of potential and is fun even given some frustrations.",1.0

Some things to note:
- There isn't a breakdown of why stability is low. I would prefer if there is a menu where it says something like: ""this city has low stability because such and such.""
- Political power does nothing at the moment
- You don't get a breakdown of how much resources are being produced. If I build a bakery or a farm, I want to know how much wheat is being produced per day or week.
- Diplomacy is too simple at the moment. There is no option to join an a war an ally is in. You also can't call in an ally to your war.
- This is a personal preference, but there isn't a good way to optimize production of resources. You can select the option to send resources weekly to a city, but you'd have to do it for every single city. Maybe an option where it just sorts resources by itself would be better.

Highly Recommend if you like good NSFW CG and horror thriller gameplay.  Game's pretty good at trying to nerve wrack the players.

Obviously it's a horror game so the enemy will only be stunned to give players time to run and will never truly be defeated.

The puzzle part of the platforming is still decent but seems to be less of a focus then the original or is at least easier in that aspect. The focus seems to be more on the platforming side of puzzle platformers, since the new upgrades and changes focus on it more. Only other complaint of something specific would be that the boss before you get your last upgrade was too simple and could easily be beaten in less than 10 seconds, making it pointless to even have gameplay wise.

244,137211919,2321210,"This game is great but there a lot of QOL issues that break immersion, here are my issues.....

#1 Identity

This game is advertised as a rouge-like but it also has the most half-4ssed rhythm aspect that I have ever seen. Basically every 4 beats if you hit on-beat your 2nd attack does a little more damage... and that's the entire rhythm aspect of the game and because of this the game has awful repetitive music to keep you on beat. As a result of this there is also an beat indicator that is very hard to see and makes it hard to play and look at the same time and because every beat sounds the same you have to look at it, it really ruins the experience.

-I feel like they should completely remove this feature add better music and just add a cool-down instead

#2 English dub 

its clearly an AI which is not bad but its done horribly, Its almost like they fed a Language model every anime girl dub to ever exist and then tossed a Chinese and a Australian person in there for good measure and it ruined everything. (it sounds like a Chinese person speaking Engrish-Australian sometimes)

#3 Grammar

I have no clue what I am reading sometimes

#4 video settings

-No anti-aliasing

-If you set the game to windowed mode you cant move the window around and its stuck in 
the center of your monitor 
(whats the point then????) 

-Display mode does not work properly, border-less and windowed get each other mixed up 
sometimes.

-No proper window scaling it is a fixed 16:9 

-Graphics quality appears to do absolutely nothing





Conclusion: I will come back when it is more polished :)",1.0
245,137211771,1669980,"Overall, I really enjoy this game. If you liked My Life as a Teenage Exocolonist or Long Live the Queen you'll probably have a good time with this. It has a lot of content, I'd say I like it more that Long Live the Queen. Not nearly as much as My Life as a Teenage Exocolonist for a few reasons. There are several problems that you may or may not be able to overlook.

Most noticeably, the translations are CRUNCHY. It's not really a problem for most of the game, you can pretty easily get the gist of what was meant. Once you get in to later story stuff for the true ending it gets pretty difficult to understand, to the point that I'm wondering if there are some sequence breaks I found accidentally.

There are also two pretty severe and consistent game breaking bugs. First and foremost are the gift letters you receive. These will lock the game up every single time you try to open one. Fortunately they aren't really a necessary part of the game, they're mostly for flavor. Second is a save data corruption bug that can happen if you have cloud saves enabled. As of the version I'm playing (1.00.00 I think) the devs even have it in the announcements with instructions for how to turn off cloud saves. There are also a number of other bugs that are less consistent, e.g. I once had to force quit when I got stuck in the horse capturing event.

There is still a lot to be desired, but just with the bare bones this game has to offer it's already worth putting some hours in to it. It's a challenging game but not over punishing. The mechanics are simple are enough, but enjoyable and have enough depth. I would love to see some quality of life added to logistics, and inventory urgently.

But overall, I happy with the systems they have implemented and excited to see what they add, they are really creating a solid foundation.

I would recommend buying since it's already fun to play, and do get your $30 worth already, and I would love to see what this project could do with more funding.

Playing in full screen causes issues with the font choice in game. (Guess it mostly just affects the tutorial)
Terrible font choice. Bad translation. Really hard to read.

First play through, got to day 4, not sure why the police alert kept going higher.

Got to court, hit ""Start"" without using the slot machine, lose. Okay.

Second play through. Pretty much game over on day 1. All of my guys failed their missions. Couldn't proceed. Restart.

Get hit by random event cards. Cant find the ""Discard random event"" card. 
Game punishes you for... playing the game. So if you get a bad event card and its going to get filled, just stop playing cards and let the day end. Seems like bad design where the best move is to stop playing.

Clicking on the cards is very clunky. After clicking one, mouse is locked out for 2 seconds before you can click another card.

Also they absolutely ruined the game by tying the puzzle challenges to progression. The old version where you could just progress by doing dungeons was much better. The new kingdom stuff is terrible.

266,137214343,2089500,"Honest Reviews

Pros
1) The 2d visual & soundtracks are great.
2) Figuring out what the right card to use on each event/fight is fun (the first time around). 
    For example, Giving away a herb or an upside-down herb will result in a different out come.
    Using water card to interupt enemy fire spell. Using fire card on the Fool when he is drinking to set him on fire.
3) Eventhough it has no major effect on the gameplay I like how each children has their own unique characteristic & 
     interactions.
4) Base Upgrade Feature (in which doesn't last very long...)
    
Cons
Despite having some fun mechanics such as parry & elemental counterplay, the core gameplay end up being just spamming attack & heal cards ez win. I actually don't mind a game being too easy but the lack of new enemy variety & event make later runs kinda dull. For example, the Whale, Oarfish & Jellyfish all share the same attack pattern despite looking completly different.",1.0

Stop leaving false information on reviews about the game being Pay To Win. Currently there is no Pay to Win mechanic in the game. Buying any of the packs grants you the same gameplay experience. Buying the Ultimate pack will only grant you 2-3 additional racers which you can also buy shards for from the shop when they become available. None of the come fully upgraded or something, everything level 1. 

The additional currency received from the pack? Sure is good to burn it all on the lootboxes like an idiot to get that extra shard you need. But you can also wait for the shards to become available in shops. The additional tokens for the boxes? Is it really pay to win if you open 3 extra boxes? 

Stop with the pay to win crap because this is not the case, the game does not require you any additional payments after you bough the game, you can't buy currency with real money, you just grind it like a normal person. But you open lootboxes for that extra shard because you want to upgrade NOW instead of waiting for an event that gives shards or to become available in the shop. 

Maybe you think there are few racers now, but the roster grows with every season (same with the tracks) The sense of speed is not enough? Come into a multiplayer race with me, I'll bash and stun you so fast, you will pray to the devs to make the game slower xD.

299,137276470,2207490,"Feels pretty good but definitely could use some more of the ""idle"" aspect injected. Or at the very least more player friendly calculations for idling when closed down.

Pretty fun Min/Max Idler that doesn't really just idle because once you make one change there are some strange feeling calculations that throw everything off, and if you Leave the game(close it) for it to idle and then you come back, something happens with the calculations that causes a lot of stuff to go wonky causing you to have to reallocate resources even though while the game was running in the background everything was pretty self sustaining, guessing it has to do with the ""Game continues to run but at 25% efficiency"" mode?

Overall pretty enjoyable but the constant reallocation/min/maxing after closing it is VERY annoying to come back to, as you don't just grab your upgrades and continue enjoying your production/supply lines. Also some upgrades you grab causes your supply lines to go haywire(which is fine in some cases because if you grab faster harvesting that's obviously going to strain your cultivation/prospecting supply lines so you WOULD need to adjust that accordingly) but at times I feel very discouraged from grabbing an ""upgrade"" because then I get to spend the next 10+ minutes re-allocating every resouce(primarily grains/animal feed/culvitation of grain/WATER because water doesn't feel like it scales well and Wells themselves get expensive very quickly) just to get back to nornal functionality.",1.0

316,137278250,1928420,"Personally, no. 

Cons : 
Unable to change keybinds (your skill is binded to C, and if you're like me who uses C to crouch, you're SOL)
Unable to change screen resolution
Unable to change FOV (This and the previous point is a big issue if you're playing Ultrawide like me. Can't see a damn thing close range)
Unable to change your graphics (PROPERLY for PC other than presets)
Horrible matchmaking (have fun getting matched with high ranked players as a newbie)
No tutorial if you link your mobile account (have fun exploring what buttons does what because there's no keybinds)

Pros : 
Graphics are nice. Pretty much Overwatch-tier. Cute characters, easily marketable and monetisable.
BOOTY GALORE
Idk, it's your average battle royale? It's pretty good. It's more vehicle combat focused though. So combine that with Apex/Overwatch type skills and you got one hell of a balancing act. 

The game is fun, but bugs and weird design choices on PC just makes this a Not Recommended for me. They clearly just ported over their mobile layout to PC and didn't really give a damn to their PC players. I've played their mobile version, and it's alright. Movement is SUPER slow to entice you use their movement skills feature. Which may or may not be a good thing for some. 

I really wonder why they ported this to PC if they're not gonna make basic PC design choices.

К сожалению, подобные истории всё-таки генерирует игрок, а большая часть контента в игре повторяется. От процедурно сгенеририованного мира всё-таки хочется немного большего. Потенциал есть, игра формально в раннем доступе. Посмотрим, что будет.

325,137276865,986130,"A very complex & difficult game to learn.
Finding people & aligning evidence with actual locations & using said locations where people live or even work can't be used as a way to find potential evidence as in most cases the people that work at these locations don't appear on their own security feeds making it impossible to identify a person or trace down a missing person if more than one person lives in an apartment where someone was killed which was the case for me.

I ran around for 4 hours trying to find a person with no avail. 
Even the tutorial fails to teach you how to play this game properly.
And simple ""steal this"" tasks don't give you a location to go steal stuff either, just the building but not the location specifically.
So if you walk into an apartment complex that has 1500 apartment within the complex itself; then good luck trying to find which place it is you're looking for.

Interesting premise but fails to deliver.",0.0
326,137276733,986130,"Honestly, no notes. This is an amazing experience. It does what it says on the tin, procedural murders to solve. It's a tough nut to crack for sure but it's a lot of fun. 

I am worried that the loop will get stale overtime but I've only played the intro case so far for about 2hrs so I haven't really had a chance to discover how the game keeps things fresh over time or what the ""end game"" is, if there is one.

I will say that sometimes the controls and UI feel a little clunky, would really love to see a mouse wheel scroll for inventory switching. But if thats my biggest complaint, I'd say this is a very solid early access game. Highly recommend you check this out for yourself, if you like 80s cyberpunk bladerunner style, mysteries, or just want to try something new this game is for you.",1.0
327,137276683,986130,"I wish Steam had a middle option between Recommend and Not Recommend at times like these. 

There's an incredibly strong and fun foundation to this game, but unfortunately for now the systems fall short in providing an interesting or engaging challenge, at least once you've done the first case (the tutorial one). I suspect that once it exits early access it'll definitely be worth picking up, but as is I can't really recommend it.

Performance issues and bugs aside, I think my biggest issue is just that it doesn't really feel like you're a detective, not even a private one that doesn't have to follow the rule of law to get answers. The side missions all have you doing straight up criminal stuff which wouldn't be a big deal if there was anything *other* than criminal things for you to do. You can't even legally enter a murder scene to investigate it since it counts as trespassing, so even if you're trying to do things ""by the book"", the game just won't let you and you have to break into the apartment anyways. Once you break in though, you basically have free reign to move stuff around, jump, sprint, whatever, no one will come in.

Even something tiny like letting you enter a building if you have a warrant, or chatting up the cops a bit to let you into the scene, small stuff like that would already be a huge improvement, because as it is right all you do is either sneak in through unguarded vents (that no one cares about you entering) or you just lockpick the door and walk in.

The game needs more avenues for gaining access to everything from buildings to information. More fleshed out dialogue options, better info gathering minigames like emails that actually tell you anything useful, recording incriminating conversations from vents, just little details like that, just like the detective media you presumably enjoy considering you're looking at this game in the first place.

Aside from that, the UI/UX is pretty rough as well, I hope a lot of love is put towards that. As is, everything is an information black hole, you can't even find your own address or access your own computer in your own apartment, you just need to memorize/ write it down somewhere.

I'll be keeping a close eye on this one, because I really want it to succeed and genuinely hope that it does.",0.0

- The art is amazing.
- The music is great.
- So far combat is good, the controls are good, and you get a forward dash early on, i liked that.
- There is a bit of weapon variety, I have now a sword, a whip, a great sword and a scythe. I am a bit hammer fan, i doubt i will find one in this game, be nice though.
- You have a selection of 3 languages for the voicing, English, Japanese and Chinese.
- This is a huge plus for me: Renee does not talk stupid crap every time you press a button, I wholeheartedly loathe that recent practice in games to make characters talk your ears off with regarded, cringy voice lines. Thanks a lot Aurogon for not doing that crap.

335,137276757,1074190,"I've only just started, so keep that in mind as I review this. If you see my playtime go up, I'm probably enjoying it.

You awake to a world of not-Pokemon, where everything is a Dragon and soaked in a air of Isekai-MC webnovel. Yes, I'm deadly serious. If you read Chinese cultivation novels-without-the-cultivation, you'll know exactly what I mean. If that alone gets your brain tingling, just buy it. Moving on, you figure out that your name is Chang Junwai, protag and Dragon Trainer, that is just another Tamer Student like many others. No, you cannot name your character. Yes, there is a reason for that. 

He's not a silent protagonist either. This matters more than you think.

Straight off, getting it out the way, this is a RPG-Maker game that you wouldn't know was a RPG-Maker game if you didn't pay attention to a few small tilesets and minor music pieces that are quite common in RPG-maker titles. However, that is where that all ends. When I said you wouldn't know unless you knew those things by memory, I meant it. Graphical wise, the artwork and style choice for the whole game is beautiful. Seriously, it's extraordinarily pretty and the looks for the characters alone are so sleek.

Try saving your game. Just do it. Yeah. Doesn't feel like a RPG-Maker game anymore, does it?

Just look at the screenshots. LOOK at those designs. They are everywhere and it's stunning. However, this can also be a fault. This is everywhere in the game and I can't believe I'm saying this, but many of the creatures in the game look so overly well-crafted that you start to get conflicted about just how well designed they are. Think about it in terms of Pokemon. You have have Pidgey, Pikachu and then Lugia. Every creature looks Lugia-level, when they could be a Pikachu, or a mere Pidgey. 

How you feel about that will depend on up to you as a player, but it was something that I got a little annoyed about after awhile. I still like them, but things are less cool when everything is cool. Thankfully, this is just looks and many of the creatures do feel different.

Battle wise? Your monsters have four moves, SP and a charging ATB gauge that tells you when you can use a move. Your opponent will not wait for you, so be ready to pop the move you want and think ahead. Or just hit thing until everything dies because honestly, you all know how creature collector games go. It's only as hard as you make it to be. You'll always have the chance to level up, train or just laugh at foolish NPC's thinking they stand a chance.

I'd spoil more but honestly, the more you progress the deeper the systems start to go. For something that is less expensive than a meal at McDonalds, it's extremely impressive what a brand new creator has done here. I'm both stunned by the effort and the desire to keep playing that I have.

At this point I had to turn off the music--that's my only gripe with this game--the music is a short loop so quite repetitious and too ""upbeat"" (drums and flutes) for my taste.

It's pretty abstract and atmospheric (environments are huge in size), but what stands out the most is the involved combat system with switching colors and parries (of the matching color!) filling out ability bar. It's got the regular jump, dodge, parry, attack, ability etc... The dodge must happen right when the opponent connects so you have to watch them.  It's got a pretty interesting progression system.  If you are into timings and quick reflexes this is your game...  I enjoy this kind of stuff.  If you are into invincible roll dodging everywhere and spamming the fast attack button on everything that moves play dark souls I guess this is not it...  

this game doesn't also seem to have a convoluted tedious ""story"" associated with it which I also appreciate, I just enjoy the atmosphere but people who need to be led by the nose through some ""interesting story"" should go back to Elden Ring

The Mageseeker is a top-down pixel-stylized action-adventure RPG. Set in the League of Legends world of Runeterra, it explores the journey of convict traitor Sylas as he seeks to free mages from tyranny and change Demacia’s mindset of their second-class citizens. Your primary enemies are the Mageseekers, an oppressive policing force that arrests and prosecutes mages simply for existing regardless of whether they’re guilty or innocent of any crime. Although the country of Demacia displays itself as righteous and just, the Mageseekers are the corrupted cancerous sore just underneath the skin. 
	Combat consists of beating mageseekers and wild animals to a pulp, stealing their magic and turning it against them. It’s constantly engaging, pushing you from fight to fight. The puzzles that present themselves in between are pretty basic, but not horribly so. 
The most interesting thing about this game is the story, if you care at all about the League of Legends universe. The struggles of Sylas and his allies are endearing. The strife of Jarvan the 4th suddenly becoming king is on full display, showing that a young man with minimal idea of how to lead anyone probably shouldn’t be the right guy to head an entire country. I don’t want to give any spoilers, but League players will get a kick out of the cameos and enjoy the characters interwoven into major roles, especially the revelations of Demacia and the truths it attempts to conceal.

Pros

o	Fun combat that keeps you on your toes
o	The variety of options that the magic and ultimate system gives you
o	The characters, minor and major
o	The story
o	The platforming in certain combat engagements keeps you moving, forcing you to thoroughly think before jumping in head first
o	The graphical stylizations are an enjoyable choice
o	Most of the bosses are pretty awesome, offering interesting and evolving mechanics.
o	You can edit the difficulty to your liking, like increasing enemy HP and damage or reducing Sylas’ HP and damage. You can adjust this difficulty on the fly as well, which is very nice if you feel like the game is too easy or too hard.

Cons

o	Various bugs, both visual and audio are present. Especially in the later game.
o	Its pretty short, only clocking in at about 20-22 hours depending on how well you do at some  boss fights.
o	Enemy AI will sometimes just break, resulting in them just standing their not casting spells or attacking.
o	Some enemies will just be invincible for no reason.
o	Some boss fights feel too full of AoE, causing them to feel unfair.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

	I played the game on hard mode, which increases enemy health and damage. I didn’t reduce Sylas’ HP or damage, or this game would’ve taken forever. 
At the end of the day, I would give this game about an 8.5/10. Its quite fun, aside from certain frustrating sections. I think it’s definitely worth a playthrough. The caveat is that I don’t think it’s worth $30. I’d recommend waiting for a sale. The Deluxe addition really isn’t worth it unless you just want to support the devs.

I do wish some of the mechanics worked better, for instance, I never felt the need to use a banana as there was always a better option. The bee hives were too abundant and made a lot of the sections much easier than they otherwise could have been.

217,137187103,1434540,"Zoeti is a game that, if you are a fan of roguelite deckbuilders(Slay the Spire, Roguebook, Inscryption, etc) is a must try. But make no mistake, this is game is a strategy game just as much as it is a roguelite deckbuilder. Relying on combinations of cards and keeping track of what you have in your hand as well as your upcoming draws is crucial to the gameplay. 

Gameplay: 

You do not build a deck, but rather you build the array of abilities you can use by having specific combinations of cards from a deck made of traditional playing cards. This feels a bit unfamiliar compared to other games in the genre, but once you figure it out, it works well. Combat encounters feel very hit or miss, you will one shot an elite encounter and then the very next encounter be completely helpless. This is partially the nature of roguelites, but at the same time this feels very extreme and very unforgiving.

Story:
The story, if you are interested, has a lot of depth, however having a story that you repeatedly try to complete and start from scratch after each failed run makes the runs feel a little monotonous. I wanted to skip dialogue, but there are a lot of times where in the middle of 20+ dialogue panels you get to make decisions on gaining specific items so you feel like you can't skip anything.

Pros: 

- The actual gameplay is simple enough to pick up and understand, you don't need to understand poker to understand this
- There is a surprising amount of depth in how you manipulate your hand to succeed, and when you can properly manage your hand turn to turn it feels very satisfying
- The soundtrack is fantastic
- The game is visually very well polished, and accomplishes exactly what it is trying to do

Cons:

- The tutorial is a bit of an information dump, most people will do better just jumping right in if they have prior experience with the genre rather than trying to read everything and understand what it is saying
- This is not a good intro game to roguelike deckbuilders, there is enough complexity that you would be better playing something more straightforward to understand the genre and then coming back to this.


Zoeti can be very unforgiving, especially if you do not understand the values of offence and defense and how to balance them in your abilities. If you are a fan of a challenge and roguelite deckbuilders, this game is for you. If you have never played a roguelite deckbuilder before, then look somewhere else, and if you enjoy it, then come back here. You won't regret it.",1.0

1) being stuck the letter opening screen and unable to get out without restarting the whole game (and potentially losing all my game progress for that month)
2) being unable to advance my knight quests at all upon receiving them throughout the duration of the entire game
3) my stats suddenly spiking way up or down after completing an exploration
4) visual bugs where if I skip a cutscene it overlays on top of another cutscene anyways and both voices in the cutscene go at once
5) (not a bug but bad feature) Having enemies ""cast a spell"" when I'm exploring that doesn't tell me what they are going to do. I lost several runs that way in the last exploration area.

272,137192836,1860510,"[h1]Not at all like Mount and Blade, more like grand Strategy meets Call to Arms[/h1]

Mount & Blade is first and foremost an RPG, you play as a character, you raise said character stats, and all the game interactions depend on that character and it's standing with the kingdom or other characters, including controlling armies either strategically or tactically, and any diplomacy or settlement management options. [b]Total Conflict: Resistance[/b] doesn't have you controlling a single character, but a whole faction, including it's economy, diplomacy and armies, in a real time grand strategy map, and then you can take control of any soldier or vehicle under your command in real time tactical battles. It's more like a lighter real time Grand Strategy that allows you to control battles in a RTS/FPS hybrid way, think a lighter Realpolitiks meets Call to Arms.

The game is on it's early steps and has a [b]long[/b] way to go. I'd avoid purchasing so early unless you're willing to take the risk, as many promising early access titles get dropped halfway. But I'm confident the good reception will fuel the development of the game to fulfill it's potential. It is, in many ways, a new genre, so it gets extra points for that.

[B]The bad[/b]

The game has a long way to go. The FPS part needs polish, particularly the vehicle control needs a bunch of fine tuning. The RTS part of the game might be the blandest, you need more options in the way you order your units, like advance either seeking cover or assaulting a position, telling your troops to go prone, maybe different formations, etc. The RTS is very bare bones in that aspect.

The production and tech trees are all over the place, and make little sense, they need to be polished and better explained. You can make convoys to build complex production lines (a city makes a raw resource, a second city refines it, a third one makes weapons out of it), but you could do with better production and convoy control (a panel where I can see and tweak what my cities build, what they produce and need, and my programmed convoys).

The story (so far) is funny yet bland, clichéd, but it allows you to play NATO vs Warsaw Pact equipment and tech trees, which is what I'm here for. There are ""anarchist"" or ""rebel"" factions, and you can start as one but I don't recommend it as you'll loose the little tutorial there is and it's a harder start [spoiler]and they are not ideological anarchist, just anarchists in the lax use of the word[/spoiler]. For some reason the character names seem drawn from a bucket, and don't fit the setting, that speaks of European and Slavic populations.

You can manage the equipment your squads have, but that part needs tons of polish. I'd like the devs to take inspiration from Hearts of Iron, where you could design your squads to a standard, and then the logistics in the game will try to match it. At the moment, you can ""design"" squads in a separate screen with weapons you don't have available, and then you won't be able to build them. ""Uniforms"" are used as an abstraction for ""training"", as you'll be able to raise as many soldiers or militias as you have uniforms, and that's Ok, I guess, but could be better explained in game.

Models and graphics also need a lot of work, ""standard"" troops look more like PMC than like regular army soldiers. Rebels also look more like PMC than like civilians that took up arms. I'd like to see more 1980's NATO or Warsaw Pact uniforms and gear. Also, for some reason, you get desert fatigues but I haven't seen any desert on the map. On the 2D graphics side, the portraits could use a little touch-up, some of the anarchists don't look like rebels at all. The flags could use a lot of work, you have a ""communist"" flag with a fleu-de-Lis (a French aristocratic symbol), really, use flags that look like the former Yugoslavia or DDR, with red stars or ""symbols of work"", please. None of the anarchists flags has a circled A.

Music is absolutely bland and forgettable.

You don't have female soldiers, which is [b]an error[/b] I expect the devs to fix, since women have been fighting in wars since antiquity and are fighting at wars today, so it's really just not realistic not to have 10-20% female troops. More so since both ""communism"" and ""democracy"" (the opposing ideologies in this game) believe in women rights.

I don't get to play a lot of video games these days. Not really a bad thing, life is better when you're busier, and Sleeper Games titles are experiences I would be loathe to miss out on. This one is coming out of pre-release with a LOT of polish and interface work completed, and prior builds from Itch.io can be reviewed if a body's interested in getting some of that alpha flavor for background. Nice how some games have that going for them: this one is such a game. Good developers, good aesthetic, and an excellent community of players and makers to get in touch with on the ol' Discord there. For a pizza-money price, you're getting what could amount to hundreds of hours of entertainment, wrapped in an aesthetic which has not been matched by any other game creator's titles. It's an [b]experience[/b].

[b][i]If you're checking this game out without having seen any other Sleeper Games titles[/i][/b]: this game is ""Genesis/SNES-era Metal Gear with Spaceships in the Atmosphere of a Gas Giant, And You Have Done Drugs"". There is a story, and you'll get bits and pieces of it via roguelite-esque missions. The interface for purchasing and equipping gear is fairly unique, and you may enjoy or hate it, depending on how willing you are to try a new experience.

There are parts of this game that will grate, and parts that will be smoother than you'd imagined possible, and there will be exploits from combinations of certain items and weapons. Some of these things will be emergent, some will be built in, I've enjoyed both playing this game without any tutorials *and* playing the tutorials, which are decent, and somewhat challenging to follow and complete. It's a difficult game, you'll quit out of frustration at least once if you're anything like a normal person, and it's still way easier than a lot of games out there. Like a lot of stealth games, there is a puzzle aspect to its action, and combat will have its ups and downs.

[b][i]If you're checking this out after having quickly glanced at the other Sleeper Games titles[/i][/b]: this game is a stealth game rendered in a style similar to ---Red---Tether-->, with a more forgiving twitch-gameplay aspect in its combat, less tether related mechanics, and the aggregated benefit of Sleeper Games's experience from developing their prior titles. Gameplay for this title is very, very distinguished from that in Hyperspace Dogfights, still holds some similarities in certain mechanics though.

[b][i]If you're checking this out after having played and hated the other Sleeper Games titles[/i][/b]: figure it out, lol, what are you doing here?

[b][i]If you're checking this out after having played and enjoyed the other Sleeper Games titles[/i][/b]: also lol, leave a review too, and this game implements some great stuff from each prior game.

From my own steady experience with those titles and this one, and from having witnessed some of the pre-release and alpha build forms for this and ---Red---Tether--->, this is already looking like a final-product, and despite that it almost certainly guaranteed to continue to get updates with more content for at least the next several months, and potentially over the course of the next few years.",1.0

289,137193765,1967630,"After my first time playing, I immediately see a huge problem with this game: base management. One of the first things you do in a survival crafting game is survey resources available in an area and decide where to put your base. However, in this game, resources take a long time to regenerate, so you will either have to constantly move your base, or travel further and further for resources (and that doesn't include how much the story quests move you around the map). With the very limited and restrictive movement/carry weight system (you stop completely dead if you are even .1 overweight, which I would suggest a change to maybe 75% movement speed reduction and unable to jump or run, when you are overloaded).

An overlooked possible feature of this game, right at the start, is salvaging the debris from your ship... Like, you see pieces of it all over, but can't do ANYTHING with it.
It's a mountainous island that you start on right? WHY ARE ROCKS SO RARE?

---------------------------------------------------
Long, slightly unstructured version:

The gameplay is enjoyable enough, although you are completely fine for the most part just ignoring the counter element system and the additional moves your allies give you even on the highest difficulty, which is such a shame. Its fun to go through the missions, cool to see your base progress, but nothing too fancy overall.
Sadly, the gameplay is brought down by the low variety in locations and layouts. And while enemy variety is good, the supposed ""strongest variant"" of most elements feel like less of a threat than their weaker allies, which again is a shame. The variety of spells is nice tho, especially that not all of them are simple damage spells.

Sadly, the story is utterly unremarkable as a mixture of tropes you can see coming from 10 miles away. This would be fine with compelling characters, but I feel that they are also very one-note and cannot carry the story even for its short runtime of around 12 hours (if you complete everything). It also gets vexxing very quickly how the ending to most main story boss fights are handled. And this is such a shame, as the premise has such promise, which is sometimes tapped into ever so slightly, mostly in notes, but wasted for the most part.

The presentation feels a little off. The music is great and the art can look good, especially enemies, but looks silly too many times in dialogue and things like the base walking animation. Which can be ignored during combat so this is a minor issue. What cannot be ignored are the awkward cuts, sometimes not loading cutscenes, etc. Visual clarity is great however. (My complaints might be a product of my general dislike of most pixel art, so take with a grain of salt.)

Overall my issues can be boiled down to too little for too much money. This game is not worth its full price, not to mention the terrible launch-day DLC which locks additional spells behind your wallet. And this tainted my entire experience. Get it on a discount of at least 50% for some light entertainment, don't get it for the story.",0.0

I think most people used to Minecraft will call this game boring due to it being action strategy but i think it is actually quite nice being a little bit more hands off and leading troops instead of doing everything yourself, it gives you a wider picture to be able to take on larger scale battles more effectively. The beginning of the game hand hold you through the first main battle and after that its pretty much open world, this is basically a redundant second tutorial to teach you how to actually play the game past simple mechanics and even though its a little annoying at the start i think its needed since this is a radical change in genre.

And I was scared diving in this at first (example is I approached a wrecked ship out at sea and heard the hunted death music come on and a shark swimming towards the surface near my canoe… my IRL heart rate increased I started to sweat and I took my canoe and got the hell outta there… then I turned back after calming down and decided I will no longer let video game sea predators scare me… I have 2 shark head trophies mounted on my walls of my main camp 🤣🤣🤣)  and harpooning a shark and dorados. Diving for sea resources would have all been skipped but fear has been conquered and I dive each time i play. I already have 30 hours in 5 days… I love everything about this game.

Additionally, there are some bugs as it is a newer game, one which was just created which is causing a pretty big deficit in the game, but hopefully it will be resolved soon. Once it is, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes Princess Maker type games.",1.0

377,137201282,1457080,"I wish I could've liked this game more, but there are a few shortcomings that it has that make it really unfun for me. I really enjoyed the pixel art of this game and I think the story is interesting for someone who doesn't really pay attention to that stuff, but when it comes to the gameplay I feel a bit disappointed. 

The dash feels annoying and kinda of works against you alot of the times. Maybe its because I've been graced with other games with different dash mechanics but this one feels sluggish and gets you stuck on objects quite often. I wondered if this was part of the difficulty in the game because this dash SUCKS. 

Another thing that bothers me is the checkpoints. I think the checkpoints are pretty distant to where you last died and it makes it a hassle having to walk over to where you last were instead of just being at the entrance near the place you died. And in my opinion, this especially becomes more evident when you do the side missions of this game, where part of those stages gives you choice of which powerful unique spell you can get. After making your choice and proceeding into the next room, let's say you die. Now I have to go BACK to that last shrine where I made my choice, make my decision AGAIN, and then dash back to that room to start all over. Personally I feel that if you made that chose to begin with, then the player should commit to that spell continuing forward. The argument could be made that maybe a different spell could lead to a better outcome and different ways to tackle those challenges, and in that i would understand. I think I just don't like it.

The cutscenes, the CUTSCENES, can be very tedious and unbearable if they are present before a boss fight or phase. If I lose in a bossfight that has cutscenes before it, you know damn well I am going to have to sit through all that text and animations AGAIN to get straight to the fight. You have the option to ""fast forward"" these cutscenes instead of a skip button to get to the fight which is just weird. And honestly I don't think this fast forward button makes the animations before a boss fight go faster, I think they just stay the same speed but I'm not too sure. It just makes text go faster which is just okay. It becomes a habit that I've come to see during play that makes it hard to overlook. 

And the last thing I should mention is some of the malpractices other reviewers have come to notice as well. Like disabling spells behind a paywall that you can't get otherwise. I found that out late after I preordered the game and I just find it wrong. 

I really like what they were going here. I enjoy Sylas as a character and I think the game has some wonderful and special charm to it given its story and art, I just wouldn't recommend it right now. I will still continue to play it since I like the champion personally and I guess I just like to suffer, but I'm not sure how long it will last. Hopefully in the future they will update this game with quality of life changes and then I will see myself playing it more.

There are a few things that sort of make the experience a bit less immersive or polished as it should be.

Combat is what you expect in the souls-like genre with easy-to-understand dodge and parry system. The finishing moves are satisfying as well. 

The skill system rewards experimentation with other weapons but at the same time, it doesn't reward those who just want to stay with a specific weapon. A skill tree refresh in a future DLC could be most welcome here.

Is it work playing? I think if you enjoyed watching Elden Ring through streams and videos but thought it was to difficult to enjoy yourself, you might enjoy this approach. The story is entertaining and the voice talent is quite good.

421,137203482,1663220,"UNMARKED SPOILERS FOR COFFEE TALK 1
If there was a 'neutral' option I'd pick that. 

I played the first Coffee Talk because I wanted an experience like va11halla. The game ultimately disappointed me quite a bit but I could see the potential in it and I was looking forward to giving this one a try. 

The mechanics and story beats between the two games are largely very similar. This one has a few more drinks and the ability to give items to patrons. Honestly I strongly recommend playing this game with a guide. Replaying days to get drink orders correct is a pain in the ass due to the fast-forward feature not actually fast-forwarding through character animations and the like, and the expanded menu and choices mean little in terms of branching plot content. The good options are objectively more interesting and satisfying than the bad ones (at least from what I experienced).

The story and character selection has somewhat improved as well. I found Freya from the first game to be fairly obnoxious due to her constant meta conversations about stories and narratives. Glad to say that she's pretty much gone. The new characters aren't the best and some of the storylines are utter bores, but at least there's nobody in the cast I hate. 

In my review of coffee talk 1 I expressed my disdain for Lua and Baileys' story and the very forced allegory to racism and inter-cultural marriage. A lot of people mistook this as me hating the game's 'SJW agenda' or something but I have no problem with games tackling contemporary political issues. The reason it was such a bad storyline is because it failed to be interesting within the context of its own world. See, coffee talk has this problem where it gets so caught up in allegories and dialogue that it seems to forget that it is supposed to be a game in its own world. Succubi and elves have no obvious cultural differences. Any historical context simply isn't mentioned. The language they use to talk about their conflict far too strongly resembles the language of our world despite Bailey and Lua literally being different species. I know this isn't Coffee Talk 1 but this tangent applies to the alien storyline in Coffee Talk 2. 

Between the talk about being accepted, changing your appearance and pronouns to better fit with who you are, and coming out to the person you're dating. Silver (previously Neil) is a somewhat obvious allegory for gender identity issues. However when the allegory is this intentional, it starts becoming a little weird that your stand-in for a trans person is literally an alien being pursued by the men-in-black because... well actually they never give us a good reason why. It's like this story was written as an allegory first and a story in the world of coffee talk second. However this story comes across as extra bizarre because Silver and the other alien spend a lot of time teaching you about the nature of their species. If you remember the reveal from the first game, you literally are one of these aliens. Why are they telling you all this? 

Coffee Talk really has a tendency to use most of its dialogue for the benefit of the player while sacrificing more organic conversation. Gala and Hyde remind you explicitly of their long lifespans multiple times. Why? Your player character has talked to them a fuckload of times. This should be common knowledge. It's like if you asked a Chinese bloke what he had for lunch and he told you ""I had a delicious bowl of white rice, the staple crop of us Chinese, which I ate with chopsticks, the cutlery of choice for many Chinese folk."" It's bizarre and immersion-breaking. 

Even Jorji's storyline about the mysterious spooky vandalism cases has shades of this. Some of the conversations very quickly stop feeling like conversations and start feeling like a Wikipedia page written in casual speech. 

Although I just spent several paragraphs shitting on the game, it's not all bad. The newer sprite work is subtly but noticeably an improvement. The first game's art was fine, but some sprites looked more like low-res paintings than active uses of pixel art. Coffee Talk 2's sprites lean a lot more into the pixel art aesthetics. In some places such as the sprites of the drinks, and pictures on the social media app, the improvements are a lot more obvious. 

A lot of the casual conversations in this game unrelated to the main plot threads have very strong character building. Lua and Hyde specifically get fleshed out a lot in this game, and are much better for it. Rachel was one of the stronger characters from the 1st game and although she only shows up here and there, she's still a lot of fun in this one. The new characters do manage to have their share of interesting moments as well. 

In spite of everything, I do think this is an improvement over Coffee Talk 1. If you liked the first one, I am certain you will like this one. But I still think it is too flawed to earnestly recommend.",0.0

Combat, which is the core aspect of the game is just miserable though.

I personally don't really like Souls-likes and i grew tired of the copycats.

Stray Blade however can't even copy that combat system properly. Dodging works alright but parrying feels like luck rather than skill. Fights turn into ""hit, dodge, repeat"" chores, paired with poor animations. It feels like a Piranha Bytes game...Just not fun and downright broken and janky.

This would've been so much better with an action combat system, like Amalur etc. When i play video games i want to have fun, not get annoyed by a bad combat system. Sad but i have to downvote it. At least until they change it to something better/playable. Would've recmmended it otherwise.",0.0

430,137203928,2321210,"I will divide the review in two parts. How i feel the character evolves, and how diverse the biomes are.

[b]Character progression:[/b]
Meta Progression:

There's three main aspect to it. Friendship trinkets, departements and the evolution tree. Yeah it's not the official names but honestly it simpler to name them this way for now.

So the trinkets are basically passives that improves a few stats, specific elements, or could give you more gold during a run. I feel these are fine, killing 20 lords is a bit too much for the last level requirement but overall i feel they do their jobs and are a good way to evolve your character during a run and you get them relatively quickly up to the current cap (outside of elemental ones because you could kill the 20 lords with them all in the current build).

The Departments are also relatively fine in term of progress speed, outside of the ressource you only seem to get from Lord kills but no real complaints. I'm only missing like three upgrades and it's mostly about 20 left to grind. These are mostly upgrade that adds some options during a run. The effects are small but noticeable. I'm a big fan of the one that adds a rhapsody option at the very start of the run but more about this later. Again, no real complaints here.

The evolution tree are basically stat upgrades or buffs that will impact your character directly, such as more damage, some initial goal, an extra life, more health and more. These are the boring kind of upgrades but i will not complain about my distate of this kind of meta progression here. The real issue atm is the speed you aquire the resources. It's slow. Unlike the two previous aspects of the meta progression system, i'm nowhere near done, i don't have all the nodes unlocked, most are at level 1 or 2. It's insanely grindy and i feel needs to be toned down.

Run progression:

Theres 6 aspect to this. The stat potions, the curses, the trinkets, the grid, the rhapsody and the elemental records.

Stat potions are the least interesting but still have an impact on your run of course. They are basically random stat increase and sometime decrease that can help you define a little bit more your character. That's it. Boring but i don't really mind it existing of course.

Curses usually have a temporary negative effect and a big stat upgrade to one aspect of your character. There's not many buffs and debuffs, and ultimately it's kind of boring too. I'd like to see this aspect of the game a little bit more improved with wilder debuffs and buffs cause it feels pretty samey honestly.

Trinkets are just here to refine your character. Get the elemntal ones if you focus on some elements, maybe the starting gold one to get a nice headstart, and choose one more after each chapter clear. Again it's ok, since you know what your options are i feel it's a bit more interesting that the two previous points but i see them more as a way to refine the character.

The grid. Ok so the grid is a weird one. I'd say most of it is boring stat change and will kinda randomly add power to your character but damn some of the nodes are wild. Special mention to the +30% damage per successive smash which is absolutely run defining. Just a single node can completely change how you will end up playing the game. And there's a few like this. Overall i do like the system and i'd like to see more of this kind of nodes rather than the more basic stat change ones. These rare nodes are single handhedly making this system incredible. Be more wild if you expand it with new effects.

Rhapsody is the best thing but i think it's very character dependant. Some of them completely change how the character plays, some of them just add more power of slightly change some attacks. Lilya I think has an awesome mix of skill that will impact almost all possible aspect of the character. Different auto attacks, different variation skill, different main skill, a smash upgrade, the ability to spam your main skill if you play on tempo. Genuinly incredible. Evelyn is also pretty decent but i think not as impressive as Lilya. Maz i feel is kinda boring, maybe i didn't play enough with him but i don't find that the change to his main skills are particularly interesting, and i don't see anything that alter how the variation skill works unlike the two other characters (it's not as wild for Evelyn either but it's still there). So yeah, best part of the game but some character currently have more interesting options i feel. Definitly what i want to see more of in the future, i'd love for the current and new characters to have more of these for sure.

Elemental records are kind of a mixed bag but tbh i think they do the trick just fine. I kinda don't pay attention to them cause it's mostly passive triggers that either work on normals, variation, smash or main. SOmetime there's a bit more of a strategy cause your main skill could be doing more damage if the enemies are frozen, or you can crouch to plant some turrets, but usually i feel it's simply better to just focus on a few main aspect (like variation skills on Evelyn and Maz) and thing will happen on their own without too much brain power. It's ok, i do hope that the effect become wilder and require a bit more thoughts with future additions however. It's the second best aspect i feel but Rhapsody is far more run defining imo.

So overall my opinion is that the meta progression is fine but needs some heavy fine tuning in speed for the evolution tree. And i'd like to see more of a focus on elemental records, the grid and especially rhapsody during the course of the EA. Also i'd argue that adding more to the rhythm element of the combat could be fun. The Lilya main skill reset on tempo press is so damn satisfying for example, we could use more of this kind of stuff. Maybe having normals or variation upgrades that work with the tempo.

[b]Biome Diversity:[/b]

A much shorter topic but also where i feel the game is currently lacking the most.
It need more gimmicks than the gacha, curses and the battle arenas as random events during combat sections.

The amount of different enemies per biome is just ok but i feel 2-3 more biome specific ones could really go a long way.
Do not understimate the joy of fighting 2-3 different bosses at the end of a biome, or more elites in the middle of a biome either. Constantly killing the same boss every runs gets old, at least personally. This is a strength of the genre i feel many roguelite end up dropping the ball with, and it would sadden me to see it being the case here once more. SInce they are story related, i'd say adding alternatives would be more fitting for difficulty level options after a cleared run, but it would still be a nice addition imo.

As for the room variety i feel it's also a bit lacking. Yeah i can believe there's 400 rooms but it still manages to feel a bit repetitive. There's also not enough of the mini game rooms. Like i feel all of them have 2-3 variations at best. I do really like them so i think adding more room like these would be cool to break the monotony, and more types as well.
Also a weird point but i feel that some of the traps you see in these rooms could be made part of a few basic combat arenas, to diversify each biome from one another. It would also justify the trap damage curse more as an actual threat than it currently is. I feel they are wasted in only being used in these rooms for now.

So yeah overall this aspect of the game is kinda meh but serviceable for now. Needs a bit of some polish across all aspects. It's not bad, especially for an EA start, but i hope it gets looked up a bit. As words of encouragement... It's still infinitely better than what game like Skul or even Hades started and even sometimes ended up with. So yes i'm very critical with this aspect, and i'd love to see you come out on top, as i feel the game as a lot of potential.",1.0

432,137204820,1669980,"This game is a lot of fun. Be a good dad and raise an awesome daughter. 

The game is similar to Long Live The Queen or My Life As A Teenage Exocolonist. 

You talk to people, give gifts, take classes, go on expeditions, farm, cook, work at a part time job, do alchemy, etc. You raise statistics through coursework, consuming certain farming outputs, consuming potions, buying outfits, or getting decorations for your house. Some combat specific stats can be raised through going on expeditions. Talking to characters you see on screen also grants a ""perception"" statistic / currency that is used when responding to letters you see if you have admirers, which can be gained from fame you get from attending balls or working as an actress, or from part time jobes at the bath with more sketchy jobs like card dealer for the mafia granting more admirers. The perception currency you get from talking to each character makes it worth while to talk to everyone and makes it so there are no useless character interactions in the game.

At the end of a playthrough, the person your daughter has the closest relationship with is the trigger for who your daughter marries as an adult. Your daughter may romance female characters if you to. Relationships with characters can be raised by chatting with them, giving them gifts, consulting them which also raises your statistics, challenging them to debates or duels, and taking them on dates. Dates so far seem completely platonic with some romantic undertones as nothing more lewd than handholding or hugging is shown (at least that I have seen in my 2 playthroughs so far).

As you play the game you will inevitably have accomplishments which are worth points at game end to make life the next time around easier. You can boost statistics, base relationship values with folks, boost fame, and get items for the next playthrough.

Like some other games in the genre, some of the ""best"" or possibly ""true"" endings are much easier to accomplish in your second playthrough with boosted statistics. There is some explanation on why the starting a new life narratively makes sense, but giving the specifics of why new game + is a thing in this setting would spoil the story. 

Current state, there are some typos, not enough to break the game, as the developer does not speak English natively. There are some bugs, that I ran into which caused me to need to restart the game. The developer has a discord and is actively working on fixing the reported bugs. 

I felt pretty good playing this game, I did not feel stressed out like I did in trying to get a good ending in Long Live the Queen. There are many endings you can get, and it is not the end of the world to get an average ending. Every playthrough can help you get achievements to boost your character in new game +. 

Oh, and the art is nice for the game. The seasonal changes in every single area of the game are nice.

This game isn't bad at all.
I think the part about using the cooperation between the Robot and the Kid to finish the act is interesting.
Also, I like the design of the Robot.

But there are still a lot of bugs that should be fixed, 

1. If the Robot or the Kid ran out of the map, I can do nothing but restart the act.
2. I don't know what's the difference between the screw and the gear in the map? All these two items offer 1 screw.
3. Only 1 BGM in the whole game.
4. Act 3 and Act 4 are not available, even though I've finished Act 2.
5. The distance of each floating platform is far af.

I returned to the original a few weeks ago, completely oblivious to the impending release of Rewind. Got much deeper into it this time, but that was more a matter of relying on guides than my own skill improving.

I mention all of this because it's more relevant to Rewind than you might imagine. In case you haven't learned this already, this is *not* a sequel. It's a soft remake, with easily the largest change being the new visual style. The rest of the changes are small enough that you can still use almost all of the same guides from the original to improve at this one.

That might sound disparaging, as if I'm suggesting that the changes are insignificant. But that's not quite right. The changes are small, yes. But in a game this complex, with this many intersecting components, small things can cast long shadows.

I'll admit I've somewhat lost my train of thought here. The end point I'm trying to make is that Rewind is a significant improvement over the original. I recommend it highly as a result.",1.0

447,137206903,1457080,"All in all as a person who 100%'d it on hardest... I'd give it two thumbs up. Solid story, Sylas isn't a 2D plank of wood personality wise so that's slick. The team that you a crew feels good. The game feels good. And you get a shitton of I frames on your dash and your Chain dash. The League Champ fights and boss fights were rough but fair, and rather Loyal to the original counterparts. Obviously some moves that are a bit of liberties, but all in all you see each and every ability.

Story: 8/10 Suprisingly felt decently paced but not perfect. A bit of highs and lows. And respect for sylas following through on his word and not being a full on dick as I thought he might be. Actual improvements on some character's lore or at least giving a better taste of them, and general solid progression of the demacian story.

Gameplay: 8/10 Enemies a decent bit varied, but lacking in actual total numbers when you actually look at how many are there. BUT! Each encounter is carefully crafted to not be obnoxious, unfair, or impossible so I'll take that trade off any day of the week instead of having the same enemy but color coded 6 different ways with the same attack but a different flavor. Most if not all casters are rather representative of their element and get bodied by the weakness element except for like... 2 three enemies off the top of my head? But that's primarily Nature Vs Wind being wonky as fuck and both having weird identities and executions for those two. But that's primarily through the spells you steal. Their enemies are rather solid, and none are too obnoxious. And those that are, are designed to have their face caved in easily or even pulled to you to cave their face in. You'll love your chain button by the end of the game mark my words. Though midgame felt a bit rough with how the progression system worked, still learning, and a bit of a pain in the ass that they introduce the ability to replay missions halfway through the game. POST one of the bosses that felt like the biggest wall I've come across. Though I was on the hard difficulty so take that with a grain of salt if you don't want that. Kinda wish they did more with the thing that let you pick up spells for random buffs assigned to random spells so you had to kinda plan a bit on what you took. Though better to want more than to be sick of the mechanic.

Collectibles: 10/10 They aren't ass, the letters/notes are rather nice touches to in world though primarily views of the citizens. Though a healthy few are fun nods to champions. Like how my favorite has a nod to Morg's baker skin where there's just a deadass real recipe for cookies near her hideout. And the silverwing chicks are decently cute as hell, and decorate your base once you get them. Also not obnoxious to find as if you keep an eye out you'll spot them and eventually be able to spot where they are. Though you will definitely have to do some Hall Wuggin' to get them all.

Sound: 9/10 Fuckin' mint. Plenty of VO and Sounds straight from League, but none of it felt out of place, and all characters felt pretty spot on. Music was exceptional, and not a tune felt out of place. Though the only thing not making it perfect is get ready to hear a lot of chain sound effects. Though admitedly, you should see that coming.

Bugs: 7/10 There were a healthy few that were later on in the game that weren't the worst though as of playing 1.0, the Fight with J4 and Shyv's 2nd Phase bugged out and their health bar showed empty for a while up until I just wailed on them to shift phase. The rest were primarily small visual bugs, and none that were absolutely negative.

Visuals: 9/10 Loved 'em. Everything was rather decently crisp. The design team did well by having a few colored pixels be decently expressive, and when zoomed into the portraits, they were decently expressive and spot on. The colors were flashy but not overwhelming. The design to seperate Sylas's projectiles from the enemies' was spot on with the darker colors.

For fans of assymetrical games, this is a fun, and relatively simple one. You have a team of worms who try to devour a team of humans who are trying to start a train. They gather resources (fuel), find a train key, and blow up train cars blocking the rail. The unique part of this is that worms are blind. It is only when a human moves on the ground that they can be seen by the worm. This leave sitting still for a while a viable strategy, as is getting to a ""safe"" point (worms can destroy houses eventually though, so sitting in one while the worm knows you there isn't necessarily the best).

A strong point is that the game is very accessible and easy to learn. My group, which didn't play the tutorial before hopping in blind, figured most things out within a couple of games. Of course, the trade off is that it may not be as ""deep"" as things like SCP Secret Laboratory, but it isn't trying to be that type of game. This should be thought of more as a casual game you can play with friends at the drop of a hat.

The other strong point, I feel, is that both sides feel genuinely fun to play. I've played many asymmetric games where the only ""fun"" roll is the small ""villain"" role and where the ""humans"" or ""good guys"" roles are only a disappointment that you put up with. I didn't find that to be the case here. Humans have to regularly make decisions based on the worm, and it never feels like you are ""out"" unless you die a second time. Even if caught by the worm you can escape via minigame, which avoids the common pitfall of assymetric games where you say ""yeah the villain's going to get me so what's the point of trying?""

Some additional details:

Humans do have some means to fight back against the worm in terms of:
1) Dynamite, which will make the worm receive a lot of damage
2) Escaping its clutches through a difficult timing minigame, which will very slightly damage it.

Damage only serves as a way of delaying a worm though. The ""slight"" damage forces them to find a pink orb underground before they can resurface, while if they take dynamite damage, they need to get several before they can surface.

When you have a group of new players, a single worm will be heavily favored even against 6 or 7, but as players get more experience, the optimal human to worm ratio will decrease. I recommend for a group of friends just starting to begin with only a single worm, and when the humans start winning safely, add more worms.

It is worth noting that 8 friends can play with a single purchase via the ""demo"" which is actually just for joining your friends for free. This is a great option to try things out with your gaming group and see how you like it.",1.0

Developed by Dragonis Games, Eresys is 4-person Lovecraftian Co-Op game on Steam. 

""With its mysterious and cursed forest, horrifying entities, missions, and mind-bending puzzles, Eresys promises to deliver an immersive and thrilling experience for players who dare to venture into the Lovecraftian Universe.""

In reality, it's an unplayable mess that is barely proof of concept and a very far cry from Early Access (which is what it has been released as).

Graphically the game looks okay...  until you try to move, or look in any direction. At  which point you just get graphical anomalies screen tearing unusual artifacts making it impossible to play let alone enjoy.

To be sure it wasn't just poor optimization, I dropped the resolution and settings way down but the issue persists. 

There seems to be a consensus around the quality of this game, as the are very few online players.

During my time playing the game for a review, I was unable to find a game to join or, when I hosted one, unable to find players to join me.

This game is VERY far from finished in it's current state, this is an alpha play test.

In my opinion, this should be a free sign up and not on any store front yet. 

At the moment it'sbin the very early stages of play testing and bug reports.

This this game is not ready for the marketplace yet and it's certainly far from even Early Access.

 I really do not agree with the practice of charging players to bug test alpha test nacent software.

The concept of the game is quite interesting, however, I fear it will never see success as any potential player base will be put off by its current state, never to return.

492,137209630,1967630,This game is just a map with creatures and resources spawning everywhere. Its like Icarus (and I hate Icarus) but worse because the UI is clunky and immersion breaking.

[b] If you have NOT played the first game, then it is highly recommended you do so because of all the references and returning characters, along with a spoiler regarding the first game's ending[/b]

[b] New things/differences from the first game(skip this part if not interested) [/b]

[list]
    [*] Nothing carries over from the first game, and you have to unlock the recipes again. they do reference the first game a bit.
    [*] 2 new drink bases: Blue Pea and Hibiscus. a few more new recipes. for those who are planning on going into Endless mode and unlock them, there are I believe 3 that are locked behind the story, as in even if you have the right mixture it will not give you the drink until you have to make them. most if not all the old recipes are the same, but you will have to unlock them again.
    [*]Characters: there are three New main characters, Riona the banshee, Lucas the Satyr, and [spoiler] Amanada the Alien, ""sister"" to Neil. [/spoiler] there are a few other minor characters, but aside from a scene or two, aren't as big.
    [*]Returning characters: Everyone makes a reappearance to some degree. Jorgi has been expanded upon and is more than being ""just there."" Myrtle and Aqua could be considered minor characters given how they have their own storyline but it's a lot smaller comparatively. Freya only makes a single appearance near the end.
    [*] a pretty underutilized item giving mechanic, where when you give the drink you can offer an item to the patron. you can't give the wrong thing to the wrong person, but you if you forget to give someone something it can affect your hidden score and therefore endings. there isn't a whole lot of items, but some of the things may or may not be self explanatory on who you're supposed to give it to(e.g. you might have to give something to someone, but you give it to someone else related to them).
    [*]small changes that I don't feel like they need their own bullet point but should be mentioned: in Endless mode, you can now pick who to serve based on who you met now instead of just Freya. Achievements are somewhat spoiler-ly in that they outright tell you what to do to unlock them, such as serving specific drinks to unlock new songs. not sure if the previous game had these kinds of achievements, but there are a few which involve doing things like doing bad enough to make someone not come back to even getting the worst endings possible(good luck with that).
[/list]

[b] The Actual Review [/b]

The first game has a lot of charm to it. I recently played it again just to see what it was like in anticipation for the sequel.
If you are asking if this game delivers, I would say yes and no. the game is a lot like the first one, built upon it, like a 1.5, which is probably why it is titled Episode 2 instead of a straight up sequel. The story takes place about 3 years after the first one, and you end up catching up with everyone and seeing how things have changed. If you like the first game for the atmosphere and characters, then this game will definitely be something you'll enjoy. If you're looking for expansion on the game-play however, you'll probably be disappointed, as the game does very little to change it up. given it's a ""don't fix what's not broke"" approach, it makes sense, but still a fair warning. the good of the game is a lot of what the first game had, but it also is the downside of it as you're getting more of the same, just slightly expanded upon.

Story wise, it felt either too fast, or too slow at times. some moments will go by quickly, and you'll be wondering what happened, while other times it feels like they're dragging on a bit, exploring the world but given how you don't have as much direct input, it doesn't feel quite as impactful(stop forgetting your lighter Jorgi). Freya isn't around this time, so when the days are over, you'll be talking to yourself, and most of the time won't really have a moment to reflect on everything that happened. Still, you do get your happy endings, but some of the story weren't explored as much, such as with Aqua and Myrtle, so it isn't as impactful.

gameplay wise, it's the same, just with 2 new ingredients and an item giving mechanic that really is underutilized in my opinion. it does affect what endings you get, but honestly the items you get are a small selection and it's fairly easy to figure out the right item to give, and moreso of knowing who to give it to(hint: you sometimes give an item not to the person directly, but someone related to them). aside from the small changes, they aren't really as big to where the gameplay evolved, but given the kind of game it is, it's not as big of an issue. as for the length, it took me roughly less than 7 hours to beat(beaten within 2 days) not counting the reloading I had to do, so it is a short game if you know what to do or look up a guide.

I'm a fan of the this series, so I am slightly biased when i say I give this game a 8/10, given how long I've been wanting to play this. However, if your'e someone new, and only recently played the first one, this will probably be more of a 6 or 7/10.",1.0

Some things to note:
- There isn't a breakdown of why stability is low. I would prefer if there is a menu where it says something like: ""this city has low stability because such and such.""
- Political power does nothing at the moment
- You don't get a breakdown of how much resources are being produced. If I build a bakery or a farm, I want to know how much wheat is being produced per day or week.
- Diplomacy is too simple at the moment. There is no option to join an a war an ally is in. You also can't call in an ally to your war.
- This is a personal preference, but there isn't a good way to optimize production of resources. You can select the option to send resources weekly to a city, but you'd have to do it for every single city. Maybe an option where it just sorts resources by itself would be better.

In conclusion, this game can definitely become one of my favorites, but it isn't there yet. Maybe when it gets out of early access. I just hope it doesn't get abandoned like Freeman.",0.0

Highly Recommend if you like good NSFW CG and horror thriller gameplay.  Game's pretty good at trying to nerve wrack the players.  While the attempts are to mess with the player, the games also pretty lenient so you CAN BREATHE because you engage RPG combat and fight your way out of the enemy since there are many games that don't even let you fight back.

546,137211903,1698220,"A great successor to a game that I enjoyed playing a while ago. The new movement abilities were fun to play with and works fairly well with other mechanics, mainly the magnetic stuff. The map seems to be larger too, adding more things to do overall in gameplay.

The puzzle part of the platforming is still decent but seems to be less of a focus then the original or is at least easier in that aspect. The focus seems to be more on the platforming side of puzzle platformers, since the new upgrades and changes focus on it more. Only other complaint of something specific would be that the boss before you get your last upgrade was too simple and could easily be beaten in less than 10 seconds, making it pointless to even have gameplay wise.

554,137211919,2321210,"This game is great but there a lot of QOL issues that break immersion, here are my issues.....

#1 Identity

This game is advertised as a rouge-like but it also has the most half-4ssed rhythm aspect that I have ever seen. Basically every 4 beats if you hit on-beat your 2nd attack does a little more damage... and that's the entire rhythm aspect of the game and because of this the game has awful repetitive music to keep you on beat. As a result of this there is also an beat indicator that is very hard to see and makes it hard to play and look at the same time and because every beat sounds the same you have to look at it, it really ruins the experience.

-I feel like they should completely remove this feature add better music and just add a cool-down instead

#2 English dub 

its clearly an AI which is not bad but its done horribly, Its almost like they fed a Language model every anime girl dub to ever exist and then tossed a Chinese and a Australian person in there for good measure and it ruined everything. (it sounds like a Chinese person speaking Engrish-Australian sometimes)

#3 Grammar

I have no clue what I am reading sometimes

#4 video settings

-No anti-aliasing

-If you set the game to windowed mode you cant move the window around and its stuck in 
the center of your monitor 
(whats the point then????) 

-Display mode does not work properly, border-less and windowed get each other mixed up 
sometimes.

-No proper window scaling it is a fixed 16:9 

-Graphics quality appears to do absolutely nothing





Conclusion: I will come back when it is more polished :)",1.0
555,137211771,1669980,"Overall, I really enjoy this game. If you liked My Life as a Teenage Exocolonist or Long Live the Queen you'll probably have a good time with this. It has a lot of content, I'd say I like it more that Long Live the Queen. Not nearly as much as My Life as a Teenage Exocolonist for a few reasons. There are several problems that you may or may not be able to overlook.

Most noticeably, the translations are CRUNCHY. It's not really a problem for most of the game, you can pretty easily get the gist of what was meant. Once you get in to later story stuff for the true ending it gets pretty difficult to understand, to the point that I'm wondering if there are some sequence breaks I found accidentally.

There are also two pretty severe and consistent game breaking bugs. First and foremost are the gift letters you receive. These will lock the game up every single time you try to open one. Fortunately they aren't really a necessary part of the game, they're mostly for flavor. Second is a save data corruption bug that can happen if you have cloud saves enabled. As of the version I'm playing (1.00.00 I think) the devs even have it in the announcements with instructions for how to turn off cloud saves. There are also a number of other bugs that are less consistent, e.g. I once had to force quit when I got stuck in the horse capturing event.

There is still a lot to be desired, but just with the bare bones this game has to offer it's already worth putting some hours in to it. It's a challenging game but not over punishing. The mechanics are simple are enough, but enjoyable and have enough depth. I would love to see some quality of life added to logistics, and inventory urgently.

But overall, I happy with the systems they have implemented and excited to see what they add, they are really creating a solid foundation.

I would recommend buying since it's already fun to play, and do get your $30 worth already, and I would love to see what this project could do with more funding.

Terrible font choice. Bad translation. Really hard to read.

First play through, got to day 4, not sure why the police alert kept going higher.

Got to court, hit ""Start"" without using the slot machine, lose. Okay.

Second play through. Pretty much game over on day 1. All of my guys failed their missions. Couldn't proceed. Restart.

Get hit by random event cards. Cant find the ""Discard random event"" card. 
Game punishes you for... playing the game. So if you get a bad event card and its going to get filled, just stop playing cards and let the day end. Seems like bad design where the best move is to stop playing.

Also they absolutely ruined the game by tying the puzzle challenges to progression. The old version where you could just progress by doing dungeons was much better. The new kingdom stuff is terrible.

573,137214343,2089500,"Honest Reviews

Pros
1) The 2d visual & soundtracks are great.
2) Figuring out what the right card to use on each event/fight is fun (the first time around). 
    For example, Giving away a herb or an upside-down herb will result in a different out come.
    Using water card to interupt enemy fire spell. Using fire card on the Fool when he is drinking to set him on fire.
3) Eventhough it has no major effect on the gameplay I like how each children has their own unique characteristic & 
     interactions.
4) Base Upgrade Feature (in which doesn't last very long...)
    
Cons
Despite having some fun mechanics such as parry & elemental counterplay, the core gameplay end up being just spamming attack & heal cards ez win. I actually don't mind a game being too easy but the lack of new enemy variety & event make later runs kinda dull. For example, the Whale, Oarfish & Jellyfish all share the same attack pattern despite looking completly different.",1.0

Stop leaving false information on reviews about the game being Pay To Win. Currently there is no Pay to Win mechanic in the game. Buying any of the packs grants you the same gameplay experience. Buying the Ultimate pack will only grant you 2-3 additional racers which you can also buy shards for from the shop when they become available. None of the come fully upgraded or something, everything level 1. 

The additional currency received from the pack? Sure is good to burn it all on the lootboxes like an idiot to get that extra shard you need. But you can also wait for the shards to become available in shops. The additional tokens for the boxes? Is it really pay to win if you open 3 extra boxes? 

Stop with the pay to win crap because this is not the case, the game does not require you any additional payments after you bough the game, you can't buy currency with real money, you just grind it like a normal person. But you open lootboxes for that extra shard because you want to upgrade NOW instead of waiting for an event that gives shards or to become available in the shop. 

Maybe you think there are few racers now, but the roster grows with every season (same with the tracks) The sense of speed is not enough? Come into a multiplayer race with me, I'll bash and stun you so fast, you will pray to the devs to make the game slower xD.

The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare released in 2019 was a huge success, not only is it still regarded by many as the best Call of Duty game in recent years, but it also attracted many game developers to create similar games in order to replicate its success. Combat Master is such a mobile game that has been ported over, With almost the same UI and gameplay as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019), it has been able to gain a lot of praise from players. In addition to its own uniqueness, the phenomenon behind it is really worth reflecting on.

The stiff and strange movements, the simplistic game interface, the endless bugs and optimization issues, the rough game modeling, the mediocre sound effects of gunfire, and the numerous Bots in the game all make Combat Master a game that is only passable on mobile platforms, but difficult to reach a passing grade on PC. This is also why many players question why this game still has positive reviews.

Understanding the failures of the Call of Duty series in recent years is the key to understanding the success of Combat Master. Since the 2019 release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, player reviews for its sequels, Call of Duty: Black Ops - Cold War and Call of Duty: Vanguard, have gradually declined. The poor performance of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II in 2022 has pushed player dissatisfaction to its peak, as the reduction in mobility and the tactical realism in essence violated what most players crave in Call Of Duty. Combat Master simply relies on its highly flexible mobility similar to that of Titanfall and its exciting gameplay experience, which is enough to win players' hearts.

Of course, there are still many issues with Combat Master today, whether it's the lack of human players in matches or the unfair competition caused by PC players being matched with mobile players. This is somewhat similar to the situation where Ravenfield began to be favored by players after Battlefield 2042 failed, and I personally think this is a sociological problem. As a free game,  many Call of Duty players who have never tried the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) can find the long-lost happiness in this game - regardless of the level, they are often able to dominate the game. but how long this game can survive is a huge question - whether it's considering future legal disputes or the game's user base.",1.0

It's similar to Mount & Blade, but in a modern setting. It can be seen that the game is a bit damp, because, according to my feelings, it can be filled with much more content than is available at the moment. Also, I got a few bugs during the game, and I hope that the developers will fix the very ""sophisticated"" logistics, from which you get very tired in the middle stages of the game. But, judging by the posts of the developers, they have further plans for the game, and let's hope that it will develop further, and they will change the game to a more playable state.

Developers, if you read the reviews, it would be very interesting to learn more about the lore of this game so that it is organically reflected in the gameplay.",1.0

It is worth noting the excellent translation into Russian, which is very good for a free game. Also the beautiful pixel visuals of the game are most appealing. However, I would advise the developers to tweak the court work, as even with a 95% winnable case I can be arrested.

Gameplay:
https://youtu.be/boFRHsG-DZQ

The game’s art style is mesmerizing and charming. It resembles a wonderful fairy tale.

You take a team of cute kids and force them to explore deeper and deeper into different dungeons.
You’ll steadily progress to the bottom of the tower, fighting mobs, leveling up, getting new cards/abilities, and encountering random events with a series of choices.

Arcana of Paradise significantly differs from others in the genre.
It's narrative-focused and adds card turning upside down mechanics, attack timer system and deal a new hand.

This Rogue-Like Card Game is unique and engaging. It's great fun experience full of content to keep you hooked for a very long time.

Repetitive.
Doesn't care about english speaking clients (Updates or patches being chinese only).
Too much dialogues, you wanna be visual novel or rogue-like?
False claim about game being long, it's just very sluggish grind on the same levels. (400 battlefields apperently but i've seen like 15-20 repeating over and over again).
I have no opinion about voice acting and story since i skip it, reason being that i can't stand anime type of voice and have no intrest in story at all. (It's personal nit-pick i know but i prefere silent creepy traders etc.)
The whole Intimacy system could be removed and instead make another playable character or something...

It's not a typical rogue-like where you can chill and watch yourself grow... It's very basic with upgrades that have little to no impact. You are required to spend some time and learn every enemy and your move, NOT the items that makes rogue-like fun. I've completed all 3 stages.

648,137220121,1928870,"I have to say, this game is being negatively reviewed for little to no reason. This is an incredibly fun and charming action strategy game with only minor issues that prevent it from being a great game. I think this is a very good game regardless of any flaws, and a lot of fun overall.

Let me start by saying this, I played through the campaign in co-op, and had such a blast. The world is sprawling, beautiful and has plenty of things to do. On top of that, the map has some element of procedural generation, meaning no two maps will be exactly the same. The beauty of the large open world and the sprawling epic battles with hundreds of units feel absolutely awesome. The sound design is also particularly good, making you feel evermore present in this epic world. We finished it in 15 hours at our own leisure, something we found out that less than 15% of players have done at the time of reviewing this. I just find it baffling that so many people decided to

When you play this game, you will realize that this game doesn't excel past it's peers in either the action or strategy formats. I think this is the wrong lens to view this game through. It's the way that this game combines elements of both genres that feels great. This type of gameplay might have a niche audience, but for that niche, I think it's going to be absolutely awesome. 

In terms of strategy, this game offers a limited number of buildings and units to the player, however, what it does well, is it makes everything in the sandbox useful. Every unit has it's place and time to be used effectively. Every building is the same. 

When exploring the map, each point of interest is going to be an important factor in slowly stopping the Piglin hordes. You can find special golem units, special towers and extra resources for some crucial upgrades you will need to use back at homebase, the Well of Fate. There are a wealth of resources, and you will need these to slowly expand your arsenal as the piglins get evermore destructive. Some of the epic sieges took an hour to complete. 

Another thing you will notice about this game that I think differentiates it a little, is how much this game emphasises temporary structures. The game is about slowly expanding your battle lines and in the process you will lose plenty of buildings, all while slowly gaining ground. It's quite fast paced. In co-op, this works great as the game offers so many ways for players to work together, even while being on the opposite sides of the world. 

As for negatives, I didn't like the limited number of structures that could be built at the well of fates. While I understand the need to limit the number of units in the game, everything else should have been relatively unlimited in my opinion. On the flipside, with the structures offered, the current gameplay for the campaign felt well balanced. 

Another negative is the potentially stupid AI. Countless times the units miss the bridges you built and fall off. This wasn't too big of an issue, but a minor nuisance nonetheless. 

There were also minor bugs and some minor issues with the controls which can be a bit finicky at times. 

I think the biggest error for this game was the marketing. Frankly, most people had no idea what this game was even after the first 2-3 trailers. I had the benefit of listening to reviews before purchasing this product. I knew exactly what I was getting, and got exactly what the reviewers I listen to said I would get. I feel like the same can't be said for some others. I think people should take the negative reviews with a grain of salt and go and watch actual reviews for the game on Youtube before deciding if this game could be for them. 

Aside from this, had a really positive experience. Look forward to upping the difficulty before another run through the campaign.",1.0

Trying to fight a group of gun toting AIs whose accuracy on their weapons is WAY better than yours, spawn in groups of 1-4, attack you at a range further than you can see (unless you have a sniper, stand still, and aim with right click), AND who have a chance to drop nothing useful, is just ass design.

Can't read letters as there's no way to switch from the first letter in the stack or close the top window when you open them. Meaning you have to force quit the game. That's an entire feature of the game that not only doesn't work but literally breaks the game. Its also essentially auto save only. There is a save function, but when you load the game no matter where you saved you restart the entire day so you really can only save at the start of the day, where auto save saves your game already. To be fair the game tells you this when you save but if that was going to be the case the devs could have totally take the player save functionality out had the same result and fixed other bugs. If the player save feature is going to be there it should do something. Not sure if others had the issue, and at least this bug wasn't game breaking, but there is a stables race game bit to the game and it just doesn't function. You hover over the button to ""Participate"" and you can sit there and click all day but despite the button reacting visually to you hovering over and clicking it the button does nothing. Sometimes other clicks don't respond but if you wait a second and click again it suddenly works, and other times you click to read dialogue and it just skips two or three frames of dialogue or narrative and there's no way to go back so you just flat out miss it.
I feel like this could be a very good game especially for $10, but with all the bugs and some of them flat out game breaking along with sections/features of the game that just don't work at all this feels like a beta version or an early access game that you're paying for to do beta testing for free for the devs. Maybe there will be an update that fixes everything and I'll have to change this review, but until then I just can't recommend the game.",0.0

Opening 
================================================================================================
My daughter was born on 23 April and named Jean. I must admit, this is truly a difficult start since early departure of my wife, but I must press on for the sake of our daughter, our dream. At her early age, we loved to went around town and tried everything we could do at that day. early morning activity was always go-to start for our plan. I knew, this wouldn’t lead to any further mastery in her future, nevertheless I wished she enjoyed everything that I could offer. 
As she growed up, she started to went around town and be a part of them. She truly one of the heart from the town, everyone is her friend. -heck, even i lost count, how many people has come to our house to see her (my guess is roughly 9, for romantic event). But it put ease on my mind since I got caught an unknown disease. At least, if it’s the will from the heaven to separate us on earth prematurely, she still had the town to rely on. But thanks to the heaven for he decided not to do so until the time.
My daughter wasn’t a champion but she was champion in my heart. She might not the best daughter in the world, but she’s the best for me and I hope the best for her. I’m proud of her, because she can be who she is and married to whom she loves.
Welp, actually, that’s my bad. I thought, it was better to had good term with his headmaster- Mr. Claude- so she wouldn’t have much trouble in school. Both of them took it too seriously, what a mess. At least, my advice, to cook first the ingredients, which come from her adventure, was a good idea. She becomes a good cooker and has her own restaurant.
And here I’m, on the first spring of this year without her, my wife reach home, which is truly a saving grace.
Also my transformation into a chicken is canceled, I don’t know why. I’m disappointed.

Review
================================================================================================
(Disclaimer) This’s my first steam review. It’s worth to take note that my gaming history mostly in fps genre and/or something relate to world war 2 but recently, I want to expend my horizon. So, take my opinion with a grain of salt. No, a lot of them, not just a grain.
Volcano Princess is a rising-“daughter” simulation with visual novel and rpg frame. The players are tasked to raise her daughter whatever they see suit for her. Your aim is her future career and fiancé (and yes, you can make your daughter marry to other daughter, I tried this to avoid “cucked” feeling but failing due to academic reason: pleasing the headmaster). How to do it? Raise those numbers, baby~. Each turn, the player has a number of action. It can be used to do activity and replenished in certain ways. To end turn, player “plan” study activity for the daughter.
There’s a lot of arts, ton of them, and there’re good but due to the variety accessories, I find it’s insufficient and bothering. But this flaw is ignorable.
The voice is limited to just reaction such as laughing, thinking, etc. There’s no text reading.
The music is okay at bringing the mood, but I ignored it most of the time.
The rising elements (or the gameplay) is okay. Most of the time, the players raise her daughter through town interaction and planning system. I find this system is boring, due to repetitiveness, since most daughter actions are dictated by player options directly (not through father as mediator) and counted in numbers. I prefer to say it as lack of surprise element because it’s sureness (the authority of player and the honesty of numbers). % RNG isn’t the surprise element I mean, but the turning events base on choice like “Disco Elysium” (unfair comparison, but that’s the best I have). 
The story is niche, classic fantasy and a little bit of plot. I’m not sure how the plot turns out since somehow, I managed to avoid by achieve true ending. The good part is the light-warm interaction between char’s family. Other interactions are sometimes ambiguous due to translation, but still readable by putting few logics. Too bad, I couldn’t focus the story much (mostly I skimmed) because I feel uncomfortable with the UI. It’s my problem since I have encounter many similar UI and I couldn’t do much about my concentration.
The game itself is a little bit buggy. I couldn’t open the letter from friends (or I stuck with letter in opened position) and few times my games force close by itself, I’m not sure why.
Final verdict, I with reluctant to pick unrecommended but due to major recommended review, I decide so. I couldn’t recommend this game to past-self because my gaming history. Nevertheless, it still a good experience although at certain point, I want to bash my head to my keyboard so badly. I highly recommend this game to people that love raising-simulation, romance, and/or “visual novel”. If you’re a casual, I recommend you to wait for a while because the bug problem and translation issue.

706,137223422,1899350,"Could be a fun little trading game but right now it's got a lot of little annoyances which add up and make me not enjoy spending all that much time in it. 

Right off the start, the most basic thing such as zoom & pan isn't available and you have to unlock it. Fair I suppose, it's a game, it's gotta have challenges. So you unlock the brush which allows you to do that but now after every step/new candle it resets your view, and honestly the controls for it are really not that great. Just make them the same as they are in Trading View. Also after every step the slider on the left which determines your position size gets reset for no reason. There's also no way to change the time frame which is such a basic essential thing. There's no way to set position size based on a % and no way to set a stop loss or a take profit. No way to customize the chart and change candle/background colors. People trade in all kinds of different ways but it seems like the game is only catering to a specific type of trader. It's possible that some of these get resolved further down the line, I just couldn't be bothered to get that far. 

I'd be happy to change this to a positive review if some of these get resolved because I do think the game has lots of potential especially considering the lack of competition but right now it feels really bare bones and frustrating.

I'm gonna be getting into some spoilers so keep that in mind.

When I fight Sylas' nightmare it is extremely easy to accidentally dash off the edge, get teleported back to your spot and then get hit anyway. Likewise when you fight Garen again you sometimes just get hit from behind because of the hitbox. 

Another giant issue with this game is the lack of a skip option for cutscenes, you can speed up convos but that doesn't change the fact when characters act out animations. This is extremely obnoxious when you're stuck at a boss and you're forced to just sit through the same cutscene 10 times in a row.

713,137225093,2020710,"The game is OK, but it needs some serious balancing.  Everything is based on research, but it ends up being a big series of gates. For example, someone has a broken bone. They need a need ""a [Icon of medicine bottle] in a mattress"".  So, do you need to take a bottle of medicine and wrap it in a mattress? No.  If you go and look at the research tree, you see that down the list there is medical treatment that gives you a mattress.  Oh, OK. Let me make the mattress. 

However, before I can research the medical skill, I have to research making bars (places where you drink, not metal rods).  So I guess it makes sense. You make bars and then need medical services after a rough night at the bar. Let's get that out of the way. Oh, I need 8 cooked fish.  ??? To research bars I need 8 cooked fish. OK, so let me make 8 cooked fish.  OK, so waiting on the NPCs to do it takes forever.  Meanwhile I'm not sure if the person in pain is going to die or leave or what.  

Finally, finished with 8 cooked fish I got before anyone could eat them.  Research.  OK, good to go. Let's get medical.  Oh, I need to steel or iron nuggets? I have to build a scuba shed. Oh, I need to research that... 

People aren't happy.  Well, I researched churches so I'll make one of those.  Oh, I need 15 bricks. I can only make one at a time, I can only assign one person to one forge so if I make more forges I need more free people to assign them to. In other words, it's a very long process that requires no skill or planning. It just straight out takes a long time to make 15 bricks.  Maybe the NPCs should just pray for the bricks or something.

The game isn't bad, it just feels like I'm running around all the time trying to make X amount of something to get through the next gate so that I can do it again.  I feel like I'm always trying to play catch up rather than planning my base/town and enjoying it.

There also seems to be only so many areas you can build in. I see that there's things like flying, but I don't have that yet - not sure how I get it. There's a sick bird but it says there's no options to do anything so I guess at some point I'm going to have to do something that allows me to heal him, but no idea what.

A penguin showed up at my dock, but since I have no zoologist and no idea how to get one, he just left. No idea when, or if, he'll come back or why I'd care.  For the love of god, won't somebody think of the penguins?

The idea is good, the game looks good, runs fine, and doesn't crash so there's no problem there. I just think there needs to be a clearer picture of what you need to do rather than bumping into unknowns and then trying to figure out what you need to do and then create 12 pairs of used underwear to upgrade to the laundry skill which lets research the dancing skill after getting 7 rotten fish so you can research the bubbly tea skill with 6 moldy stones so you can make a drink to make some guy happy. (Not really, but you get the idea).

I think it can/will be good and there's a demo so you can check it out yourself. In this case I think early access means that they need to polish up the game play rather than add features and get the bugs out of the engine, so there's a good chance this game will shape up to be something good, but for right now the game play seems a little tedious, random, and pointless.",1.0

There are a number of glitches that can anywhere between slightly annoying and soft-locking the game and since it's a small team the bug-fixing might take a bit. Translation is also pretty iffy but at least for me it never got in the way of understanding the story, most of it is words being translated differently in different spots, especially names (ex: Volcano year vs fire year or Rebressa vs Lebesa)

727,137225860,1860510,"The gameplay is like a mix of Mount & Blade, Total War & ARMA.  Sounds like a dream game on paper. It kinda reminds me of that game ""Freemen: Guerilla Warfare"" except better in every way imaginable. The graphics are brilliant. I LOVE the ability to command battles via two different, interchangeable modes (First Person like Mount & Blade, or a birds eye, Tactical Mode like Total War). You can take control of individual units or command them all. As for the campaign, there is a full diplomacy system, the production/trading of goods & research trees. Aesthetically the world map looks and plays similar to Total War's campaign map, however everything's done in real time vs turn based. For your forces, Moving troops, replenishing units and properly equipping them all feels easily manageable. you can also customize the name of your battalions, as well as their appearance, weapons and equipment. 

There are some improvements I'm hoping we see throughout Early Access. When you choose a faction, there isn't any descriptions or stats; you're basically blindly picking one. Once you select a faction & load in, it then gives you a proper backstory of your selected faction; I just don't see why this wasn't added in the selection screen. The tutorial is just a Steam Guide, which leaves out a lot of important details. The game is still too new to find tips online, so without a proper tutorial (or a more detailed guide) you're often left a little lost. The game needs to give the player a little guidance at the start or else you'll sometimes ask yourself ""What am I supposed to be doing right now?""

 The campaign could benefit from a mission system. Right now it feels like nothing really has a narrative to it. Long term goals, short term goals, more randomized events and more AI vs AI activity in the world would help this. It says you can create your own faction in the description of the game but I haven't found the ability to do that yet. Unless I'm missing something, they should really take that out until that feature is implemented. 

Overall, as a passionate fan of games like Mount & Blade, Total War & ARMA; I am really enjoying Total Conflict.

Character balance is all of the place. (Mike from monsters inc is incredibly broken, almost all the same character every race)
The grind is insane for how the limit you in many while while making getting items for different characters as confusing as possible.
I would not recommend this game at all unless you really just have fun racing bots.
Oh, and the bots. If you are over leveled, they will rubber band past you the entire race. Then on the last lap they will basically just shut off their engines. It doesnt matter how fast you go, all that matters is your level based on the difficulty.

753,137226391,1967630,"holymoly it has been some time since i played a game with the amount of garbage and clunkyness this one here has.

The graphics are quite good so far, but thats it.

The gameplay and movement mechanics are complete garbage.
The way they put a ""simulation-layer"" behind every basic sort of action like ""grab a hanging coconut from a palm taking 40 minutes time + ~40% chance to injure yourself while doing it --> the wound you recieve as a result is not just a simple HP-drain but a status-ailment"" lets you limbo in micro-management loops way to often.

For example: - difficulty setting: Hard

Your Character starts with 100 points which slowly drain during a day.
Hunting a whole chicken --> harvesting its meat --> ignite a fire on your campfire --> cook the meat --> eat the meat (all of it with a small to mediocre chance to suffer a wound) takes around 2-3 hourse meanwhile where your hunger depletes by a far greater value then this could balance out.

Even without that you would need 11 chicken or 35 coconuts (whole! and not the ""green"" ones, as they only quench your thirst!) to eat to go through the day.

What happens when you get injured while crafting/cooking/harvesting or else?? --> you need to mitigate the effect with another loop of ""gather leafes to make a bandage (which could take you hours as the tend to appear extremely scarce) --> craft a firestarting tool, ignite a fire (which will fail quite often --> the amount of time (60 minutes!) is still spent!), craft a bandage --> apply the bandage...then notice that the bandage only heals 1-2 stacks of wound --> craft another bandage (takes 30 minutes and you need a burning fire to do so).

Meanwhile you beginn to become exhausted.
You will need to build a sleeping bag for which of course you need other materials.
The crafting takes 45 minutes, with a 14% chance to hurt yourself.
You cannot sleep, when you are hurt, hungry or thursty.
You cannot craft when you are sleepy.
You cannot make food, for which will need ""crafting"" when you are sleepy.

Everything in this game is so damn boring and pointless beyond the point of stupidity and lack of logic.

Why ffs. can't you take a damn stone and throw it up to a palm to gain a coconut?

I hope steam lets me refund this even with allmost 3 hours spent ingame.",0.0

757,137228037,1621990,"Great game for an early access game. Very few bugs, most were a pop up of a weapon stats that shows in the inventory, showing after a cutscene. but after opening the inventory it went away. Didn't always happen either.
31 hours of play and exploring and finally beating the story.

Gameplay: Souls like combat, God of War style world where you have to come back after getting skills to get to spots left unexplored. Different degrees of difficulty. Bosses were good and unforgiving at times.

Weapons: Each weapon in the game plays differently, and there are 30 weapons. Some are slow and heavy hitting, some are fast and agile. Each unlocks with finding a blueprint. some after leveling up. Mastering each weapon lets you learn 1-2 passive skills that make you stronger, more HP, etc.

Armor: is the same as weapons. lots of blueprints to find. There are the main armor, shoulder and helms. each with a different look and varying armor and energy effective levels.

World: the world has varying landscapes from green forest to snowy mountains to caves. the enemies in each area have a fun mechanic. when you clear out an area of Beasts for example, the next time you come back, it might have been settled by some soldiers that made camp there, with buildings and such. clear those soldiers and the next time the camp is kind of destroyed and beasts or other wildlife may have moved in again. so the same type of enemies are not always in the same places. Enemies do not automatically respawn when activating a life tree spawn point. they will after leaving the area far enough and coming back.

Overall a great game with lots of fun, 31 hours into it for $27? definitely worth it.",1.0
758,137226457,1621990,"Despite its enchanting setting and captivating storyline, Stray Blade does have a few technical issues that need to be addressed. 


While the game's art and level design are both impressive and beautiful, there are a few bugs and glitches that detract from the overall experience. 


The main issues revolve around the camera. The camera lock on seems to flick randomly between enemies you're currently attacking and others that are patrolling in the distance currently unaware of your presence. You can turn this option off in the settings, but even then frequent and random camera resets take you out of the action and make combat difficult; especially when fighting multiple enemies.


It basically becomes more luck than timed parries and dodges.


The game's dodge, parry, and roll mechanics are a bit sluggish and imprecise, which can make combat feel clunky, floaty and unsatisfying at times. Overall it just doesn't feel as responsive and polished as say a genuine soul's game.


There are some nice execution cinematics but there are also some pretty rubbish ones it can get a little repetitive as can the final narrative of the enemies. A seemingly Greta Thunberg inspired ""how dare you!""  seems to play over and over again as you dispatch humanoid enemies. 



Despite these issues, Stray Blade still manages to offer a very immersive gaming experience in the soulslike vein. 



Stray Blade has plenty of loot but not in the traditional sense of these types of games. As enemies are killed they will drop varying levels of materials needed for the games very comprehensive crafting system. 


The different variety of weaponry on offer give you plenty of opportunities to customize your character and create a truly unique gameplay experience. With three Acrean metals to master, you'll have plenty of challenges to keep you engaged and entertained.


Overall, Stray Blade has the potential to be a truly amazing ARPG. With its colorful fantasy setting, engaging storyline, and innovative crafting system, it's an easy recommend .

You have quite a nice map so far. Where there are different areas that you can take. Whether as a democrat, communist or as a rebel. Where the rebels have no city only a very large army.
You start to ""build"" your city and supply it with goods.
Research new weapons/vehicles and create your own units. Currently still a bit time consuming because you can not rename the troops and save. 
Then you start to conquer the lands and cities little by little.
It's a great game for those who like a hybrid of RTS/FPS. 
So far the only good game that offers the possibilities.

Hmph, only 17 minutes of playtime for Desktop Dungeons? As a transformer, I know that's plenty of time to form an opinion on this game. After all, I'm far smarter than any puny human.

Let's talk about the gameplay. The concept of randomly generated dungeons is intriguing, and I appreciate the turn-based strategy mechanics. The retro-style graphics may seem outdated to some, but I find them charming in a nostalgic way. The game's soundtrack could use a bit more variety, but it's still enjoyable.

Overall, I give Desktop Dungeons [b]7/10[/b]. It's a solid indie game that's worth checking out, especially for fans of classic dungeon crawlers. But let's be real, it's no Transformers: Devastation. That game was a masterpiece. [h1]DECEPTICONS FOREVER[/h1].",1.0
789,137226822,226620,"This game is hard. I'll say it again for the people in the back, THIS GAME IS *HARD*.

If you like games that have a hint button, or a little sparkle after 10 seconds to point you in the right direction...

This is NOT that game.

This is FUN but challenging and brutal roguelike/roguelite. This game will give you some cheeky text, some cryptic hints, and a very very quick tutorial. But it does NONE of these things while holding your hand and telling you it will be alright. You will gain things from and between dungeon runs that carry over and make the next run just a teeny (teeny tiny) bit more doable. 

For a game from 2011, it reminds me of some great Popcap games, like the original PvZ, while having much more complex depth and endless puzzles. People saying it's not really a dungeon crawler, it's just a puzzle game hiding... This is a true-blue roguelike, not some quirky spin on the genre. It's turn-based tactics and every dungeon is randomly spawned so you never know what you're going to get to aid you. Or murder you. Not every dungeon can be beat *with what you have right now in this run*, and that's the random nature of it. Not every spell or item spawns in every run. It would have greatly benefited from a combat log, it's absence is very strange for a roguelike, but alas, it doesn't have it, so sometimes you're left staring at an abruptly-ended run wondering how that monster just killed you when you thought you were perfectly healthy, and there's no good way to figure out why except to think real hard before clicking out. 

Actually one of the nicest gifts from the devs is that the monsters don't move around. Everyone would lose a lot more runs if these monsters chased you down, too.

For some perspective, I play a lot of roguelikes, I think I'm decent at puzzles. After 50 hours, I've only unlocked 8 out of 16 classes, 6 out of 7 races, and a fraction of the building upgrades. Every class and race has it's own mechanics, some are familiar and intuitive, others are tricky and it's only after a few runs and the right glyph (spell) on the board that you realize how *good* they are. Sometimes you find random rooms in a dungeon and these are definitely puzzles, and you may not figure it out this time. At least one of your attempts to figure it out might kill you. Puzzles inside puzzles.

There are lots of mechanics at play. There are lots of tricky, clever ways to combine tactics. Over a few losses you will learn them. Over many you might someday master them. Either way, you will die a lot. And it will feel really good when you win. If you really like roguelikes, original genre/style roguelikes, this is one of the best I've played.",1.0

794,137230627,1621990,"Stray Blade was definitely a game I looked forward to getting after seeing an early access review of it. However after playing  it for awhile I realized how hard this game really is. If your expecting a soul-like well it might play out more like Bloodborne, Ashen, or For Honor. (I chose the standard Adventurer Difficulty for this review)

First off with graphics and design. The landscape is quite beautiful, its got a magical fantasyland feel to it. It looks like playing an old PlayStation game like Jack and Daxter or Fable. As Far as I know The map has some backtracking for secrets and unlockable shortcuts, potentially unlockable fast travel later on. They give you some parkour to the level design allowing you to climb various cliffs and find hidden secrets just like how Ashen is. The lore is fairly decent too and has a logbook so you can pick up books or tablets and read them later if you want to focus on adventuring.

The ambient music is pretty decent but the battle theme is the same for about every fight and is a little over-the-top and overused I'd say. The Voice acting however is pretty good With likeable characters and comedic value. It doesn't skimp out on dialogue using voice lines only for cutscenes and then giving you word box to read the rest yourself like so many other games do. This game is fully voiced all the way. Your own character, Male or Female is fully voiced too so your not just another voiceless character with no personality. You sound like a seasoned adventurer who's just a little confused on where you are and whats your purpose in the story.

There's plenty of character customization, armor and a vast array of weapons as you can tell from the skill tree. You can change you pigment color on your armor and weapons as well and find colors in the world. the skill tree is mostly just passive buffs to your overall character and using various weapons offers new unlockable passives that you can use when you try out other weapons. That way your not forced to stick with one weapon type the whole game and incentivises you try new things without feeling your points are invested in just one weapon type. The gear you get is entirely crafted from materials you find and using blueprints dropped from enemies or chests. Unfortunatly no pre-crafted gear for you to just pick up and use on the go. The major flaw I feel with this system is crafting stations are placed thick in enemy camps and you have to fight a bunch of enemies just to use them rather than being near a checkpoint. Enemies will also drop loot bags requiring manual pickup but sometimes they'll drop the bag in a glitched or likely lethal pitfall forfeiting whatever goodies they might have had.

However the biggest reason your here is how good or bad the combat is and oh boy let me tell you. First off the combat is heavily reliant on parrys or dodges with some weapons being able to block. Enemies will telegraph an attack with a blue flash if an attack is parryable or red if it isn't and meant to be dodged and blocking can sometimes affect both. The color flashing usually tells you ahead of time and not exactly when the attack lands. Successfully parry an attack and strike back once or sometimes twice but if you attack first you will most likely be counter-attacked for a chunk of damage and you will stagger.

The problem with the combat is almost every attack requires you to wait for something parryable or dodgeable.  The enemies have a poise bar which if taken damage in quick succession and fully depleted offers an instant kill. However enemies almost never flinch or stagger after being hit once or twice and you'll be punished for spamming trying to get them to, but you will stagger for EVERY hit yourself. The other problem is parryable attacks are often too slow to react and unparryable attacks hit you almost instantly which to me if an attack isn't parryable the attack should be slow so you have the time to dodge and faster attacks swing lighter and should be parryable. An enemy type such as a spearman is an example of this flaw and are generally harder than other enemies. It really feels like a dark souls moment where you couldn't get the timing right and just gave up trying to parry altogether but thats the whole premise of this game. You could also just dodge to counteract this but the game doesn't offer any iframes to dodges (as far as I can tell) and it tries to trick you into perfect dodging closer to an enemy to restore stamina. however enemies attacks will sometimes auto-lock to your position when you dodge and hit you anyway. On top of all that enemies will often gang bang you in groups of two or more giving you little breathing room rather than one on one fights which the combat is entirely designed around. 

I'm not going hit this game too hard with my rating as likely much of these problems will likely be changed over time as this game was released not too long ago. Bugs and Balancing will come with time as I really want to make a full playthrough of this game. Most people didn't like or play Ashen because the combat was really jank but the Landscape, Characters and Atmosphere was well worth the time playing it. And I just know this game will likely have that great feeling too for those that give it a chance.

5.5/10 Love the Design but fix some of the jank.
Here are a list of bugs or problems for the Devs
Remove or add an option to toggle the screen position for the movement button. (it does make me a bit nauseous when i have to fight the camera when moving around)
Perhaps make smoother combat music that doesn't sound like every enemy is a boss fight.
Make loot bags spawn inbounds when an enemy is killed in a weird position ie. backstabs or finishers.
Place more smithies especially for the start of the game so we don't have to fight a whole camp just to find out we're missing one ingredient for a new piece of gear. (it probably keep people feeling a bit better too)
Make enemies attacks a little more telegraphable, mostly the human enemies are too slow or too fast and lower the damage for quicker attacks so its not just an instant punish so we can dodge out of the way.
Add a slight time gap in-between character sentences so it doesn't just jump from one line to the next instantly.",1.0
795,137229794,1621990,"I was a little but hesitant to try this one. On one hand the visual style and combat looks fun, on the other it’s been released to mixed reviews. After deciding to give it a try, I can recommend this game, it’s really grown on me.

Visuals:
Love the art style, it’s got this El Dorado vibe that is really fun. Textures and lighting are on point and they leaned into the art style in a beneficial way.

Non-combat Gameplay:
Outside of combat the zones are what I would call “open area”; mostly straightforward but with avenues for exploration and collecting. At first glance the skill trees can be confusing because skills are gated behind weapon mastery, what if you don’t like a particular weapon? However, if you read the tutorial on skills you would find that upgrades apply to all weapons. The system emphasizes exploring other play styles but has enough freedom to let you choose what you like. Oh, and once you clear enemies from an area completely, they don’t respawn. You also don’t seem to loose anything on death.

Combat gameplay: 
This is what will make it or break it for some. The combat is very much focused on 1) Recognizing when to block and when to dodge 2) Learning attack patterns and 3) exploiting 1 and 2 to go ham on an enemy until they are staggered and can be executed. I found that once I really leaned into this combat system instead of treating it too much like a souls game, it was very enjoyable.

Performance:
This is where I think some improvements could be made. I’m running on a Ryzen 5 processor and 3080ti at 4K maxed settings and getting 30-40 fps. I can get a solid 60 if I drop the in game resolution scaling slider, but it feels like my system should be performing better. The AMD superes doesn’t seem to do anything and I’d like to see dlss. Other than that, no crashes or performance degradation.

Bugs and other:
I had one bug where I could no longer attack. I was able to resolve this by pausing and resuming play. Other than that, it think that the ui could be scaled a little better for playing on pc with a 4K tv.  Lastly, sometimes movement can be a little “janky”, not sure what to point to other than sometimes it feels a little off

Conclusion: 
I’m really enjoying this game and the combination of art style, light hearted dialog, combat, and exploration. I like that the skill system encourages exploration, but seems to let you decide which play style you like. I look forward to future updates and content.",1.0

It can create moments of tension, but what's on offer here is slim pickings, at least atm. The real selling point - apart from the Eldritch Mythos themes - it's, well, the price itself. For a meager 8 euros you gain access to a title that offers a good amount of immersion and can be played by up to four (4) players - not bad value considering you can invest a couple evenings into getting everything done with your friends. Devs promise to enrich the experience, so by getting the game now you might actually be gaining access to more varied content in the future. 

If supporting small devs with a creative vision is your thing, and you dig some Lovecraftian action, this little Horror-themed trip my be for you.

801,137231887,1669980,"The elephant in the room here is the translation. It's Meh at best and outright gibberish at worst. 

There is a story and what I do understand is interesting. However, I get the feeling that there's a bunch of stuff I'm just missing? Unless you're meant to just piece things together from npc gossip. There's a few major plot points that I'm just not really sure what the relevance was but that might be because in my first playthrough, I didn't do any combat at all. 

Now, I know this review seems negative so far but here's why I still recommend this game: the mechanics. I really enjoy the combat mechanics. They took a hot moment for me to figure out but it was super satisfying when I did. The stat grinding is also something I really liked, and this IS a stat grinding game so if that's not something you're into, you're probably not going to enjoy this experience very much. The pretty graphics don't hurt either.

This might not be a perfect game but it's one that I liked enough to sink about 12 hours straight in a single day. My main complaint (besides the translation) is that I sure wish I knew which subject stats my lessons are leveling up.",1.0
802,137230270,1669980,"I'll start with reasons not to buy first, then jump to reasons to buy afterwards.

The music is stock music taken from a sound library.

The art varies from very professional to quite bad, but you earn that good art. The bulk of your time is spent in really inconsistent play-dough looking characters and randomly one mode is pixel art.

The game was in no way designed for English letters. The translation is so bad, and some modes, like the aforementioned pixel art mode, take quite a lot of work to get to.

I feel kind of weird about some of the outfits you give to her, that provide necessary stat boosts.

The game is mostly menuing without animations. This is especially blatant in the very optional fighting sections of the game, where enemies have very simple silhouettes and pop in and out of existence.

Cutscenes with animation are very ugly. Kind of hard to tell what's actually going on in some cases, especially since they feature the primary conflict of the game very early on.

The good

You're going to need to finish quite a few playthroughs to get all the endings. My first time, my primary love interest turned into an eldrich horror that made my protagonist pass out and forget everything. Kind of an intense ending.

Lots of romance options for the MC, it's like Harvest Moon on fast forward.

Art can be very good when it wants to be, especially the ending, where judgy kid Rose tells you all about your failures.

Load times are very fast.

Lots of options for playthroughs.

827,137236720,1679290,"This is a good non-WWII wargame that comes close to being excellent, something that's rare outside of tabletop gaming.

Let's start with the negatives. The release feels a bit rushed, and the game would benefit from some polishing. For example, the main menu can be hard to navigate, and feedback on your actions is not always sufficient. You'll need to experiment or look things up online to fully understand the benefits of high ground or damage calculations. While the tutorial videos are well-made, they might not be enough. Additionally, there are some minor bugs, and I've encountered at least one that could be really frustrating in an online match.

However, these issues are not insurmountable, as the game's foundations are solid.

Now, onto the positives. The gameplay is excellent, and that's what matters most in this type of game. Unlike many wargames that rely on randomness, chaos in this game comes from the order system. At the start of each turn, both players prepare a list of orders, without any knowledge of their opponent's orders. This leads to some thrilling decision-making: should you focus on firing at a unit before it moves, or prioritize defense by changing your unit formation? The game is full of such tense moments, as some orders are cancelled if they cannot be carried out anymore.

The game also offers a good amount of content. While the unit variety isn't as extreme as in fantasy wargaming, there's enough to keep things interesting. Cavalry, artillery, and infantry all have unique roles, and there are different subtypes as well. Each nation has its own specialties, which makes playing as a French, Prussian, or Italian army feel unique.

The graphics are also pretty good, considering the non-WWII wargame market.

Something I liked is the voice acting. The developers chose people who actually speak the different languages to read the unit names, and it's a small but cool detail that adds to the immersion. Clicking on a French ""Légion Étrangère"" unit and hearing it pronounced correctly in my language is a nice touch. Even clicking on an ""EIN UND ZWANZIG ZENTIMETER KRUPP MÖRSER"" makes me smile every time.

While I'm not an expert on this period of history, the game's historical accuracy seems reasonable. The rules are designed for games to be played within a reasonable amount of time. This simplification, of course, means the game approximates the realities of battles, but the few battles I've played have already given me some memorable moments, like when my Cuirassiers saved the day or when my Bavarian Linen Infantry held a hill for so long, supporting my artillery against the French.

So, despite some issues, I think this game is great for turn-based wargaming enthusiasts looking for a non-WWII setting.",1.0

831,137237437,2279550,"I have yet to finish Between so I may update this review after doing so, but after streaming 3 hours of the game I have a couple criticisms! First and foremost the game is wonderful, it's clear when playing through that it's translated from Russian but the vast majority of the text is well-translated and makes sense. The plot is scattered yet putting the pieces of the story together is half of the fun! 
My primary criticisms:
 - Certain in game interactions require being very close to the interaction in question so it's easy to get confused and miss things.
 - The motion blur is blinding, accompanied by the speed the character moves at it made me motionsick. At the moment I believe the only way to play the game is by turning it off at the very start. 
 - The camera movement is chunky, when walking out to the back of the map where all you can sea is the sea and distant mountains the camera moves smoothly so I'm uncertain if this is a rendering issue or something with my technology or an issue with the game. In tense moments like when trying to play against time in the Sleep Paralysis demon level having the chunky camera and difficulty turning quickly it stacks the odds against the player and can make the puzzle frustrating. 
 - Despite the missions in the journal and the ability to select them, there's a small lack of guidance. It's not necessarily a bad thing but being able to do anything in any order can make certain steps confusing or lead you to hit walls in progress when you need to figure out a different puzzle first to move forward. This is especially true in the hamster wheel puzzle where I didn't realize you could get inside until someone in chat suggested it, even then the chatter said they felt silly saying it and were shocked that was the solution. 
 - Chairs. Of all the items that can be interacted with that can get in the way the chairs are absolutely outrageous, they can clip through walls, block doorways, get underneath the player, and generally cause havoc. The physics on the chairs are reminiscent of something from a ragdoll simulator and in areas like the computer puzzle in the lab having to fight them to reach the computers is tiring. 
 
All of that being said, I still adored the experience! The puzzles are creative, the story is investing, and there's enough various things to do that when you do get stuck it's easy to swap tasks and give your mind a break. Here are the things I love most about the game
- I adore that the game lets you jump off the map. This is a minuscule detail but I was so happy when I realized, teleporting the character back in front of the house is far more interesting and fun than adding invisible walls and barriers!
 - The scenery of the ocean, the pictures, and all the little detailed items are wonderful. The small details like the useless post-it notes and the pretty sights are like little pieces of the developer left behind! They bring some character to the game and show the true level of effort and detail that was put in, after all most indie games are passion projects!
 - The unique design of the subconscious and how the ""Dreamworld"" of the mind behaves creates a truly investing environment. Some of the glitches or unpolished areas can be written off as the story taking place in one's mind!
 - The option to turn on the bone shine is a really helpful add-on, I have trouble seeing certain things and certain games and having something like that to select helps make the game that much more accessible! 
 - The atmosphere of the game in the lobby is a bit overwhelming, but after entering the game the atmosphere is for the most part an appropriate level and is wonderful! I felt my chest tighten during the night level and I nearly jumped out of my skin the first time I picked up a rabbit and it chattered at me. There are moments that make you feel confused, excited, conflicted, and terrified! This is by far my favorite aspect of the game and it's executed nearly perfectly. 
Overall the game lacks polish, the focus on adding things like telepathy and stuffed rabbit textures is wonderful but I believe more work needs to be done on the foundational features of the game before you're ready for adding things like that. A lot of the issues in the game just need a bit more coding or a couple rules and most of the issues will be solved! I really look forward to a patch release, after the little problems are taken care of I believe that Between will be a shining example of exploration puzzle games! It's really clear to me that this game has the heart and soul of the developers in it, I hope this review helps bring the game to even greater heights! Love, Isaiah.",1.0

Early Access indeed. Has great potential. Sadly the text in the intro is bugged, at one point they replaced the names in the 
story with {???}. The wrapping of any of the text would infringe on other lines below and above it. Overall very difficult to read. But that's very minor all old.

Once the game started I had no idea what the goal of the game was, No direct path to follow, not even a hint of a path. Which i guess is fine, make your own story and all that. But...this feels like the story was missing all together.

Regardless i poked around for a good while did some exploring, failed a bunch of survival checks. Learned how to sleep, and move about the map. Finally found a dungeon only to be stuck because they is no way to move about in it? Was that a big? Did i need to click or press a button? Who knows, there's no guide, or tool tip or....anything.

Basically the jist of this game is figure it out, cause we aren't going to hand hold you. Which would be fine if your controls were intuitive...they are not.

Played over 30 hours over the years, this one is a unique take on what an RPG and life sim could be.
Archmage Rises manages to proceduraly generate a world that makes sense, has history, and people (also monsters) doing their own thing.
You can interact with any NPC, do almost whatever you want if you're willing to get the required equipment/spells/skills.
The sandbox is strong with this one but there are still quests, stories to make you want to push further.
Traveling and dungeon crawling both use a different turn-based systems that would fit right in a TTRPG : intuitive and simple but allowing a lot of things to happen (won't spoil anything).

I love the Runeterra lore to death, and this game, is overall, just amazing, such an experience, I really like the characters, the environments and the bosses, I love how the bosses represent their counterparts in League Of Legends. I will go with a little bit of nit-picking here and say the following;

-It is a shame that sylas never really interacts with the outlaws or gets to know them, you also meet some of them pretty late in to the game.
-The Game itself could use some ironing out on some parts, I believe this will be fixed in the future. But some textures don't layer correctly, and some collision does not work, some textures feel missing and some dialogue has grammatical errors, or typesetting errors.
-The Ultimate mode is sometimes bugged, and using an ultimate doesn't work then (got me killed a few times)

The thing is, like some others, I made triple layers walls so that the enemies have a hard time getting through. Apparently each individual wall counts as a structure. So, if you triple layers walls, you'll only be able to do that for a smaller area because you'll eventually run into the ""structure limit"" and you won't be able to place any towers or other defenses. I found this out 10 hours into the game and now I can't get a refund because I've played for more than 2 hours. Also, this is just one out of multiple other problems I've had with this game but this ""Too many structures"" error just did it for me. Hopefully, this one little review out of thousands of others will contribute to the devs fixing the problems so many people are running into.",0.0

The random generated cities, graphics, game play mechanics and ambience is brilliant and you really feel like you're a nobody detective in this gigantic new city. 

Issues/Improvements Needed:

- Stability: Stability could be better, with constant frame tears as I re-enter the city from a building and other things that will no doubt be fixed at full launch.
- People difficulty: Investigating is a slight issue as when I was interviewing people I needed to, they gave me nothing and constantly upped the price for the information to where I no longer had the amount they needed. This left me to a dead end and although I somewhat enjoy the no hand-holding approach, it may be frustrating to others who have no idea where to go next.
- More interactions in the environment: for example, I couldn't get into a glass door to an office where a victim worked (it was out of hours) and I thought I could just hammer it's glass pane and crouch through but nope, it was indestructible, despite the window next to it being destructible but blocked by blinds. 
- Even more city variation: Self-explanatory, I would love even more tones and settings with suburban areas instead of just high rises and maybe more action in the cities like police arresting people and other things to make it even more alive.

927,137241041,986130,"Fun detective game, huge potential but needs optimisation and more variety.

The game is entirely procedural and provides you with jobs that you can complete to earn money and social standing. Every now and then, you'll be informed of a murder which you can go ahead and solve, which is arguably the most fun part of the game.

Pros:
- Pretty voxel based game with great lighting.
- Fantastic city aesthetic which is great to look at
- The closest you'll get in a procedural game to feeling like a real detective
- Lots of options on how to tackle your objective via stealth, bashing down doors, hacking and more
- Following a case to completion is very satisfying!!!
- Can buy and decorate your own apartment with your hard-earned cash

Cons:
- Already repetitive after around 3 hours. Seeing the same jobs, notes, emails and clues dotted around.
- Limited NPC and world interaction. You can only ask the same generic questions with the same generic answers. They may all have their own lives but they all feel the same.
- Needs more variety in terms of cases and objectives. Let me figure out the motive, give me more dead ends. Add in some dynamic plot twists to the cases. (Perhaps I'm not far in enough to have seen these)
- Poorly optimised. It can take up to 5 seconds for the search box to register that I've typed something.
- Graphical glitches dotted around

The combat is simple but the game forces you to think in what order to kill enemies so you don't have to spam normal attacks when you got no one to steal spells from. Sadly it does not evolve too much during entire play time and does get a little stale and only new spells or stronger enemies liven it up a bit. Every mission/sidequest also plays out the same. While the levels are well done and combat areas are changing I felt that exploration did not yield the satisfaction I was expecting as you are only rewarded with some chests some collectibles and notes.

Spells lets you deck out your build and there are ample of shrines in each level to change them out, however I did not found myself using them too much or as much as I wanted, as gaining mana is a bit hard. Combined with high mana costs you end up hitting the enemy so much that it's not really worth using a spell anymore.
Moreover, some of the spells seem straight up useless, I never found myself using invisibility as it just did not had a use case. You also get way too many ultimates at the same time making so that you don't end up trying them out to the fullest, gaining them a bit more paced out through the game would of felt more rewarding.

Boss fights are incredible however I suggest not playing on hardest mode as the enemies and especially some of the bosses feel sort of spongy.

Great story line, bit of a shame we did not get voice acting that we did in Ruined King but there is not too much reading required and characters never talk about stuff you would not care about. Over all the story is great, and I as a person that kind of hated Sylas from his design to the way he talks in league of legends, or just playing against him (srsly tell me another ap champ that does one shot combos with 200ap), I turned to liking him, I think that the story built him up to be a very likable character. The side characters as well are not some one dimensional NPC's that have their own pasts, character traits and motivations. (If Yops does not get added to league in one way or another I will riot).

Encountered couple of bugs, such as not being able to hit enemies or not being able to target my chains, however this only happened once or twice so it is relatively a bug free experience.

As always like with any other Riot IP the music in this game just slaps. The final boss fight music was just insanely good. 

Over all I give this game 8/10. You can see that lots of work was put in this game from the art to the story. Can't wait to see what else Digital Sun will cook up and what other talented studio will be added to the Riot Forge Roster.",1.0

954,137246421,2163930,"I didn't expect to fight as a T-Rex with a shadow clone against a skeleton king on the moon today, but here we are.

Good solid game, a bit short with 3 levels + 3 mini games at the moment. Really cool day/night mechanic, power ups like 20 Minutes Till Dawn / other similar games, and more of a beatemup rather than a bullethell. 

My main criticism is the game's a bit slow to start until you unlock the 3rd character (at which point you can do more than just roll around waiting for your passives to kill enemies) and rounds are a whole 20 minutes. Not too bad in 20 Minutes Till Dawn, Survivor.io, etc., but the minibosses arent really mini bosses. They're just a high health enemy where you don't need to vary your strategy at all. 

The final boss on the moon is the only one that got me to actually pay attention to it instead of just rolling around gathering health mushrooms until it died. Hopefully more levels and bosses are added like that one, where the orb attack makes you dodge in a specific pattern instead of just rolling away.

The price point is right and you'll get a few hours of fun out of it once you get going with unlocking different characters.",1.0
955,137246042,2377120,"[i]Elena's Journal: To Atlantis[/i] is the second installment of the eponymous series and continues the adventures of Elena and her team of archeologists. While in the first game,  Elena managed not only to uncover the City of the Amazons through a successful expedition but also to find love on the way, the second game will have her embark on a mission to find the legendary city of Atlantis, while also trying to overcome the personal struggles caused by her relationship breaking apart. The games can be played independently of each other, but it's highly advisable to play [i]Unfinished Expedition[/i] before [i]To Atlantis[/i] because the story in the second game reveals many essential aspects of the plot of the first game. 

The gameplay is pretty much the same as in any other GameHouse game. As Elena or one of her friends, you will help their university students or fellow archeologists by fulfilling their requests, combining various ingredients into new items or handing over the objects they need, and then finally billing them at the checkout. As you progress throughout the game, the complexity of available items and combinations increases substantially and the number of people you need to handle simultaneously also grows, while the amount of items you can carry at once also expands.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2966842290
Since Elena travels with her friends all around the world, the locations are now more varied than in other GameHouse games. The first levels take place in some academic environments, followed by her team embarking on a ship towards Atlantis and reaching the dig site in its proximity. We even have some levels taking place in an imaginary world of Atlantis, and an alternate storyline in her mother’s café. I love the diversity of the levels and the specific minigames that each of them brings (one type per location). Additionally, they were more enjoyable than in other games.

Perhaps the weakest aspect of the game lies in its narrative. While I usually greatly enjoy GameHouse stories, I felt like this one was missing a spark, or rather it didn’t manage to convey the fuzzy feelings that the other games do. The story jumps between timelines (present and past) and between reality and fantasy, which gives the narrative less coherence than usual. On top of that, the negative transformation of one of the main characters made me enjoy the story less, despite them having a final redemption arc (albeit fairly rushed). But as usual, the ending leaves one wanting more and opens the story to future chapters.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2966841701
In regards to the difficulty, I must admit that I did struggle a bit with the levels of one location, even on easy mode. I was still able to complete them on the first try but it required an increased focus level. The reason for that was the fact that there are dozens of orders for timed items (place the item in a furnace, then click after three seconds to pick it up otherwise it will be destroyed). While this mechanic is normally encountered only a few times per level, this time you have to literally spam-click them and create them back to back to be able to cover all the requests, while also moving around the level to fulfill all other orders and the main objective. It gets chaotic and quite stressful if one wants to satisfy all customers at five hearts, yet still doable with some extra focus. The rest of the locations have levels of average difficulty, with the ones from the second half of the game being much longer than the ones from the first half (there are more customers and more items), thus a tad more difficult.

As usual with Game House games, the majority of the achievements can be unlocked in one playthrough (which can be done on any difficulty mode). A few remaining achievements require you to replay certain levels multiple times to reach the number of orders needed for a specific item. The story takes around six to eight hours, and for 100% completion, you'll need to spend between an hour or two extra.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2966841667
Overall, [i]Elena's Journal: To Atlantis[/i] is a very decent game. The gameplay is as entertaining as always and the graphics are beautiful, with clear and big icons for the items. In some aspects, it has a weaker story than usual and some of the levels are above-averagely challenging.

957,137246069,2020710,"Very addictive. It feels like the game balance will be improved eventually since it appears difficult to lose, if at all.

Very good and polish start. Everything made sense. The progression was very clear and figuring out everything took very little effort.

While the progression is polished, except for the end game, it does feel like more gates will be added to limit how quickly someone can research and progress. That might be needed as the game feels less like a game and more chill. Still incredibly fun.

Some complaints:

- buying the power station doesn't make sense. It provides 10 energy at the base but the setup and cost to keep it running is off the charts. It doesn't make sense to build it out.

- the deep appears bugged. The bots don't really manage the deep very well. It appears if you build them and stay in the deep, then they stay but will surface when you do and stay out of the deep and not manage it. It is possible that I need to pay attention to the priorities settings. However the priorities order may as well not exist as it is not per building or I could be misunderstanding. I didn't look at it too closely but it appears to be categories.

- there could be more quality of life improvements but honestly not really needed as it is almost impossible to fail. It would be nice to optimize like you can in other games, this appears like that Evil Genius game and suffers from similar problems. Except the workers don't get stuck like in Evil Genius 2. But they do mostly ignore the deep, so that could be a bug.

- cranes are limited. I get it. My machine is old AF and can't power the high settings. I was hoping to replace all of the workers with bots but that seems like it would not be feasible. This seems like it is balanced in that case because while you could throw a bunch of bots at everything, the game as it is now would be a really bad idea. Cranes also can't optimize much as they as slow and the amount you can have are super limited. I was hoping to fully automate the deep but that doesn't seem possible at the moment.

Conclusion:

- I was impressed. It does seem like they don't have lose conditions as you can't run out of any resource. The traders upgrade to including resources so as long as you have products, you can continue to progress.

- I beat it. I am going to wait a few months before jumping back into it. I did a few expeditions and I am looking forward to this later. I did everything you can do at the moment and loved every minute.",1.0

987,137248214,2301190,"i don't even know why i'm bothering to write such a long and critical review over a less than one dollar game, but i suppose the experience was frustrating enough to motivate me to
i'll talk about the controls and the player character first. there is no tutorial prompts, or even a way to check keybinds in the settings, or in game. while taken for granted, telling the player the have to hold RMB to aim the gun at the cursor, instead of firing in the direction your moving, is a very important thing. also, the player character feels sluggish in ways that do not feel, or play well, for example, trying to switch weapons. i know were not playing a Mr john call of duty, but it still feels excessively slow, especially when the mule is barreling down on me and i would like to pull out my shotgun to use for its intended purpose. this, coupled with the fact that the act of turning around and shooting takes time and does not feel responsive, means that you easily get put into situations of ""pop a flare and hope the help comes from the direction your running into in time, because the moment your stamina runs out your dead"" and along with that, the weapons feel ineffectual, even beyond the intended purpose. barring the very start, the pistol can't keep up with slowing the mule down, the AR, while effective, requires you to resupply off the dead infantry, and the shotgun feels inconsistent, to say the least, there are times where it will readily reduce the mules speed, but sometimes it just eats the hit with no reduction to their speed, leading to death
second, the collision on the environment is wonky at best, i find myself getting stuck in spots clearly past the branch in the way, or caught on corners i had no idea existed, and not much in terms of visual clues to tell either, unless i had gotten stuck there and most likely, died there before. and some spots you can wiggle through in you move in a particular way, and example being the well with the snack and ammo in the graveyard, once the coffins come up, you can't get in or out from the top way, unless you wiggle and walk in a particular way.
third, the actual mule(?) itself, with which i have issues and gripes. the former problem with map geometry seemingly does not apply to Willickers, i swear I've seen him get through gaps and spots that i myself would easily get stuck on. as for player readability, that is also an issue. while i can figure and assume the the mule's max speed and acceleration go up over time, any other factors are hard to tell. if i shoot it while its stopped and it rears up, did i just ""enrage"" it and make it gain a chunk of speed? Does shooting it cause it to get faster? it gets skinnier the more you blow it up with barrels and shoot at it, so maybe, who knows? and the magical child grab. i understand the reason for it, its to put pressure on the player and keep them on their twos if the mule is off screen, so they don't think they're safe merely because they have distance, but when it can do this from just off the edge of the screen, and then still come running in full speed, means there are times where you can just insta-lose, especially if approached from the top or bottom
and speaking of the camera, and information given, it is severely lacking in some ways. for example, having no idea the general direction, or speed at which they're approaching, is something that i think is important to tell the player, if your going to limit their visible FoV. along with that, knowing the direction that support is coming from would be a very important to know, especially if they're the only thing standing between you and an all expenses paid trip back to to start of the timer
on that subject, in my frustrated rush to simply ""go next"" on the next run and mashing space, i discovered a broken and seemingly nonfunctional UI to save, a feature that might've made all the former jank more tolerable, as at least then i could save after doing the initial looting phase, saving me the time and hassle of doing that every single time and letting me focus on routing and figuring out how the mule works
honestly, i still don't quite know why i bothered to write all this up when i could've just refunded this and been on with my day, but i guess i wanted to somewhat advise people on what await them inside",0.0

The game is simply not for them. [i]However, I can see where their complains are coming from if you'd read on...[/i]


Why so negative then? Very simple answer: performance and stability.
In this one game session of six hours so far I've encountered two full blown crashes (and there is no auto-save). The performance is also absolute dogshit in 60% of the time. Basically any time you're outside or inside a large hallway/ hub area you get a nice 15 to 20 frames slideshow (and that's on a 3060). The UI and user experience is also very lackluster in many places. An example would be opening pinned notes on the case board can open them behind the UI elements and makes it difficult to move around. Or how the strings connecting notes can disappear unexpectedly when you show/ hide unrelated strings (this might be intentional but then it's r*tarded by design). Dialogue is also rather buggy with one tenant repeating themselves three times about confirming that the victim is their neighbor. On the topic of dialogue, people are way too negative in the world. Nearly everyone you talk to want you out of the way with dialogue much like ""None of your business"". Just a little more reasoning behind their answers would be nice to hear.

Not a bug per say but for random jobs you pick up that tell you to find a breifcase for more information the photos can be many times incredibly poorly angled and you have to figure things out yourself. The size of the breifcase is also surprisingly tiny and very randomly placed in the location you're shown so finding it can be very difficult sometimes. Something to keep in mind.

If you're [i]extremely[/i] interested in the game and have been eyeing it for some time and you also have at least something like an RTX card or thereabout then I'd say go for it, the gameplay when it works is really great. However, if you've recently found the game or is on the fence about it, don't get it. Wait 'til stability is improved and so that performance is at least playable in the busy/ large areas. The game is in Early Access after all and it rightfully needs some more time in the oven.

Edit: After lowering from 4k to 1920x1080 the game actually runs completely fine on the 3060 and thanks to the game's voxel style the lower resolution is not noticeable (though I do really think that going to 4k should not make this game into a slideshow. Pretty sure the rendering is flawed and incredibly inefficient). However, these ""good"" news also come with some bad news. I believe my save file must've been corrupted and any time external footage needs to be taken or rendered, it would seem, the game hard crashes. It happens whenever I try taking any photo (tried multiple times) and it also happened when I attempted to view CCTV footage.",0.0

Now, where shall I begin wih the red flags? The game is a buggy mess that lags even on RTX 3080/R7 5800X3D machine, but that's not the main problem, really.

UI/UX and navigation are atrocious, like a Dementor (yeah, read another book!) it sucks any sort of fun and enjoyment out of the game. There are no way to track clues on a map in a remotley predictable way. Clues managenent and reading through information about your victim is a puzzle by itself, more difficult than the most cases at hand. Look, when it's a huge problem to find your own apartment or almost anything relatable on the map, you have an issue. I do hope that the dev will hire someone to actually plan the damn UI, let alone draw one in a workable maner. 

UI scale on a 4K display is tiny, the interactive elements are either too hard to see or stand out too much. Inventory management is kinda ass and feels broken.

There are also tons of game-breakling bugs. Tutorial case can softlock you (like, a lot). 

What else? Well, I really thought that the scale of the city would be much bigger, but that's EA game for you. Right now it's 4 by 4 blocks, feels very cramped tbh. There is also stark lack of sounds, soundtrack (and music direction) and first-person animations.

At this point this game is more like a paid demo for a proof-of-concept. Some things do seem to function, but that's it. It's broken, boring and simply frustrating to navigate around almost every mechanic or concept here.

At the moment, you can't rebind your keybinds, and there are no end level screens. The game is challenging, especially for people not used to old fps games, but thankfully if you die you respawn near and with full health.",1.0

https://rumble.com/v2k8cpk-lichenvale-gameplay-indie-hack-and-slash-part-1.html 

A new indie first-person hack & slash game that (I think) aims to be one of those hard games. That, or I think the game has some balancing problems (or I'm a complete noob). I'm talking about the fact that is so hard to counter ranged enemies projectiles (or, again, I'm too noob). Though even if the game feels hard, every time you die you spawn back in the same place with the enemies that were left when you died, but with a few points deducted from you (every time you kill enemies or pick some coins or crystals you get points). This is another mechanic that I'm confused on. Why would I care if I die or not because it seems that I have enough points to keep coming back to life 100+ times. I also wanted to see more character upgrades or more weapons in the game. I've been playing for almost an hour and I found only some max HP increase. Eventually I've finished the game but I can't say that I had much fun. Either it's too hard for me or this game has problems.",1.0

- In a flooded cellar, the water stops without reason at some point (no gameplay consequence)
- Loading a saved game doesn't work sometimes. Make sure you have multiple save games
- Also the save games seem to not contain the whole game state. Sometimes the loaded game is in a very different state, than when I saved it. For example in the tutorial mission I saved in the victims apartment. When I load the game, the police in front of the door ready to break in. Which was absolutely not the case, when I saved it.

However, there are some glaring issues present here. first off is performance and bugs, those will get better with time but I feel the game has soft locked me out on the tutorial case, (the safe I have a passcode for doesn't take the pass code), and while it's cool this game really does just leave you to your own devices, it shouldn't for the tutorial. this is the first time I have had to ask to be handheld in a game but getting information and resources to try and put together what has happened in a case, is difficult to say the least, but more annoying than anything. part of that is the UI is such a mess and navigating the space is as well. idk maybe I have played to many modern video games but the difficulty in investigating here is annoying. Also, can we have the option to be on the side of the police in this game? it's annoying to go back to crime scenes and be harassed by the obligatory sentry at the door. and sure getting creative with breaking into places is cool but it just takes a lot of time.

I guess my biggest complaint rn is that the game just is sooooo slow, and starts to feel like it doesn't respect your time. I can't reccomend it in it's current state because it is frustrating to get anywhere or anything done in this game.

the suggested changes I would make are:
*better map and navigation UI. The arrow compass on the bottom of the screen ain't gonna cut it. Actually give me either a plotted path to the front door of the location or a waypoint to it's front door. it doesn't need to show me every way to break in, just get me to the front door!
*crawling through ducts is slow and tedious. speed it up or just have better and shorter duct layouts. As someone who works in HVAC, duct doesn't snake around as much as this game thinks it does.
*why do cammera breakers slowly creep back up? for as immersive as this game is that just ticked me off that I would have to keep going back to the breakers and just turning them back off.
*everyone in here are hp sponges. I get you don't want people to just punch their way through everything but everyone could do with their hp bars cut down to half or 2/3 of what they are now.
*why so many statuses? they are annoying and again, seek to waste time. could add a feature to turn them off if people don't want to play with them.
*with any puzzle there should be a hint system. again, at least the tutorial should baby you through more than it does, just so it is clear how the process of filling out the case report should go, everything you need to hand in a successful case.",0.0

The ides of the puzzles is good and entretaining, the way they can engage with people and use and learn different cyphers and puzzles is cool and interesting. Although I feel that hints should be locked by time as right now they can be skipped easily.

UI and UX are really good, it feels as if someone actually created an entirely new, and functional, Operating System. The typing sound and overall sound design is good, I liked it a lot and the klacking of the keys felt satisfying. The songs are not my style, but some of them do fit the game's aesthetic.(and I can't believe someone's beans got burnt:(( )

Me, myself, only saw one typing mistake on the main tour of it, none other later on. I still am surprised that this has Twitch intergrations too, that was an unexpected, but welcome move.

I also feel like the button and signaling to go in the puzzles webpage can be a little bit more on your sight instead of it blending with the other choices, same thing with the cypher's solve or mix page which I discovered after I finished my run, lmao

Sadly the Psychological horror idea felt like it popped in and it doesn't really gives the tension you'd feel it would, although the imagery used was real good to make you feel uncomfortable as I think it's the whole idea of it. The Cyphers and puzzles are interesting, although I feel like some need more of an explanation for people like me who don't really know cyphers (mostly cause I'm stupid.)

This is a hard one for my to review given my bias for league, sylas, and how hyped I was for this release. But I'll try to be as objective as I can. Let's start with some pros/cons

[h1]The Good[/h1]

10/10 Art & Animations - I'm not a pixel art fan, but I haven't seen anyone do it better than this game.
8/10 Story - It's a well executed cast of characters and memorable tension.
10/10 Boss fights - I loved fighting iconic champions and seeing their fantasy re-imagined in this game.
8/10 Combat - The basic flow of combat makes you feel like a very powerful version of sylas.

[h1]The Regretable[/h1]

0/10 Environment & Level design - There are 5 maps and they are heavily recycled.
2/10 Enemies - There are <20 enemies in the game. Fighting them becomes very boring very quickly.
3/10 Voice Acting - There is very little of it, which is regrettable for a story focused game.
0/10 Side quests - No opportunity to explore a side story. Just copy paste environment & fights.
STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS ARE INCOMPLETABLE WITHOUT DLC. Not really a huge deal, but ?????

Now I have to ask my self, do I recommend this game? It's still very hard. If I think just about my memory with the boss fights and the important story beats then yes I think so. However, every level quickly felt like just a chore to get through. If this game could have just been me reading a book with the occasional boss fight I think that would have been much better.

I've landed on: At $10 this game delivers an upvote. But only if you also are deeply invested in league of legends lore and really want to see the iconic characters be developed further.",1.0
1081,137252285,1681060,"Gameplay is bland and gets boring really fast.  
Gate trips are texted based with very limited choices.  You better enjoy looking at the base because that's all you'll see.
The angle and camera controls are frustrating.  Never feels like you can fully enjoy the visuals of the base.
The audio feels like I'm miles away.  Even gate activation feels dull and distantly quiet.

Simply wonderful. This game on the hardest difficulty is the best way to enjoy it. Once I turned it down it immediately became a lot less fun. It's not like Dungeons where the hardest difficulty isn't that hard, here; it is actually hard. It forces you to enjoy the quality of life and explore the entire world in order to get more powerful so that you can defeat the piglins. The building in this game is a super fun mechanic and you can get a little creative with it, but I wish there were more options. 

It felt like I had to actually prepare to siege the fortresses on the hardest difficulty and nothing was easy, it made it much more satisfying to take a step forward.

If I had kept it on the hardest difficulty, I easily could've put more hours into my playthrough.

Holding a button also makes a timer tick down, but as long as you're not moving anything around, you have as much time to think as you'd like.

It's really enjoyable all the way through. The early levels ease you into concepts, and if you ever are stuck on a level too long, you're offered a picture of an intermediate game state you can shoot for that should help you finish it.

Currently this is one of the best Detective games i have ever played and it all comes down to scale. All the voice acted interrogations and scripted movie moments in the world don't compare to the lake of complexity and depth this game already has and the ocean that it can become.

Playing around with all the evidence and strings as you piece things together is SUBLIME. It gives me the sense of accomplishment that I've missed in a lot of detective games because they feel like a ride at a theme park. They don't allow you to feel like you are a real detective, only dressed like one.

This Game however? There are so many ways to gather evidence and directions that YOU and you alone can take this case to its conclusion. The guide rails are off and its free roam detective time! You want to spend five in game hours on a stakeout for your prime suspect to get home from work? You can! Want to break into an entire floors apartments to narrow down where your target is keeping his corporate files? You Can! Want to dig through emails and rubbish bins to find every scrap of intel on a tough case? YOU CAN!!! The freedom to do anything to progress the case gives you so many ways to make your own fun, fun that will never really drop off because these cases are YOUR cases!

Here you have to worry about not pissing people off as much as where your next meal will come from and how to gain power as a mage (through political manipulation, magical pursuits or conquest). My closest analog is adventure mode in Dwarf Fortress, but specifically targeted at capturing the experience of what it would be like to live as a wizard.

The simulation and procedural generation here is pretty impressive. Not only is the world custom made on demand, but quests and even some type of enemies are generated based on what's going on in the world. As an example, bandits are actually drawn from townfolk/peasants if the economy starts becoming hostile.

All that said, it is still pretty early. There will be bugs, and core systems/functionality are still being implemented. But the team is fantastic at giving feedback and incorporating feedback from fans.

[h1]Disciplining unruly employees, one hypnosis at a time[/h1]
[b]Hypno-Mart[/b] is a short visual novel in which we play a manager who deals with a rude, bratty part-timer he can't fire because no one else is willing to work the night shift. However, he opts to teach her a lesson by hypnotizing her and banging her silly like the ugly bastard he is.

Plot-wise, it's similar to most nukige in the sense that the plot isn't deep and moves from one sex scenario to the other right away. That said, this visual novel has a bit of character development in the latter half when you have to pick choices that lead to any of the three endings available. On the downside, some words slightly go out of bounds or get cut in odd ways, as in moving their last letter to the next line.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2966894010
The visuals are as good as you'd expect from a nukige. I especially like Airi's design because her design is a bit different than the typical anime character. The H-scenes are very well-drawn and focus on the different predicaments the protagonist puts Airi in, ranging from having her pleasure him to putting her in humiliating situations. Unfortunately, the sex scenes are censored and the mosaics can't be removed.

[h1]Verdict: Good for nukige fans[/h1]
[b]Hypno-Mart[/b] is the kind of game fans of the genre and stories where hypnotism is the main focus will enjoy because of the quality of its art. However, those who aren't might want to wait for a sale before purchasing it due to its short duration and mosaic censorship.",1.0

This will definitely be one of those easy to learn but hard to master type games. Plus, with all the zipping around, I can see speedrunners taking onto this to see if they can push just that bit harder for a higher score or faster time.

1129,137253971,1308360,"The gameplay demo for this was so misleading. The entire concept of linear missions (which is the only thing the demo consisted of btw and was marketing itself on) is basically gone from the game and replaced with only single room arenas.

The beatmaps feel sluggish with tons of blank space that wasn't even there in the demo version of the tracks that leaves you basically unable to play the game until you can fire your gun again.

Also for some reason you don't even need to time the gun play to the rhythm anyways. You can just hold down the shoot button and the guns fire regardless, basically removing the need for any rhythm from this rhythm game that fails to give you playable beats for like half of the songs.

Bys what happened? I was so excited for this, the demo was like 90% of the way there, the blueprint for this was written for years in stuff like BPM.

1145,137253838,2374580,"Claustrophobia the game, beating this nightmare gave me a new perspective on life, anything better than being stuck in the tiny tunnels. It feels like the world-building is intentionally empty or lacking the character to create a feeling of uncomfortable space and anxiety. It slightly reminded me of HellNight for PS1, mostly because 90% of this game is moving through tiny tunnels and almost no visibility, it's almost like playing as a food that is moving through an intestine, and I have to say game was extremely immersive, I figured it had no monsters early on, but sometimes I felt like I had to look behind my back because it's just so weird.

That said, I must give a bit of a warning for anyone that wants to try it, the navigation in this game is not exactly friendly, there is a huge exploration area with low visibility, and the layout of the map is not good for orientation. I can't tell you how many times I missed a path because I just could not see it or walked in a complete circle. It got so hard I was considering drawing my personal map, eventually, I managed to memorize the layout, but it took a few hours. On top of that, some of the puzzles and mechanics require a little bit of imagination, the game does not hold your hand, so expect a bit of challenge there as well.

(If I can give a small piece of advice for playing this game, have paper and pencil ready, and hug every wall, all of them, hug every wall that you see because you will miss something).

For me to explain exactly how this game works might be a bit of a spoiler in itself, I think part of the charm of this game is figuring out how the 2 character mechanics interact together. It can be a bit confusing at first, but once you understand the basic idea, the game is not very complicated. Essentially you have a tall character and a small robot that goes into tiny places you can't go, and that is more or less the core of the game. Interestingly the game has some point&click elements combined with a first-person exploration, sometimes it's not intuitive because the robot can press certain things that are out of his range.

So my save file said I beat the game around 90 minutes, but the actual time was closer to 4 hours or so, and even that might be a bit optimistic, there are so many ways to get stuck. I also missed some optional area, hopefully, it has something interesting because the ending was.. well, a little ambiguous. 

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

(+) Now, I can't imagine this game will resonate with many people, but it reminded me of those dreadful games such as HellNight, and unfortunately, I have some nostalgia for games that make you navigate endless tunnels where you can't see much of anything. I am actually not a big fan of games that are too dark, I avoid them if anything, but it feels like that design choice here was not just the lack of effort, but an intentional decision to create an uncomfortable and immersive game, I have never seen someone commit to that feeling of emptiness and just constant claustrophobia so much, outside of games like Isolania or Lost in Vivo.

What I am trying to say, I am not sure if people will appreciate the mood and vibes of this game, I think there is a bit of an acquired taste there, but I personally really enjoyed the atmosphere, very unapologetic **** the player, find the way yourself. 

(+) So for the puzzles, I guess you can look at it 2 ways. Yea, they can be kinda frustrating, but I thought the game was very unique as well, if you can inspect the hints carefully, it's not too hard, and I liked thinking outside the box. You definitely want to pay attention and record anything you find, and memorize the areas as well.

(+) There were some parts of the level design that felt more immersive, moving through constantly small spaces and the overall changing perspective made the game feel very different. I do think you could have done a better job with the overall layout, I think the game is very difficult to navigate for the first few hours. 

[h1] Feedback: [/h1]

[u] Nitpicks [/u] - might want to adjust the elevator controls, you can't interact with it if you are too close, and you have to finish moving in one direction before moving again. Also, if you run out of the elevator, you can softlock yourself. There are a bunch of areas where you can escape the map, mostly any joints between the areas. For one of the harder puzzles, the one with the 3x3, I didn't get the logic for the second hint, solved it with 50%+brute forcing. 

[u] Navigation [/u] - um, so in this case I actually like that how you designed the game around tiny places and crawling all over the place, the only thing that annoyed me is that some paths are just not visible at all if you moving around, you very much have to hug the walls here. Maybe at least a small object to point the player into the hard-to-see areas, use those random neons more.

And a small note for the ending, I mean I like that you left it for the player to interpret, but I don't know, I expected just a bit more context considering the treacherous journey.

[b] Overall Thoughts: 8/10 [/b]

This is the game that will probably make you angry a few times, but also a rewarding game to beat because of how challenging it is to navigate, almost like you escaped from an endless nightmare. I probably enjoyed this game more than a person with objective reasoning would,  it reminds me of certain elements that I don't see very often,  the game feels very unapologetic with navigation and overall experience, and if you give it a chance it can be very moody. The puzzle mechanics were very creative and maybe a bit frustrating, but they are not hard if you can think outside the box. I played many games that were similar, but not this committed to just having so many tiny places to crawl into, so I kinda enjoyed the whole turd-in-tunnel gameplay.

1150,137255332,986130,"I've only played for the first few hours. This may change after 10s of hours.

I tracked down contact of first victim, spoke to them, later broke into their  apartment early in the morning after having been in the sewer. At the same time, the murderer also broke into their apartment and shot them in front of me, all while complaining about the smell. I chased the murderer into the lobby, punched them unconscious, but then I got mobbed by helpful citizens.

I wound up arrested and the murderer has walked free, but I know what they look like and I have a first name only. I don't know how I'll track them down, but I will.

Performance suffers in a few areas, but the experience it gives of being a freelance detective trying to solve crimes is unparalleled. As the game gets more polish and more systems are added it will continue to improve.

Currently there's a few quirks. You can use a computer while someone else is sitting at the desk. Most citizens are really unwilling to give you their name for $50, but will happily take $30 to let you poke around the backroom of their workplace unsupervised. Procedural generation may generate a toilet block with 1 stall and 5 sinks.

Unlike a scripted detective game, you can easily waste time chasing down red herrings. Making your own murder board with bits of evidence, you can flood it with irrelevant crap, or customise it. There's a heap of tools you can use, maps, blueprints air vents.

I hope that future version continue to iterate on the systems.  Different security systems, locks, people perhaps being more willing to share information. Perhaps a grievance system, so people close to the victim adopt different routines temporarily.  But I'm excited to see what the game will become. Even if it doesn't change from what it is now, you will get your value from it",1.0

Everything about this is absolutely fantastic. The whole city feels alive and the the amount of items and methods to solve your cases and do your jobs is unlike anything I've played before. It feels like it was made by asking ""How would you do that in real life?"" rather than ""How did you do that in a previous successful game""?.

It's immersive, it allows you to play at your own pace, and it offers such a rich procedural generation. It's perhaps the best use of PG I have yet seen in a game.

Early access? If they are to make improvements on the game, I would suggest the obvious improvements in the performance. I don't have serious issues myself, but there is definite slow downs at times. Other than that just make it even more immersive. Add MORE life orientated stuff. Purchasable. Perhaps more individualistic personalities. And of course the steam workshop. This game is almost the definitive example of a game with infinite replayability... all it requires is the steam workshop. I can just imagine the possibilities with mods for this game... Not to downplay the possibilities already realised. A real gem, especially if you like detective noir.

1153,137254952,986130,"I'd never heard anything about this game until I saw it pop up on steam on EA release. The concept sounded amazing and so far I'm not disappointed at all. Right out the gate, the attention-to-detail is crazy, especially for a procedurally-generated game. I spent close to an hour in the tutorial just inspecting stuff in my apartment and marveling at how in-depth and intuitive the systems for gathering evidence are. There's also a fair amount of compelling backstory and world-building that it's completely optional for you to interact with, which doesn't really have much mechanical impact on the game (as far as I know so far) but is very refreshing to poke around in and figure out on your own.

This is all stuff that impressed me before even interacting with the world and characters and meat of the gameplay, which I don't really need to go into too much detail on other than to say it's exactly what you're thinking it is from the descriptions, with a high level of polish and really intuitive UI and tutorial. It's not even bad to look at, despite everything being composed of voxels, thanks to really coherent art design and atmospheric lighting. 

Aside from framerate issues which I expect will be fixed, this feels like a full-featured product at launch and one that I'll get much more than my money's worth from. I'm super excited to see how things develop in EA and this is a big fat recommendation from me.",1.0

Okay that out of the way, do I recommend the game, holy **** yes. It feels like DF adventure mode had a baby with DnD and it scratches an itch I didn't even realize I had. You are an adventurous apprentice cast into the world before you're ready and oh boy do I hope you're ready to realize that a couple of magic missiles is not in fact an adequate response to three skeleton warriors ambushing you out of the dark in the first dungeon you explore.

That being said read the disclaimer. You will encounter bugs, possibly game breaking ones quite often at the moment. The dev is very friendly and fired off a hotfix within a few hours of releasing but I have no idea if that's really a manageable time frame long term (probably not), although given the amount of effort put into getting it this far in the first place, I can't imagine any of the really game breaking ones will survive the week (or month), or at least not until the next big step on the roadmap gets implemented. 

Area for improvement that will immediately stand out but isn't game breaking:

The tutorial is... well, there's not really one.  That said, if you pay your folks the minimum wage, and send three scientists on every away mission, especially at the beginning, you should have no problems making enough science and (therefore) patents... money.  

I start with two science teams (6 low pay scientists), then soon a 7th to stay at home and just research.  In no time I've unlocked the other occupations and critical base upgrades.   Once you've got mining up and running you can run a full team of engineers to just make cash money by mining ore 24/7. 

Yes, the game is silly making you research a tread mill.  Yes, 3 soldiers isn't enough.  You'll take some casualties.  But they're easily replaced, and they level up quick.

I like the added gameplay of needing to keep track of items characters either lost or gave to the player. I wasn't much help, considering I either forgot to give them or just thought said characters didn't fit the item.
My point is, this game really involves the player on a different level. Playing a bartender, but instead of serving alcohol, you serve coffee.
I'm so curious about the character's lives and stories they have to tell. And the character we play!
The only thing I really wish this game had was a bit more game play besides making coffee/tea. I understand that's the general gist of this game, but maybe the further along we go, maybe the player could have an option to choose their responses to the characters?

1219,137258416,1669980,"This is a great game if you were a fan of Princess Maker. I played Princess Maker all throughout my childhood and adored it, so it was sad to me when it was difficult to find games like it. Sure, there are handful of games out there that are well enough, but in my opinion none of them ever come close to Princess Maker... until Volcano Princess. Playing this game brings back that sense of nostalgia from my childhood, and unlike other recent games there is a clear true ending to strive for. It brings new mechanics into an old genre and it fits so well together. 

Now, I will say a few things. I really recommend this game, but I feel I do need to point out that out of the few playthroughs I've done now I have come across a few bugs. The most notable one is the fact that letters will come in  and if you click on it the words will not appear and it will break the game. There has been a fix created to help with this. However, another bug I came to was the fact that my game was seemingly skipping over the ""Volcano Festival."" I'm still trying to figure out if this has something to do with the fact that I changed my birthday month in my second playthrough and it skipped over the month of October because of it. Either way, it is a bug that needs to be fixed. The festival is a big part of the lore and gameplay, and it feels like your missing out when you can't even go. The game still runs fine regardless.",1.0
1220,137258177,1669980,"This is an amazing game that is, dare I say, more fun than the original Princes Maker series. The game takes everything you love about PM2, and adds upon it. 

PROS:
Sophisticated stat system
Easy to understand
Areas in the town unlock as you progress through the game
Turn based combat 
Making friends that you take on adventures, each with different skills
Festivals that test your daughter, along with minigames
Wide variety of unique characters that feel like real people
Incredibly adorable father/daughter relationship. Also the option to be a bad dad
Lots of different paths for your daughter to go down, and  balanced with every gameplay
Unique story with its own twist. Choices you make heavily impact your daughter and story
Side quests in the Knights college that help advance your daughter in a certain direction
Lots of things to do in the town map
Romance is very in depth. The game also rewards you with gifts as you advance every relationship
Cooking and Crafting
Lots of straight and lesbian romance routes

CONS:
Dice minigame is hard to understand, even with the guide I'm still confused. I end up avoiding it every playthrough

Horse racing is very hard, even with novice races you have to have an extremely fast horse to win, which is not available until you have at least 40 MND. Also I spent like 2000 gold leveling up my horse and still couldn't win. Hopefully they make this more balanced

You can date practically everyone in the town. The reason I put this in the con section is because there are some weird match ups involving people a lot older than you, and you can start romancing these people once you hit age 12 lol. So yeah there are some huge age gaps and it gets kinda freaky for my taste. The only plus side is that you can't groom your own daughter like in the original PM2

No magic classes in the game. If you want to fight in the forest, you have to build up your STR, which sucks  because INT and CHA have no place in battle

This game is very long. It took me several days to finish one playthrough. I actually kind of like this because the game is very in depth, but I made it a con because some people may not like this when pursuing multiple endings

Battle requires a lot of grinding to progress, although they offset this by spending purple stones to level up characters not in use. The problem is that you have to grind to get the stones, and you can't purchase them

Overall I think this is a great addition to the Daughter Raising Simulator genre, and really scratches that itch I've been craving in a game for a while now. The only thing they could add to make this game perfect (imo) is the ability to decorate your room. I think it would be super cute to acquire different stuff to place in there to personalize it. They kinda do this with the Alchemy station, but you can't see any of the decorations visibly. That's just me though",1.0

It is essentially MW2019 Multiplayer but with good maps that actually seem to have some thought put into them and cranked mode pacing. The monetization isn't egregious either, with packs only costing 1-5 dollars instead of Activision's insane $20-40 packs. There isn't much to hate about the game, it has a good skill ceiling with its movement mechanics being key to doing well. Even spawns are well thought out and make sense. 

My only complaint would be that with a game of this pacing, you can't have a spawn protection system of this caliber. You can't kill an enemy who just spawned in for about 3 seconds from what I've counted. This is insane when you're on a nuke streak and you die 1 kill off because the game forces you to give your enemy a 3 second head start with god mode on. At most make it 1 second of God Mode, as it kills the flow of the game when an enemy spawns behind you, you turn on them and make every shot, yet lose the gunfight since they had God Mode Spawn protection. Fix that and I genuinely don't have any complaints. It's MW2019 but better in a lot of ways and Free to Play!",1.0

The Lighting make the scenes come to life as well. Very well animated animals, moving clouds ! - that is for me in any game a MUST ! Cool inovative inventory system, some climbing, Good mushroom effects :D, items felt good, like real objects, some physics to them, like opening the compass - I just couldn't stop playing with it !

Swimming OK, but would be nice to control also backward/side/down swimming.

1234,137259229,2277740,"I can only genuinely describe this game as a plant based, family-friendly version of Postal 2.

The breakdown:
I cannot decide on whether they paid the voice actors too much or too little, the delivery of some lines are on par with The Rocky Horror Picture Show or The Room. Exclamations do not receive any specific attention and are delivered in a manner only categorized as ""exhaustively bored"". ""Boss boss, the rabbits have escaped!"" is delivered with a tone only rivaled by a tranqed up Text to Speech bot.
The controls on the bike are absolutely mind boggling and it only takes a meandering donkey pedestrian to get it permanently stuck, forcing you to carry your cargo in hand or reset.
The writing is unbelievably silly, the plot is wild, and the human models look like Play-Doh that's been left in the sun too long. The background stuff is funny like store announcer specifically mentioning that they copy security cards, the names of various stores, or the entire city being comprised of streets that were named with the first things someone saw when they broke open their spice cabinet.
This game could be so bad and goofy that's good, but it needs one feature. A punch button. Being able to full on deliver a knuckle sandwich that makes the game models freak out or send their ragdoll bodies across the screen would instantaneously make this game GOTY contender.

What slaughters this game's enjoyment of the hilariously poor voice acting, bewildering storyline and character choices, and the potential to be goofy stupid fun is the actual gameplay. It's mostly walking, getting on the subway and waiting for the game to load, more walking, talk to someone, walk some more, etc... I cannot fathom how this, a game with a dinky 100MB of files, needs to load that often. At heart, it's a chore simulator and doesn't do much to detract from the mind-numbing requirement to walk from point A to point B with nothing but spamming ""Ask For Donation"" inbetween.

Ahh they have bourbon! Now that will keep me warm on this cold night. I step outside and glug the entire thing, throwing the empty bottle back inside the open door of the store.

I'm very woozy now and can barely stand up. I stumble around occasionally dropping to the ground and then picking myself back up. I throw trash cans, trash bags, and boxes out of my way as I try to get my bearings. I stumble in and out of a bookstore. While the inebriating effects of the booze aren't wearing off, the warmth they provided is, so I stumble over to a burning barrel to get warm.

There's a guy standing nearby. I can sort of make him out amidst the swirling voxels spiraling in front of my face. Then I hear gunshots. I look over, and there is a man in a trench coat standing there with a gun in his hand. He fires a couple more shots and the guy goes down, blood pooling around his body. The man walks away as if nothing happened!

My first case has now started, and boy is it going to be an easy payout since I witnessed the killing first hand. I stumble down the street after the man.  He gets suspicious of me and starts to run away. I stagger behind him as he weaves in and out of buildings. I wait outside a bathroom stall as he relieves himself and then continue the pursuit.

After several minutes of chasing and one bathroom break, I have finally had enough. I decide it is time for my fists to put an end to this, but it's really hard to land a solid blow when you can't stand up straight. I take a few swings and land a punch, but then I realize I had forgotten that this guy was packing, and he pulls out the same gun that offed my barrel buddy and plants some rounds into my chest.

I wake up in the hospital and manage to escape. Looks like I am going to have to track down this guy the old fashioned way. I go back to the crime scene and collect prints  and a wallet from the victim. Guy's name is Carlos Somethingoranother. I investigate his apartment and his place of work, but I am not finding anything linking him to trench coat dude. I find another lead which is the name of his landlord. Maybe she has a thing for guys in trench coats. I get to her apartment and try to pick the lock when no one is looking. An alarm goes off and I am trapped inside a hallway with a turret that shreds me like mozzarella cheese.

1241,137259767,506480,"A very slow classic style open world RPG, the game creates a random world with it's history and everything. A very ambitious game with good ideas.

Things i like:
- Random generated open world.

- Enemy in combat looks nice and feels alive. They are well animated and some can talk during fights.

- Dungeons, you must actually look around the room/location in a dungeon to find loot (Highly miss-able if you did't look through everything).

- Relationship, i'm pleasantly surprised to see 1 of my 3 school mates in one of the town 
  selling stuff at the market (School mates appears only in dialog during character creations). 

Things i feel can improve:
- A lot of QOL things definitely can do better, unless they purposely left it out just so the game 
  can really feel old school. For example to equip, you have to open character and inventory 
  individually and drag whatever you wanted to equip to your doll (no 1 click to snap in place).

- Combat feels slow, every enemy moves have tiny pauses in between. When vs multiple 
  enemy can be annoying.

- Error log keeps popping out, makes you wonder whether to continue the game or just 
  restart or quit for good.

That's about it for now, hard to progress with so many bugs around. I have restarted the games multiple times and keep getting game breaking bugs, quest giver error, and can't even read books (which is super important since you need to read in order to learn new spell) how to progress without this?

1258,137260468,2281730,"Pros: 

- Movement + parkour. On KBM you can take full advantage of this and it's very fluid. Changing direction midair is a breeze. The game becomes a spiderman simulator where you are no longer limited by silly things like walls or the tops of the map. 

- Guns are perfectly accurate from the hip for the first few bullets while sliding. Crouch spamming alone is not enough to take full advantage of this. Make sure to jump from side to side for near immortality.

- Full crossplay! With mobile devices. No way to turn this off, no where for mobile to run. Very fun experience on PC. Unknown if it's fun on mobile, I can't communicate with my team in game to ask. 

- No ads! Except for the ones asking you to buy one of the many, many things for sale in this game. You can buy extra weapon xp, level xp, and battle pass xp individually for an extra fun 30 mins.

- No Pay to Win! The one tiny thing that's not mentioned is that you can pay to unlock a weapon early that has attachments perhaps equal to a max level weapon. It's not pay to win, just pay to get to the top of what's achievable much faster and flashier. 

- Near-Instant Matchmaking! You will never struggle to find a match quickly. Maybe I'm getting paranoid but it does seem like some lobbies may have accounts that look real but are bots. Some emblems are unlocked by level and some of these accounts have emblems at a level that is way too early. 

- Customize your weapon! Or rather modify its performance through attachments. There is a massive difference between a Level 1 weapon vs a Level 10 weapon vs Max Level 80 Weapons. For extra distinct equality though you can of course buy a $5.99 USD crate with tons of weapons that have incredible attachments.  

- Insane FPS. Getting 240 on ultra settings. Every frame counts in establishing PC dominance vs PC, Mobile, and perhaps Bots. 

Cons:

- Literally None! What more could you ask for from a free game!

1279,137261586,2207490,"Factory Town Idle is actually Factory Town but without the town building on map. Now, everything you build are numbers, and  you don't have to plan your town on a map.

The game went trough a lot of changes before it was launched on Steam, to purchase. The dev had a lot of ideas and went exploring various ways to evolve your map and interaction with other towns. Current version, at the time of this review, I think it's more balanced, since it will force you to build other towns also since you need to trade specific goods available only on those towns.

I see that there are a lot of negative reviews that the game is not Idle, from my point of view, this game is better than idle, you interact with the game a little bit more, you have more micro management to make sure that when the game is idle you can advance, and at the end, while you are away, you can gain resources that you will use when you return to the game.

I recommend games developed by Erik, if you like the genres that he is developing, because he is a very passionate developer and is doing a hard work, FAST WORK and very good interaction with the community. 
You can see more changes between two versions of a game, released in 1-2 days interval, that have more content than other developers deliver in half a year.

Please note that I was not paid for reviewing this game, I received a key because I owned the Factory Town game, and because I was willing to take part in the testing process before the game was released to public.
If you like this kind of game, you should buy it!

There are problems with bugs and the english translation isn't perfect (""Daughter, what's up?"" to 5 year old daughter xD ) but the developers of the game are active right now, trying to iron out all the problems, and even have proposed bug fixes of their own to avoid certain bugs until they can officially iron them out in an update. I think that's awesome, especially considering usually developers just dip on their games, and only come back when the initial sales dip due to the problems. These guys just released the game, are selling massive numbers, and they are still committed to ensuring the game is perfect for everyone. I really like that dedication to their art :)

I'm sure people would expect this review to lose points for bugs and the awkward english, but it's $10 USD, that's not a high price to pay at all for all the sweet and beautiful content you get here.

Combat Master has the potential to be cleaned up and turned into a really fun and accessible FPS, but that's kinda the issue with it: there's such a stark lack of polish everywhere, it's hard to feel like the time you'd put into it is worth it.

A non-exhaustive list of some things that feel unpolished:
- the UI: many important buttons are oddly placed or straight up hard to see
- server quality: opponents typically look jittery at best, teleporty at worst
- gun unlocks look ripped right out of modern COD, yet the system as a whole is way less intuitive
- premium (paid) skins adjust gun stats that affect in-game mechanics (did not verify if Pay2Win or paywalling gameplay options, but both scenarios are bad)
- look sensitivity is obscure and clunky: while it's nice that each scope level has its own sens, the simple scale of 0-500 is unhelpful and the scrolls bars are frustrating to try being precise with.
- the game's namesake mode, Combat Master, is horribly unintuitive. I think it's a 6 player BR, but the maps are small to the point where if you don't spawn close to a weapon chest immediately, you're just gonna repeatedly run into the players who did, turning it into ""run away and hope you find a weapon before they find you"".

I could probably go on but I'll leave it at that. Would love to see this game reach its potential, but the amount of development time it'd take to get it there doesn't seem feasible. Is it worth a download? To feel the movement for yourself, maybe; But it'd be best if you went into it with low overall expectations.",0.0

I knew from the jump that the game was going to be good, but I never expected it to be exactly what I needed today. The style and environments were so warm and welcoming, and in combination with the music, each area felt more and more like sinking into your own bed after being away for a few days. The Mushroom Woods really stood out as a beautiful area to explore, but overall the game looks so lovely. The NPCs were very distinct, with each of them featuring their own lovable personalities and ways of interacting with the player through delightfully charming dialogue. You really can’t help but care for the townspeople of Clover, and I was more than delighted to fix up the town every step of the way. I don’t feel like I can put into words how much I enjoyed the mechanics and platforming in this game. The controls are tight, the platforming segments are incredibly clever, and the quality of life details like the quest journal and the cosmetic options really just top off the gameplay experience. 

My absolute favorite thing about indie games is the amount of love you can feel from the creators, and it is ten times as present in Re:Fresh. Everywhere you look, you can see the immense care the devs took in making this project what it is. The game comes off as deceptively simple but as soon as the credits roll, it is abundantly clear how much hard work, dedication, and heart went into Re:Fresh. The swell of achievement from bringing back hope to Clover, and the warm wash of unadulterated joy at seeing how this game came to be, culminates into a perfect little bow to put on top of this beautiful experience. I am beyond proud of what everyone involved with Re:Fresh has done to make it as delightful as it is, and I can’t wait to see what the future has in store for all of these lovely people.

1312,91488090,1299330,"At this point, I cannot offer this game a positive rating despite my liking to it. Hopefully, this will change.

Simply put, the naval combat in the game is extremely unrealistic. 

During the Civil War, ironclad vessels were the king of the era because very few naval guns could defeat their armor. Ironclad warships were oftentimes scoring a ten to one kill ratio, while battle between ironclads could drag on for hours while remaining inconclusive.

In the game, however, everything is based on RNG, no realistic consideration of gun penetration or armor whatsoever. A small paddle gunboat could one-shot your ironclad warship through some kind of ""catastrophic explosion"" just because RNG says so.

During the Civil War, naval guns were also horrendously inaccurate at anything beyond point-blank range. It usually takes several broadsides to score a lucky hit on a faraway opponent, and even close range gunfire requires multiple ranging shots to be zeroed in.

In the game, however, gunfire at extreme range almost possesses 100% accuracy. This preposterous game feature ruined my immersion completely.

More so, the ""ramming"" attack that tends to sink wooden ships in a single strike does pathetic damage! Making the monstrous ram type ironclad almost ineffective.

Additionally, the game slowly descends into a non-functional state the further one plays into a campaign. On 1862 of the Confederate Campaign, loading a save is almost impossible. One would almost always have to quit out of the game in order to load an old save. What's more? I've been stuck on the screen where my blockade runner reaches Europe for many times now.

As an enthusiastic Civil War naval fan, I've read articles regarding almost every single Civil War maritime engagement and performed in-depth research regarding Civil War naval guns and ironclads. I chose to purchase this game because it is the only large scale Civil War naval game on Steam so far. Yet, the result is wholeheartedly disappointing.

I could forgive the bugs. By all means, I've played so many buggy yet promising games in Early Access state before.

Yet, I cannot recommend Victory at Sea Ironclad because of the horrendously unrealistic, RNG based combat model.

1319,137262674,1701520," If you played the demo, you probably mostly know how you'll feel about the game. It's very colorful and you find weapons of different types as you explore. You start with just a sword, but also find great swords, scythes, whips, and at least one other type of sword. There's a ton of space and the level design isn't extremely memorable, but it's memorable enough for you to recognize certain spots. The map also lets you place up to 200 reminders with various icons, which is nice.

Combat feels pretty good to me, as it's similar to a lot of classic games in the subgenre. You can have two weapons equipped at once and most weapon hits will keep the majority of enemies from attacking. You can dash forward or backward, which I think works quite well, but you don't get I-frames, so don't be expect to constantly dash through enemy attacks. A lot of enemy projectile attacks can be knocked back to enemies and you can equip a tome to use elemental magic spells. Weapons can be improved with a consumable you'll find on occasion, but you absolutely won't want to use these all the time, as you consistently find better weapons. 

Afterimage is an action-RPG, of course, and the main character, Renee, levels up upon accruing sufficient experience, which grants you talent points that can be spent on a skill tree. You'll also find talent points whilst exploring. These will give your stats a buff, as well as teach you new abilities for specific weapons. I'm fairly satisfied with all of this. The exploration is similar, as I really feel like the game does a fantastic job of incentivizing you to look in every nook and cranny, as there's a lot of great stuff to find. You'll naturally also be able to backtrack and find new stuff with your movement abilities.

Now for the stuff I'm not crazy about. When you die, you lose all of the experience you have on you since the last time you level up. This obviously isn't a giant deal and you'll get it all back by touching it at the spot you perished. Afterimage also makes use of a bonfire equivalent, so you'll respawn at these, as well as heal. Resting will bring back any defeated enemies and refill your healing charges too. The game isn't all that difficult, though, and there's no stamina management or anything of that sort, although your MP will recover over time. The bonfire equivalents are quite far from one another, though. The map also doesn't fill in automatically, and it only fills in the places you've been upon using a bonfire equivalent, which I don't mind so much.

As for another thing I don't care for, you can only fast travel by using a consumable (at least, so far). This obviously puts a major damper on going back and exploring, but these consumable might be easy to come by later. Early on, I only found a single one of these, so don't expect to find them all the time in your first few hours. Overall, I'm enjoying the game and it offers most of what I like to see in a Metroidvania. It also appears to be fairly lengthy.",1.0

Now lets get into the cool stuff that you will love alot right away.

1. Controller support off the getgo... able to be played on Steam Link... on my Phone.
2. Carts... Yes carry all your items with you and don't think your in The Forest... wait wrong game... either way we got 2 of them so far.
3. Ships... yes full on exploration using ships... when you get it... its very fun to just drive around.
4. The game's early hard mode, goes away once you get to know what your doing... the difficulty was hard sure... but it was good... later updates might need to add more difficult enemies on newer islands... but for now its fine.
5. Stone,Flint,Obisidian... plans for Copper,Iron... what? you want cool stuff. go get the resources... the wait is worth it when you finally get a obisidian spear and can kill all those annoying pesky uhh squirrls? waht are they again... to busy murdering these things.
6. Foundation base building similar to ARK,Forest, and alot of other games... at least its windows are interactable.
7. A Dock Piece... yes a Dock Buildable piece... why do games just not have any Prefabs nowadays? this prefab is one of my fav looking.
8. I Love the story.
9. I've never CTD Or Hard Crash, besides Lag Spikes here and there... game is running perfectly fine.
10. Im running out of ideas... i'll edit later and add more stuff.

The Bad.

1. FPS Drops here and there, nothing major... you won't notice it.... mostly when loading alot of stuff in... which you will be fine dealin with.
2. The Lack of more content... now this isn't a major thing... its just i want more. and its coming, so don't let that get you down.
3. The Walking/Movement... now it seems slow sure... but this was probably to slow the early game down... which is fine, but we need a faster movement later game.
4. Doesn't seem to be any Stone Building/Brick/Clay building, could be a future update.
5. Tools break fast... idk if its me... or i'm just using them to much.
6. Figuring out Hides... is a nightmare... and needs improved... abit more... the Jackel hide as far as i can tell does nothing... the only way to get hides is from Boar.
6. It rains to much... idk this just annoys me personally it constantly is rainning... but it is the tropics... i just wish it was less.
7. Custom settings... for resource respawns... world day/night cycle... monster amount counts... stuff like this is missing and should be a feature later on... for Custom Difficulty.
8. 2 Boats... at the time of writing this and playing it... I Was hoping more. then again still early access.
9. Mapping is kindof weird... since i can't auto map while walking? like i've seen this area... just map it already? do it in a more smaller reveal area... if you want it that way... but when the map says NOTHING SEEn... i'm confused.... since i remember the area... explorers would just remember the stuff... not map everything... most of the time... ish.
10. nothing really else... i can pull out of my head... game is fine, it just needs more updates.

Overall worth the money, good devs, needs more content, fun to screw around with.",1.0
1323,137263342,2089500,"So far been enjoying this game immensely.

It has built a very charming and sweet world that is very easily to fall in love with. The art style is very pretty and feels magical, the soundtrack is incredible, 100% worth getting as well if you enjoy the style or genre for listening to even when not playing. 

The game play is familiar, but unique. I can see some people finding it a tad awkward or uncomfortable at first coming from other games with similar mechanics (slay the spire etc), however once it clicks (and it will) you will find it flows incredibly well for a slightly faster paced card battler. Learning to be knowledgeable with your deck and how to best use your hand within and being able to make that decision quickly is incredibly satisfying. If you are finding it a tad weird, just push through a little more until it clicks, I promise its worth it.

What am I talking about? First, bots either can't hit you at arm's length, or they kill you with a shotgun at a distance of hundreds of meters. Maybe I haven't learned how to play yet, but I would like to understand if this is a feature, or if it needs to be fixed. I'm also very tired of logistics. If you have more than three factories, then your head starts to hurt after about 40 minutes of the game, because you need to keep in mind where how much and what is missing. Otherwise, the gameplay is more than pleasant, and even such a complex logistics is quite interesting at first, but it gets very tiring over time. Well, something else is wrong with the optimization in the game, sometimes the FPS can drop to 30-40, although it is stable 70",1.0

The gameplay is where this really shines, incredibly deep detective simulation where everything can play a role in the crime scene: 
Is there fingerprints on that toothpaste?
What size shoes did the victim wear? Do they match up with those boot prints?
Where does their spouse work? Whats their working hours? Perhaps I should drop by.
Whats the last telephone call they sent/received? Maybe i'll trace it

1336,137264968,986130,"Rough around the edges (hence the early access) but so damn fun. There's just no other game out there like this that lets you be an investigator in such a dynamic and free way. The game combines so many dynamic systems together to create a detailed playground of hundreds of citizens leaving paper trails for you to follow, every one of which you can dig deeper into by breaking into their home, or work, to learn more about them.

Murders happen dynamically while you play, meaning you can accidentally find yourself at the scene of the crime as it happens. Or not. However, the many ways that you can approach the discovery of the murderer is insane no matter when you arrive. 

I found myself at the scene of a crime yesterday that happened on the streets. After gathering information on the body I was able to instinctively look around the scene for a security camera. After a little breaking in I was able to view the footage during the time frame the murder happened, which lead me to a visual description of about 5 people. To narrow it down, I asked people around that area of the city if they seen anything, and I was on my path to solve the murder, and it worked.

Music and art are well thought out and executed, there is a coherence between the two which is nice to see from a small indie title like this. Overall this game could be a little bit of a hidden gem, I hope more people find it!

1342,137266113,1234180,"i got this game because i saw it circulating on twitter and i thought the art style looked really neat.

what i like:
the game looks great, feels good to play with controller, i enjoy being able to toggle visual effects such as blur and chromatic abberation, the enemies are simple but memorable in their design, weirdly shaped guys. i particularly like how are all the vehicles are rendered; all the shadows when turning and stuff are gorgeous.

now..... onto what's making me unable to finish it.
often times i feel like enemies are too powerful, or there's too many. this isn't that bad with the green guys and their generators, because you can just walk ahead, get rid of those and get the darsanauts to safety - it isn't as easy, and not nearly as fun, to fend off the several spaceship-steering green guys, the bats or the diggers.
next, the decision to limit your jetpack use in level 17, where it's  a bit inconveniencing, and in 27, where i've stopped now. this just isn't fun for me, when being able to fly around for a while is already a thing you were able to do previously, as well as reusing it in level 27, where there is so much verticality you could explore alot faster with the regular jetpack.
one more thing i personally dislike is the way the cursor is bound to the camera and movement of the player when using mouse and keyboard (not the recommended controls, but still). adding to that, the crosshair is REALLY hard to see.

i started out really enjoying this game, it was laid back and pretty alright difficulty wise - even the little remarks the characters make about the game being hard but the player just needing to get better were silly and fun. but as it went on it just made me more and more frustrated. it's really a shame, because i can tell alot of love and effort went into moons of darsalon, and i really wanted to play it all the way through. despite all that, major respect for the solo developer crafting this game througout the years!! i hope other people have more fun with this than me.",1.0

As a barista, players get to brew warm drinks using a variety of ingredients such as tea, ginger, mint, chocolate, and coffee, among others. By experimenting with different combinations of ingredients, players can uncover secret recipes that can change people's lives by serving drinks that warm their hearts. Each drink is unique and tailored to the individual customer's needs, and as such, players must listen carefully to the stories their customers share to create the perfect drink.

One of the game's most striking features is its latte-art simulation, which allows players to draw their own latte-art masterpiece to decorate their drinks. With a simple-to-use interface, players can create unique and stunning designs that are sure to impress even the most discerning customer.

The game's chill lo-fi atmosphere is perfect for relaxing and unwinding after a long day. Players can immerse themselves in the relaxing coffee shop atmosphere, listening to the rain outside, and playing chillhop beats while engaging in coffee talk with their customers.

The diverse cast of characters is another highlight of the game. Players get to meet quirky and interesting characters such as Baileys the elf freelance graphic designer, Lua the succubus bisdev executive, Myrtle the orc game developer, and many more. Each character has their own story to tell, and players can influence them with a warm drink or two, helping them overcome their fears and challenges.

The game has successfully brought a new mechanic to the tower defense world and attracted puzzle enthusiasts to its audience. I also liked that there are both rewards and penalties for digging, which balances the game well. Sometimes, the newly opened enemy spawn points challenge me, but they also made me think more strategically and step outside of my classic tower defense tactics.

There's so many things I'd do differently IRL, but I'm bound to the game's rules and I don't know how to proceed. Pretty much all AI say the same things like ""it's none of your business"" and ""I'm not gonna tell you that"".

They MASSIVELY dropped the ball on the endings though. 
If steam had a good rating system that alone would make me drop this from a 9/10 to a 6/10.

At the end you need to chose from one of  5 categories without knowing whats in them without being able to go back after picking one and then you are presented with a bunch of random text that doesn't really correlate with the respective job.
Now that already sounds annoying but the best part about it is that you don't actually get to choose at all!
Every random text blurb has like 5 different jobs associated with it and which one you get is determined by EIGHTEEN different skills/numbers. 
Have too much of one skill? Tough luck you are locked out of that ending forever.

Going 100% without a guide would take easily hundreds of hours that's like asking a blind man to sort marbles by color you are just stumbling through the dark.

I was ready to do a few runs for all the endings but with this system it would just be me micromanaging 18 numbers comparing it with the guide spreadsheet and spamming through the entire games dialogue (no skip function) just so I can get the ""Slightly worse knight than the other ending""-ending.

I have no idea why they went out of their way to make the ending system a black box full of knifes this is actively malicious in how bad it is.
PLEASE JUST GIVE ME A LIST OF ALL THE JOBS AVAILABLE

For example I took a job to arrest a person and the only information I got was a phone number, age, eye color and height of the person, calling the number the person answered with their first name but refused to answer any further questions so I looked through the phonebook and got all the addresses of people with the same first name initial. 

Then I started going to the addresses and knocking on their doors until in the fourth apartment I found a person who had the matching eye color, I had to bribe him so he let me inside his home where I found his drivers licence which confirmed that the name and age matched so I arrested him and got my reward money.",1.0

1384,137268676,986130,">Early Access Review as of 04/2023

Compared to other games with procedurally generated elements where pieces of the world fit together like a child's 12 piece jigsaw puzzle, Shadows of Doubt is a technical marvel. 

Despite performance hiccups when moving indoors/outdoors it manages to balance a ton of moving pieces at once like NPC information, their schedules, relationships all while you run across town, through buildings and up and down elevators without a single loading screen.

Gameplay wise it's very satisfying tying together threads and uncovering these randomly generated mysteries. There are commonalities however and while everyone has a unique and fun story to tell right now I think it'll be two months before they all begin to sound alike.

While you can follow many different interesting threads like tracing phone calls, finger print scanning, checking security tapes etc. 
All leads however boil down into breaking into a place which hasn't been balanced because of the random nature of it. And to break into a place it will only ever follow 3 paths: 1. Bribe your way in 2. Go in through the vents 3. Disable security and lockpick in, with your limited items and gadgets only helping to slightly even the odds but it isn't enough. 

The dialogue tree isn't versatile enough to feel natural. Speaking to NPCs feels like talking to Morrowind NPCs who have no quests attached to them. They can tell you who they are, who they knows, where places are but not anything of substance or relevance.

The combat system is incredibly janky and nonfunctional. You can only temporarily stun and render opponents asleep for 2 mins or surprise and cuff them from behind although this approach might bug the game with an unending 'Pursuit' of you.
Guns feature in the game but you cannot use them and supposedly they won't ever be able to be used because killing NPCs would break the procedurally generated elements. 

You will be discovered, you will die, you will save scum, you'll find out the place you spent hours trying to get into wasn't actually related to the case at all. 
Only in the tutorial mission will you ever be handed the closest thing the game has to a smoking gun. These cases are incredibly difficult.

Side missions trick you into thinking that a case to find a missing necklace is an easy beginner's case but instead you'll be handed only a fingerprint and an address book with 14+ people in it to sort through. 
A mission like this can take hours and end up being a total waste of money, effort and time.
Other missions simply say: Arrest this office worker, we don't know where he works, who he is, how old he is, what he looks like, no evidence, just go get him. 
Side missions seem to be a complete afterthought, not as fleshed out as the murder cases yet, not worth the time or effort as of now. 

Hours of progress can easily be lost and doomspiral until you're out of money, lockpick resources and wanted for more crimes than the criminal you're hunting.

The game desperately needs more player options for circumventing annoying stonewalls like uncooperative suspects and triple layered security systems for a janitor's broom closet. 

Alternate sneaking methods of entry like getting through windows, leveraging police warrants to get into suspect's homes, being able to use limited screwdrivers to disable security cameras from below.

Right now it only barely succeeds as a detective sim and you'll note other reviews of people who simply gave up on the snooping and now treat the game as a Hobo Looting Simulator. 
I'm hoping the devs can patch a few more features into this to fully deliver on the premise.

1385,137268206,986130,"Good game even in its current state. It’s like a procedurally generated noir/private detective story that plays kinda like Deus Ex or Thief with a decent amount of BladeRunner‘s bleak vibe. The graphics aren’t amazing but the post processing is used to good effect.

Interacting with the environment is really immersive. Like if you open a drawer you don’t get a pop up window to show you what’s in there, the draw itself opens up and whatever’s in the drawer is actually in the drawer.

Had heaps of fun solving the first “tutorial” murder, and one procedural one after that.
There are side jobs you can take, I need to take a photo of someone and all I know about them is they have green eyes, their partner’s first name (Ying), and their partner’s profession. So I gotta go visiting all the “Y.”s in the phone book.
It gives you difficult tasks and you have to figure out how to achieve them using what’s available to you in game. It’s nice that it doesn’t help you out too much.

You can buy an apartment and furnish it which is kind of cool, I wasn’t really expecting that from this game but it’s a nice distraction from cases. Not sure if you can own multiple apartments at once. Dev please add being a landlord.

Only issue is maybe performance, it runs decently on my laptop at 1080p and mid-high settings but it’s a decent laptop. 40-60 fps with frames capped at 60. Even at 40 it’s very playable because it’s a fairly slow paced game most of the time.
Laptop specs:
RTX 3050 4GB
Ryzen7 6800H 
16GB DDR5 

I’m impressed it performs as decently as it does because of just how much stuff is being simulated. Like all 300 citizens have jobs and go out for meals and drinks and stuff. And while they’re doing that, every security camera is actually watching for people and taking photos of them, that you can break into the security computer and look at, and print them out to add to your cork board.

So yeah just be warned that it might not run on your busted-ass hoopty laptop from 2018 but it’s a fun and unique game",1.0

The game has some cutscenes with just enough amount of dialogue and do note that because this is a low-budget game voice acting is missing, however, the music is quite good. 

It's one of those games where levels consist of various rooms / scenes and we switch between them. We can click on highlighted objects and use the items in our inventory (or combine them).

1392,137270787,1608640,"""OXTO"" is an intense, adrenaline-fueled, twin-stick-shooter-roguelike with similar graphics and gameplay as ""Hotline Miami"", but with its own gorgeous style and the addition of bullet-time, dodgeroll and (a much needed) health bar.

The visuals are viscerally noir, the soundtrack slaps you in the face just right, the story and lore of the mysterious entity manifesting as the mansion and the Sisyphus-like task at hand (which is a meta-comment for the genre) is told well and with a grain of existential dread.

Unfortunately, the first area of the game can get old when you already did various runs and then it is very hard to die to the first boss, which seems a bit of a chore. Also some of the drinks (skills) seem superior to others, but these two complaints are just a minor setback.

Many of the flaws from this game comes from the lack of content, from leveling up you can literally pick every skill available in the level up selection. Monster, boss and meta progression are also very limited. When you start progressing towards the higher difficulty, the game is not very optimized and I've had a fair bit of frame drops mainly because my character was firing way too many shots per second and had way too many books shooting on screen as well.

There's a ton of promise here, but the game is currently pretty unstable - i've been experiencing frequent crashes to the point i haven't actually been able to make much progress in a case. I've noticed some general performance hitches, but being on a 3090 they're not too noticable. 

There are also some pretty major blind spots in the game right now that force you to take a hardline extra-legal approach. You can't just *ask* to see the security footage, you need to bribe them for the codes or break in. You can't just *ask* for access to an apartment from say, a building manager or the cops, you have to break in. There doesn't appear to be any way to say, befriend citizens so they're more friendly toward you, willing to give you tips etc, staples of the detective genre. Obviously these would be fairly complex systems to implement, and the game is still in early access, but their absence is very loud.

This is probably just be a skill issue, but I found the case-board RAPIDLY got out of control with the amount of evidence I felt I needed to keep tracked.

First i want to get the negatives out of the way, [b] to the developers hopefully you read this!!!! [/b]

I suspect these are already getting worked on. But i would still like to state it, so if you decide to get the game you can know what to expect as of April 25, 2023. (WILL UPDATED when a dew updates release.) 

Performance: Needs to be improved, that said i haven't had too much of an issue, i have a i7 7700k and 1080ti and it runs quite smoothly at 1440p. However it does stutter sometimes. Load times can be a little long, but surprisingly not as bad as i thought they were going to be on a very large world.

AI: I would love to see the AI react to the environment and player in a more realistic manor. Just a quick example; If you shut off someones PC while their on it they will get upset at you. If you throw something at someone have a brawl but people whipping out pistols to cap you is a bit too common LOL. 

More Variety of Missions (although there is still a decent amount of missions for the game just releasing).

More Detailed information on people. Example, instead of just saying Height: ""Tall"" Maybe give a specific height for better immersion...

[b]POSITIVE:[/b]

[b]Procedural:[/b] This is the big one and will help with longevity of this game. Missions are procedural, maps, people. As far as i can tell you can literally go into EVERY building, every room. People actually live in those buildings, work, visit people. In that regard it feels like a living simulation. Not sure if everything is dynamic or if the investigation starts once you accept the mission however, murders seem to be dynamic. They can happen randomly. Which is awesome.

Detailed investigation: Find fingerprints, links to people, witnesses, read emails, watch CCTV footage and more to figure out who the suspect is. 
Since everything is procedural no two cities, cases, people are the same. 

Graphics: Really love the graphics, the lighting is quite spectacular IMO.

[b]This game has a long way to go for sure, but as long as the devs stick with it and keep working with the community to see what they would like this will shape up to easily be the best detective game on the market. 
Even in its current state, i'd say this is still one of the best detective games ever made.[/b]

First Impressions
-----------

Put on a trenchcoat and solve [strike]conspiracies[/strike] murders.  This game has a heavy deus ex cyberpunk vibe while being set in a fictional 1979*.  There are no unusable doors here, every building in this small-but-tall city is fully explorable, filled with citizens going about their daily lives, including working, dining, robbing and murdering the other citizens.  NPCs actually have to interact with things to get them to work, which can aid in your investigation - you can sometimes access a terminal that has been carelessly left logged in (or a door unlocked) by the employees when they leave.  Alternatively, the NPCs are sometimes careless enough to leave the post-it-notes near the safe/pc or a spare key under the doormat.  Make connections between murderer and murdered with one of those woollen-strings conspiracy boards, included with heaps of colours for your convenience.  You also don't have to talk to them, NPCs can be identified via voice, ID, location in the phone book, credentials on their work/home PCs, or even via breaking into the phone controller in the basement and checking the call logs.

Storytime, based on the tutorial mission:
-----------

I had a note to go find Onni Jonnson slipped under my door.  After looking up onni in the yellow pages, I tracked their address down to 802/Rose building, just down the road from my apartment.  Investigating the apartment, no one was answering despite the TV being on.  I gained entry via a key found under the doormat and found poor Onni crumpled under the desk in their bedroom.  exploration of the apartment found multiple VHS tapes, cigars, matchbooks from every casino in the country and several sets of fingerprints belonging to Onni and an as yet unknown person (marked as B on the conspiracy board).  I also found that Onni worked as a manager at Goldbourne Technologies.  Being the tutorial, the cops decided to bust in but were slowed because I was smart enough to have locked the door behind me in case this happened.  After taking the John McLane exit (not the last I'd be doing in this investigation) I made my way to Goldbourne, however it was outside of working hours and the security was on.  Luckily for me, the security guard had buggered off for the night and left their terminal unlocked, so I was able to turn the security cameras off and move around in the office more easily.  And by 'off' I mean 'shoot everyone going up and down the stairs' so the air was quickly filled with bullets and unconscious NPCs before I could turn them off.  
After [strike]inspecting the victims' wallets for information and free cash[/strike] making sure they were ok, I decided to leave and come back a few minutes later.  I ended up again crawling through vents, and Onni's desk was nice enough to be out of line of sight of the cameras.  In his emails I found references to a Penny Tyus, who appeared to be the supplier of the original note, and Violet Diaz, who was an associate of Onni's and worked at an illegal store in a local basement. Having also looted the security guard's safe and found a loose diamond inside, I promptly fell down the elevator shaft (who opened all the doors on the way down?  definitely wasn't me) and woke up in hospital, short of my loot.  Again, this was after-hours so the staff were all off-site and I could rob the place for meds and cash.  
To find Violet, I went to the underground store mentioned in the emails.  I had a passphrase but I [strike]misclicked[/strike] decided to barge in anyway, and found a set of ballistic armour before having to hide in the toilet from staff.  This did not go as planned because the staff wanted to use the toilet, however I was able to escape with the help of a truncheon I had bought using everyone else's money.  I decided to go to her home after looking her up in the phonebook, and after breaking my leg crawling through vents I got into the apartment of violet.  It turned out her husband worked at city hall, however my first priority was finding a splint to heal with.  This was interrupted as one of the homeowners was in the bathroom and interrupted my escape, again the truncheon saved my life and I was able to handcuff one of the occupants.  Within the room, I was able to find the murder weapon, and after applying some wooden anasthetic to Violet I was able to get hold of her fingerprints and link her back to the scene of the crime, as well as leaving her momentoes of her and her partner's cuffed, unconscious bodies using their own polaroid camera.  

I took the pistol as a memento and put it in my safe, along with an augmentation booster and a VHS both from Onni's apartment.  [b]A job well done for the City of Darkness PD[/b]",1.0

I will say at max resolution (same rezzy other games run at on this display), it was choppy and ran like crap. Turned down the resolution just a bit, and it ran really smooth. That last statement isn't a critique, but rather a warning - there's a lot of of processing going on in the background for a game like this, so forgive a little stutter here and there and adjust your game/machine/display settings accordingly :)

Two things they did right:  Creating the ability to get down on ground level and watch your survivors walk about in an environment that lives and breathes.  Creating a game where you will spend hours without being bored.

One thing they did wrong:  The controls are difficult to master.  Mouse works better than controller by far, and you would be well advised to set the scale bar for the ability to 'turn' to full.

One annoying point, every playthrough the female characters all seem to like each other romantically and hate the men, the men all seem to like each other and hate the women... it's just not realistic. I get that you feel compelled to be ""inclusive"" these days, but your gay ratio is way the F off and it feels forced.

1457,130901855,1324130,"I was on the fence, then looked up what previous games the dev did. This helped push me off the fence.

Stranded has come across as a well polished and stable experience. I have yet to get any survivors off the planet and still figuring out things. Only recently, I found that you can prioritise a specific task by selecting a survivor and then right clicking on the task.

Could do with more upgrades to help crafting items faster, and perhaps an upper and lower limit for producing items (start production when below this limit, stop production when above this limit) which I would find really helpful with cooking.

It does miss an ability to prioritise clearing out shelves/containers before deconstructing. Deconstruction is red so cannot prioritise until its empty (clicking keep this shelf empty helps at times but its not a solution). My survivors just seem to ignore the shelves and deal with over handling tasks instead.

Sending survivors off on expeditions and finding seasonal clothing set sounds great until they just return with a single item of clothes like a top. Rewards from expeditions just do not feel like they justify the cost of fuel for the journey.

I would like a way for switch to also be powered by a day/night sensor. Seems it will act as an override to the sensor and power will just stay on as per configuration of the switch itself alone.",1.0
1458,126954217,1324130,"I LOVE the game, i still recommend it, but here are some of the things that i consider need some tweaking. (150+ hours game play)

- Enemies should not just ""spawn"" out of existence, they should be somewhere in the map and move towards your base at random intervals. They should not spawn right next to your buildings, that defeats the purpose of placing walls to make a perimeter because most of the time they just spawn right inside your perimeter.

- Hauling system is awful, with pawns constantly going for the item furthest away from the one they just picked up. They also prioritize meats over leather and you realize they didn't pick them up after you see the leather rooting away...  Specially when items are hard to see with plain eye unless you zoom in to almost touching the ground. This make micro-managing way worst.

- Gear and weapon do degrade at a stupid speed that is not compared to Real-life. Gear should only degrade based on if you take damage (for gear) or do damage (for weapons)

- All events seems to be on a clock schedule, every play-through feels the same and you can basically tell when an event will happen.

1472,124745731,1324130,"  So I have put about 150 hours into this game since it released onto early access.  For an early access game I found it surprisingly well fleshed out.  It is early access and I look forward to seeing where this goes. Currently you kind of get the same old grind of things after a bit. Not Much Story even among the character interactions which is an area I hope that they develop.  I Do think that this is intended in order to create a lot more interesting goings about and add some variety to it on playthrough. It has a lot of potential and is enjoyable in its current state. 

The Things I did find after 150 hours is that this game for me gets a bit too repetitive and it is my sincere hope that the developers finished product will have extensive modding support and more depth to its characters and social interactions among a few other things. If the mission is to survive I did not find this much of a challenge and would like to see a bit more attention paid to the logistics of managing the survivors.  I Spent the majority of the game on the highest fast forward setting and easily overcame the few pickles i found myself in managing my survivors.  Its worth buying and supporting the devs and i sincerely hope they put up a roadmap.",1.0
1473,124738873,1324130,"This game has a LOT of potential. It plays smooth, yet is a bit quirky in some aspects.

- The survivors have no auto reaction to being attacked
- Research seems to be a really low priority, especially compared to observation of plants/animals
- The slow research stifles the game progress

I see this game getting a lot of play time for me in the future, but I hope these issues and a few of the other quirks are taken care of.

EDIT:

Still enjoying the game, some additional thoughts.

- The Tutorials are long, but def worth watching
- You HAVE to pay attention to the survivors and their abilities. Started one planet, had  2 out of 4 with NO skill in weapons. It went poorly. You can pick your crew, I didn't and paid a terrible price.
- Observe EVERYTHING, plants, animals, rocks, whatever you can observe, observe.

1475,124732844,1324130,"Very sly game. Seems a easy game at first. But it's very-very difficult and time consuming.
I like the game, art style and all. But you need tremenous ammount of patience. And need to constantly adjust your strategy. And have a lot of flexibility and patience to see the people do the jobs you allocate.
There are many tricks and now-hows, you need to be aware to be able to survive. And many things are not obvious. Like some things you need rather scavenge or get from expeditions, instead of crafting. Or hidden research, that unlock life saving (much faster crafting speed) techs, you can unlock only by expeditions.

The game is very sticktly balanced, so you have very little wiggle room. Much less creative freedom you have, compared to Rimworld, etc. You need to play, as devs intened it to be played. Otherwise, you will bleed out on the grand scale.


Post note: what I liked in the game, which is very unique: the maps are hand crafted, as I understand. (If you use the ""built-in"" seeds.) And it felt so. Or maybe I was lucky with my seed. And the playable characters are few and feel real. Thus, I felt that my map and the gameplay with the charecters was unique. (I landed in a rocky are, on the top of a mountain. So the soil was not very good for growing. But had a lot of stone. And lot of natural cover by big rocks. I also didn't choose characters, just let the default randomized choose people - as would be in real life. You don't choose your travel companion in a public travel.)",1.0

1499,137272710,1679290,"I need to praise the effort put into the art direction, which is remarkably consistent, and of high quality. The irony in some of the depictions of nations and historical characters sometimes is rather unfunny (to me).

As a war game this is a complete non-event. It is a strategy game with a very well-defined theme and very shallow but finicky battle mechanics. The rules of Kriegspiel are simple, yet deep - and it is a 200 year old game system meant to simulate this very era. Why just don't implement it and put a coat of 21st century snazzy graphics on top of it? There is no tactical nuance: you move to contact, fire, wait for the AI to charge... and that's it. 

The map is crowded with HUGE icons that are supposed to hover over your units. The problem being that those icons sometimes do not register clicks and most of the time are obscuring the battlefield. They convey a lot of information about your units, but do not allow to analyse the terrain. 

""Historical battles"" are essentially MP matches where each player starts in a corner of the map and has to maneuver to contact. The best thing about the historical battles is the opening paragraph giving brief yet well done historical notes to give some context to the player.

A detailed comparison of Fire & Maneuver with games that actually try to simulate (in similar periods) the subject matter is unfair, and an exercise that I leave for the readers of this review. I think too that it may be the gateway for some to get interested into wargaming. The period depicted is super interesting and kinda exotic. It is just too bad for an old grognard like me that since the release of SSI's Age of Rifles (like 30 years ago) there hasn't been a war game published that struck a good balance between historicity and gameplay covering this period.

The job of a crime scene cleaner is hard and thankless. For some reason, garbage cans are constantly checked, too scrupulous guards for some reason ask why your companion in a wheelchair looks so sick, the authorities do not give bonuses for harmful work. So it remains only to admire the medals for the perfect cleaning, hanging on the wall in the secret room. The crime scene cleaning puzzle game is back and doing it very well. I can't say that the formula for the success of the first game is somehow radically developing, rather, it exploits the potential that has already been developed to the maximum. We have a large number of new cases here, new funny incidents, confusing situations that baffle you, the black humor of the protagonist. All the cases are very witty and crisp, some of them are rather big in scale, the creators do not put pressure on you, but give you the opportunity to explore colorful locations to your heart's content. The game looks delicious, the recognizable visual style of the creators gives its flavor to what is happening. Minor roughness does not spoil the game, but it is impossible not to notice them. For example, in some places you have too many items in your inventory, and you simply don’t know what to do, and the decision turns out to be not the most logical. This is ESPECIALLY about the use of light sticks, which suddenly enter the action almost on a new game mechanic that did not exist until then, and you keep trying to use them directly in dark tunnels. A purely personal reproach is the location of the hint button next to the inventory and the map, an accidental click on which breaks the achievement. In all other respects, the game is just great; it gives such a good charge of vivacity, delighting with black humor and a strange anti-Bond atmosphere. This is exactly what we were waiting for after the release of the first part; the creators did not spoil their child with something unnecessary, competently using the foundation of the first game. Of course I recommend and look forward to new cleanings!",1.0

1509,137273689,1860510,"This game is very fun, but it's difficult to say whether it will become abandonware in a year's time. I wish Steam had a ""Maybe"" button. It's currently very fun, and it would be quite suitable in it's present state, but there are a few important but minor changes I feel need to be made as soon as possible before I can recommend it:

1. (Necessary) Ability to set how powerful/aggressive you want rebels to be. Currently they will somehow out-produce real nations, creating many tanks and armored vehicles in the time it takes you to produce a few. They seem to have unlimited manpower, money, and to spawn whatever ammo and weapons they need. They break my immersion so much I'd just turn them off if I could.

2. (Desired) Map needs to be larger and countries should not all be so close to each other in power. Would also be nice if there was usually more of a buildup to war and ways to prevent it, rather than the enemy just walking over your border without warning of any kind. (Though would be cool if that still happened sometimes as a surprise attack)

3. (Necessary) Tanks should be able to fire shell then swap to machinegun while reloading. The reloading time after firing a shell must pass before you can fire the machinegun. Tanks have loaders so the gunner can keep firing a machinegun while it reloads.

4. (Desired) Vehicle MGs need to be more accurate. Right now it feels like a big floppy salmon that just sort of fires bullets in random directions with a vague bias toward where you're aiming.",0.0

1511,137272328,2181140,"Fun tower defense game, though the initial learning is a bit rough because everything is thrown at you at once, it's ultimately pretty simple. My only complaints are the menu music being at too loud a default volume, and how hard it can be to locate those guys that damage all of your buildings. (I've spent the entire timer looking and still failed to find it, multiple times.)

It could use some real death animations, and more impressive/notable animations in general. As it is, it isn't super impressive, but it is definitely a solid tower defense game and the amount of upgrades and modifiers should keep it interesting in my free time.",1.0
1512,137274560,1289340,"I'm a bit surprised this game is fully released. To me it still feels very bare.  It's a fun little restaurant game but it gets repetitive really fast. What bugs me most is there's very limited possibilities for decoration and furniture. I feel like this selection could've majorly approved upon.

After a while of playing, things get more demanding and start making less sense. It seems I have to keep adding equipment to my kitchen. 3 dishwashers, 4 dishwashers... Cabinets for tableware, multiple coffeemachines and mixers and everything seems to want more. I would've preferred if it would go a bit slower and more relaxing.

Having said all that, I do like the feel of the game. It's very easy to play, it's intuitive and I will probably come back to play more of it. I'm secretly hoping there might be more decoration and options in the future.",1.0

-If you fail the only objective, it throws you out of the game and you have to start over.
-Objective list is in gray/white text usually above the room/walls that are in the same color. Think I played for 2 hours before I noticed there was a direct objective list there on the screen as it blended perfectly.

1520,137273226,1432380,"This is a neat indie FPS with a bit of souls-like mechanics i.e. you can dash out of the harms way (no iframes though) and parry and riposte for a satisfying counter attack. Fast paced melee combat is complemented by a few spells which have weak and strong variant and they can be quite OP if used tactically. 
Dying means getting respawned at the latest checkpoint with full health while the not-already-dead mobs get full health as well and you lose a 1000 score points. This allows for little bit of cheesing, especially first two bosses who don't heal to full HP (my guess is so they are easier to handle early in the game) and I would like to see a bigger penalty for death since currently it removes the stakes unless you constrain yourself of cheesy play. I would also like to see some form of post level screen just to be informed of collected / missed items and enemies.
One big flaw I would like to point out is that there is only one melee weapon at the moment, hope we can get new ones as the game develops further.

Overall it is a fun game for fps / souls fans well worth the price.",1.0
1521,137275585,909320,It takes a while for the game to get going but once you unlock more powers and figure things out it gets really really fun. There's so many things you can do to mess with the characters. The monsters may sometimes get in the way and abduct or kill your targets so I use my spells on them instead lol.,1.0
1522,137274708,909320,"The game still feels incomplete to me. There is no satisfying end goal to pursue beyond *Win* and the game is still to easy. Ultimately playing with the difficulty settings might make the game *Longer* but not *harder*, and will just lead to lots of waiting around. There isn't really any rival force to compete with while you take the time to torment the villagers and gain power, or just kill them off without much struggle. 

Additionally you still cant *Summon your Ruinarch* which is something i have been waiting for since very early in the games lifespan, despite it being talked about quite a bit. If we could potentially summon an avatar of our character it would add meaning to all this gathering dark energy to build a portal stuff instead of it just being a bit of a slog. The amount of control you have over your own cultists and demons is also incredibly insignificant and to be perfectly honest, its probably better to not make a cult at all. It would be cool if there was a possesion ability to directly take over a cultist or something at least. Cults tend to lose the ability to progress since they kick out 95% of the village or start from scratch, and after spending tons of effort forming them they will inevitably die off to something silly offscreen. It can be very hard to keep anyone alive in this since all Villagers seem hellbent on killing themselves one way or another. Your better off just manipulating your pet villager from the shadows and not forming a demon cult faction to bring them under, or they will become fairly useless pretty fast.

Anyway as of now the best way for the game to *fight back* is by ether summoning angels/spirits to attack you when you intervene directly to often (But this always backfires and just makes me far more powerful since i can enslave their angels and make an op army of fallen angels, and they give tons of chaotic energy to fuel my powers. Because of this turning the retaliation to max actually makes the game go a lot quicker and more smoothly) or randomly locking away your powers when someone happens to get the trait that allows them to do so, though this is only really an annoyance that you will probably fix pretty fast after turning them into a pile of gore. It would be nice if the Gods worshipped by your enemies could create a champion that is actually a threat to combat you, make them actually un-corruptable and difficult to knock out (not just blessed since you can easily remove that as was shown with excalibur, which btw i havent seen in centuries. They pretty much never get to even try using the holy sword against you. Not that it would help since they are easy to kidnap by knocking them out with a raiding squad)

Anyway as it stands now, it will probably be fun initially while you learn how to play the game, but lose its luster and become dull after you know how it works. In the end i feel like there is not enough meaning to anything we do, and not enough resistance to make waiting for your inevitable victory actually worth it.

1532,137262564,1324130,"The game is good, pretty good in fact but not great. That being said its ""Early Access"" so expectations still exist.
For starters the game is as others are saying, its a Rimworld type functioning game with a different look and feel.

Cons 
It's the look and feel that both brings it up and brings it down. Being more immersed visually creates the feeling to have a mental and emotional need, this doesn't give that (yet). There is no real story or end game goal and by that I mean the experience is at the moment very short lived, what you get 1 hour into it is what you get the rest of the game so far (speaking of the gameplay itself here). That would be the main con in my opinion but again EA so its to be expected at the moment.

Combat is an area the Devs can really put more work in on future updates as it is well to be frank pretty bad. The Draft system as it is ""should"" be a secondary system for the active combat. To make effective use of turrets you pretty much have to create an uncomfortably large power grid that clutters the space making TD the secondary combat system atm. The taming is indeed involved in the combat however its pretty unreliable simply being an accessory to the draft system. 

Resource and space ""balancing"" are also currently more of a chore than a fun part at the moment (specifically when trying to be organized and optimized), this due to terrain constraints such as empty craters from debris sites that remain once the debris is cleared, which some Terra forming functions being implemented would greatly help while staying (realistic).

Pros
The modding support, there is a lot to get comfortable with and can just as easily make the experience better as you can break the experience however, it provides a lot of capabilities. 

Everything that is currently in the game feels and looks unique and drives the exploratory nature as you play.

The variety in resources, and equipment are amazing, in fact having this variety is currently what drives most of the  current replay ability as each map seed creates a different look and feel with scarce open plains to densely resource filled maps. with different resources available on each seed.

The Seasonal effects and time spent within each greatly help the current depth of the game and what it can be.

Conclusion
If you like games like Rimworld, you will like this game and will probably spend countless hours on it even in its current state. Devs are active and consistently working on the game so there is more to look forward to with an already good game. Just understand the game is EA its lacking in areas but excelling in others.",1.0
