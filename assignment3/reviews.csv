16,136555240,2156300,In its current state I wouldn't recommend this game. It has potential but if every episode is going to be 30 minutes of game play its not worth it. There were bugs and accessing the pause menu is impossible to work if there's any sort of interaction on the screen. It's impossible to turn the music off and there's no way to roll-back or remove the ui to look at the renders. Also not being able to skip at certain points can get rather annoying and opening the logs just throws up errors. The beta felt longer than all the new content and even then a lot of the new content was already show in the trailers and renders that have been released.,0

20,136572986,2357670,"If you're a fan of strategic gameplay and love collecting cards, then this card battler game is definitely for you! This game is a perfect combination of card collection, deck building, and tactical combat. It is very easy to pick up and play but has enough depth to encourage replays to improve your strategy.

The hand-drawn artwork in this game is awesome, from the unique and varied card designs to the incredibly detailed backgrounds and interfaces. The music is fantastic and perfectly suits the action in the game. Each card has its own strengths and weaknesses that can be augmented with skills and loot, so each round requires careful consideration and strategic thinking.

Overall I really enjoy Fourteen Fiends for its fun, quick gameplay and the potential for deeper strategy from different combinations of cards. Highly recommended!",1
21,136573277,1409300,"What a great start by Pendopo Creations to take a debut step in a early Q2 2023. This game kinda remind me of Lacuna and Virtua Verse since those games look pretty similar. But, review is review so I'm gonna tell what I felt and experienced while playing this game. 

Start by the premise of story, Setyo starting to take a step in Bay City as a foreign agent and then as a security of a tech company. While his colleague, Jack, who works in Bureau appearing in Bay City and gave Setyo a bad news about the lost of his sister so it forced Setyo coming back to Neo-Surabaya and find some clues about his sister. All I can say, the plot is properly wrapped in a 6 chapters in total which makes the story more focused. The story doesn't feel rushed at all. Plot is surprisingly attractive so the experience kinda similar as watching a movie. Besides that, the dialog is well written in english. So, from the story aspect, I could say this game is a have a great plot, not rushed, and a well-written dialog. 

For Indonesian folks, trust me, some of the dialog is so much related to our culture and society nowadays. One of my favorite is while there's a conversation talking about ""a department"" of a country that loved to block an access of one of a biggest game marketplace in a world.
Story: 8/10

Move into the gameplay, this game, put it simply, is an action adventure game with a side-scrolling thingy like Lacuna and VirtuaVerse. The most important value that been delivered by dev to this game is at puzzle and combat mechanics. Puzzle mechs are variative which make this game has a bit of repetitive level. I'm sure that you're not gonna get bored while facing all puzzles in every chapter on this game. Okay, let's say some of them are stealth, hacking like a Watchdogs game, bunker code solving, making a key, ""stay calm while disguise"" with a rythm alike system, etc. There's so much variation of puzzle so I can't put it here all one by one. Besides puzzle thingy, this game also have a freedom for us to fight some foes with any weapon and a combat system. A combat system is quite okay, i think. One thing that annoyed me is just an energy and consumable items while in a fight. Energy drought so fast and consumable items a bit complicated since you need to open an inventory first and the consume the item. It will be better IF this game giving us a ""quick action button"" so we don't need to try hard anymore. 
Gameplay: 7,5/10

The graphics is lovely jubbly. Imagine, the composition of 2.5D pixelated game combined with a proper lighting and synthwave colour tone is just right. It looks satisfying. This game is actually worth for some players who loves to see a pixelated or cyberpunk game themed. Give it a try!
Graphics: 8.5/10

Finally, talking about sound/audio. All I can say is the background music is well delivered in any situation so the tense properly build up while playing the game. When we need to be relax, stressed, pressured, it's all depicted good by a presence of a cyberpunk themed music. 
Sound: 7/10

So, in the end, the pros and cons of this game are
Pros:
+Better plot, movie alike and doesn't feel cheap. 
+Puzzle mechs variative which makes the experience doesn't feel bored.
+Dialog is well written, some of them talking about Indonesian culture and society issues
+Oooomagaaa, the graphics bro, beautiful. 
+There is so many Indonesian thingy in a game like tukang sate, kang cilok, preman, pertunjukan seni, etc while the game is delivered to be fantasy futuristic. 

Cons: 
- Game still buggy and stuck at loading because of steam overlay. pro tip: don't ever open a steam overlay while playing the game. Let's hope the dev will fix it, asap.
- Combat system duh idk, all i want is a ""quick action button"" and some clarity improvement while in a stealth mission. 
- Bahasa Indonesianya ga ada cookkk, semoga ntar ditambahin hehe, ksabar.
- There is no manual saving

Overall, this game is at 7,75/10. Is this recommended? Yes, it is recommended. With this rate of price, you can get an experience of exploring to a deep down of an Indonesian greatest civilization with hi-tech thingy with a great story and puzzle mechs. Let's go give em a try!

The well thought out story and interaction with the characters drew me into this game. I was surprised that such a simple looking game had multiple endings to choose from. This gave me the incentive to explore other story options. If you love puzzles, kittens, and all things cute, this game is definitely for you! 😻",1
25,136574485,1949030,"I'm only 4 hours in but I wanted to say that I love this game. It's different from the other Frogwares Sherlock Holmes games in that you are solving one grand overarching mystery rather than individual cases, so I haven't had the experience of having to pick who I thought did it with what in that intense and wonderful way that the other games have, but the story that it is telling is so damn compelling that I don't care. I'm still finding clues and slowly piecing together what's happening, all while people are dying and crazy supernatural stuff is happening around me.

The juxtaposition of Lovecraft and Holmes works perfectly, the aesthetics combine well, and I love Holmes' analytical mind trying to work out why there's weird supernatural bullshit happening. I'm super excited to find out what is going on. 

On the mechanical side, this game uses the same engine as Chapter One but adds some excellent quality of life improvements. For one, I think the open world was a detriment to Chapter One, and this one is much more linear which is good. For another you can click Z to have all of the interactable items pop up around you, which is an amazing thing to have in this sort of mystery adventure game.

Special shoutout to the characterization, writing, and acting of Watson in this, he is so good.

Very excited to continue, and congrats to Frogwares for a great game.",1
26,136573584,1949030,"Love this game! It builds upon the characters and game design of the previous game, but with a much darker atmosphere.

27,136573460,1934040,"At the release date this game feels like its unfinished. i have not found any outstanding bugs or irregularities in performance but after only a few hours of actual gameplay it feels really repetitive without foresight to further complexity or progression.
It is fun and quite relaxing but sadly there is not enough gameplay for me to come back to the game if this is the ""Final"" version.

I hope to see this game develop more and watch it become something i could spend years playing, but for now i would be bored after 10 hours of gameplay and in 13 hours i would have all the achievements.",0
28,119682629,1729900,"Now let me get this out of the way. The game has potential. But right now it's very clearly unfinished. My first problem is there being no tutorial, thankfully somebody posted a guide explaining the basic mechanics. Apparently there's a flow mode and different characters have different things they specialize in (For example: More damage but you take more damage, stronger flow mode, etc.) But I didn't even realize this for the first 10 minutes since none of this is explained to you. Even the guide doesn't specify what character does what. Also, speaking of characters. Their designs for most of them are unfinished. One character looks like they got somebody else to draw smoothly. The rest though are hand drawn models that look like a deveant art OC. Hell, in actual matches there's not even the character model. Just a rough sketch with basic outlines. Now (In my opinion) the worst thing about this game is there's no online multiplayer. Sure you CAN play with friends. But that seems local only. It could be a 6/10 with the online multiplayers, but without it (including the rest of my points) it drops down to about a 4-5/10. Fix all these issues and you got a solid 7-8/10 rythm Game.
TLDR; Add a tutorial and online multiplayer, along with finishing the characters and you get a solid game.",0
29,118681190,1729900,"Rhythm Brawl is a laughably poor Guitar Hero ripoff with an adversarial bent as you play a 3 button rhythm game to some pretty craptastic music and wonder why Valve doesn't have the quality control for Steam it so badly needs.  There's a few different game modes and you can play PvP or vs the computer or just watch the computer play itself, this is convenient because while the computer is playing itself you can go find a pencil to rupture your eardrums so you don't have to listen to the crap music anymore.  Very thoughtful of the developers there. 

The nicest thing I can say about this is that it doesn't use 2D retro pixel ""art"".  Unfortunately, instead, it uses some of the most eye gougingly bad high school art class dropout drawings (I won't deign to call that scribbling ""art"") instead.  Like really bad.  Pixel art would be better, seriously, it's atrocious.  The developers indicated they would replace it, but that hasn't happened yet, so the game gets judged for what it is. 

There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.

Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the Godot game engine/toolset.  This is a very poor quality toolset sometimes used by amateur developers as it's free (so they don't have to pay for GameMaker Studio) and doesn't require advanced game development skills, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities (it's arguably worse than GameMaker Studio).  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.

They're seriously trying to charge money for this, $4 USD plus an eye watering $8 USD to unlock the rest of the game they haven't finished (yeah, there's DLC for an incomplete Early Access game, that's not okay to the point of being unethical).  All that for a business model to try compete with Spotify by charging $12 USD for 6 crap songs on Steam.  Ugh.  If you play this game I recommend proactively seeing an oncologist afterwards.",0
30,121230865,1729900,"Rhythm Brawl, unlike most games I don't recommend, has A LOT of promise. I VERY MUCH so hope this game gets an update that fixes all issues, because I believe that this game could be something magical if fixed in the future. also I HIGHLY encourage the developer/developers to reply to this message once an update is put out! I would love to change this review to a recommend.

First off, A LOT of the art is unfinished. I'm of the belief that if you plan on making a commercial product, you HAVE to finish those kinds of assets beforehand. I understand this game is in Early Access, but this feels like an EARLY EARLY ACCESS. A would love to also see different character have different passive abilities and maybe an attack move that's different per character. More music would be awesome as well. 

Along with this, online play would be huge for a game like this. My final thoughts are that if you add Steam Workshop this could be the defacto Rhythm Fighting game that people have been begging for. You have something special here. Please add Steam Workshop. Other than that, if the game fixes these issues, this will be an incredible game.",0

47,136552308,2364030,"[h1]Experienced on the Meta Quest 2[/h1]

You can view my initial impressions review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/9Wax1TLL-gc

Anybody who follows my reviews knows that I absolutely love VR roller coaster / amusement park rides. So this game should be right up my alley, a fun twist on the coaster formula with some action adventure thrown in. 

Yeah, this game took everything I enjoy about coasters and made it into a bland, repetitive game that sucks all the joy & thrills from fun rides. It's a poorly made game on the Unreal Engine. At least it seemed be to be running at a steady 90 fps on my RTX 3080 and it did not crash. That ends anything positive I can say about this experience.

The visuals are ugly. The UI is horrible. Your motion controllers (at least on the Quest Touch controllers) are mis-aligned with your avatar pickaxes / shield that you hold. The feedback from any action is terrible. I couldn't tell whether I had hit an object or if I had correctly blocked or dodged out of the way. The sounds are bad as well. The music is bad. The gameplay is bland and repetitive. 

I would not recommend this game if it were free to play. I wanted to quit after 30 minutes of gameplay. I went with my gut feelings to quit and do anything else. Maybe someone out there can play this game for longer than 30 minutes, but for my own sanity I will uninstall this game and never play it again.

It's nuts and easily one of the better ""Vampire Survivor-likes"" out there. If you're looking for a wild time where you spent a few minutes between rounds figuring out a ton of gimmicks to chain together to create utter nonsense before you fight again, this is for you. It's more or less an ""engine building"" game, where one thing triggers another thing and efficiency buffs damage and things... Start off with a simple Spine and a tentacle gun, make it so that tentacle gun bursts into a giant skeleton blade on contact and poisons things. Use another brain to maybe build a function that connects all enemies who are poisons to be chains together by a death beam that saps their health for five seconds. Now do that for a default (for most prototype characters) for 8 total modules and level up to maybe 12, and up to four brains doing different things. Want to go summoner? Take a Queen and pick up every spawn thing you can, make them shoot instead of you or carry around debuff clouds. Want to machine gun things? Take a bunch of piercing tentacles and boxer nerves to trigger a lot of ""on hit do this"" commands. Don't worry about committing to stuff... you can tear these structures all down and reuse your components or sell them off between fights. Also has a trial mode so you can test your crazy thing before you actually have to worry about dying. 

Freaking fantastic. Thoughtful, strange, and something to really make you think a bit to optimize. Only real complaint at the moment is enemies mostly just run at you at various speeds and take more or less damage. Feels like they're just messing around to get all the node building right at the moment and maybe enemies become more interesting in the future. Still, worth it just to screw with.

[i]Simple Sky[/i] is top-down twin-stick space-shooter/score-chaser with some unique ideas. The simple and bright artwork gives the game a friendly appearance, but after I headed into the main game, I quickly realized that it gives the player no quarter. There are 10 difficulty settings, and only two are unlocked in the very beginning. Well, so far, I have yet to unlock another. Please keep in mind that this game is in Early Access currently, and some of my discussion may be outdated by the time you are looking at the game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The idea is simple, you start off as a ship with a main and secondary weapon, all of your movements use your energy reserves that spontaneously regenerate, and every action has a cooldown. Enemies start coming after you in what almost seems like a survival arena and you need to fend them off until the boss encounter for that particular stage, after which you can complete the stage and move on or stay behind to gather some more resources, though with a finite absolute time limit. There's a visual countdown to when things start going haywire if you stay too long, so it's not difficult to gauge this.

During your time spent on any level, finding local planets of various sizes and mining their resources will be very important. These resources are currency that you also get by killing enemies and you can upgrade your ship every time you reach a preset ""value."" You need to be docked on a planet while you upgrade, and this isn't difficult, you can run headfirst into a planet and that counts as docking.

When you make an upgrade, you are given a choice from 3 random selections. You can gradually maximize your firepower, your abilities, your cooldowns, HP, etc. through your various upgrades. You can even increase how many selections you get when you upgrade. If you get lucky early on, you can take an upgrade to make it possible to upgrade mid-flight, which doesn't seem like much, but is actually a huge boon. Or at least I think so.

In each level, you are constantly being hunted by the boss, which slowly approaches you from afar. You can see where it is and where you are, along with locations of the different planets on the minimap. It would seem that either avoiding the boss in the beginning or heading right in may each have its own benefits, I have yet to figure out the perfect strategy.

The individual runs in this game are usually pretty short. If I don't have a good combination going for me from the first few upgrades, I find that I can rarely make it to or past the 2nd boss. With some nice upgrades working in nice synergy, I was able to get to what I thought to be the final boss on the easiest difficulty, though I still struggled to live to the end. I would say average runs for me when things are going well are around 15 minutes or so.

There is a lot of movement based on your momentum, and because you are a ship moving around in space, you can expect to have some arcing movements and annoying ""sliding-on-ice"" feel as you try to maneuver around. This is just something to get used to, it's a game decision that will make a lot of people throw their hands in frustration but it's a decision specifically for this game. Once you get used to it, it won't feel so bad.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
Keyboard and Mouse required, and for some reason I had to launch this on my laptop, since on my main PC, the keyboard was being recognized in the menu, but once the run started, it wouldn't respond. I do hope that this gets hashed out and not too many people buy and need to refund due to unrecognized keyboard controls.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The artwork in this game is nothing to write home about, everything is pretty simplistic in design. It has bright colors and simple designs that give it a bit more friendly appearance, but the game mechanics beg to differ.

[h1]Music & Sounds[/h1]
The music gets super repetitive, to the point that I had to turn it off

[h1]Audience[/h1]
This is where I struggle a bit. I would say more for people who don't mind repetitive deaths and are okay with working through the initial slow bits in an arena-survival/shooter game. The run becomes more enjoyable when you can survive the initial start-up phase, which can be over quickly if things fall in nicely, but can also draw on for a while.

[h1]Pricing[/h1]
Early Access base price is $9.99 with regional pricing. It does have some replay value in that you are trying to chase the high-scores in kills during your runs while also trying to beat the game as fast as you can--the two leaderboards on Steam. I think the price is fair as far as people who enjoy the game are concerned. Those who cannot stand it have plenty of time to experience it prior to making a decision to refund, if truly they determine it's not worthwhile.

[h1]Personal Wishlist[/h1]
1. Have the issue fixed so I can play on my main computer, but the problem is that I have no idea what the issue is.
2. Having a bit simpler initial stages of each run when it comes to upgrades. I find that it's the part I enjoy the least and it tends to drag on for a while, and for me that's the do-or-die part of the run. If I make it, the rest of the run is enjoyable, if I die, then I have to start over from scratch and keep my fingers crossed.
3. More clear-cut synergy effects when upgrading, maybe showing some numbers/stats or highlighting which other prior upgrades will benefit, etc. It would be nice to know whether I am making a good decision or not when upgrading.
4. The mid-flight upgrade option comes up infrequently and I personally dislike the fact that I have to dock to upgrade prior to getting this. I almost wish the requirement to dock to upgrade would be removed completely.
5. More weapons/upgrade options, etc.

Bottom line in regards to this section is me saying that for these kinds of games to keep me interested, I need to see faster earlier progress to get to the fun parts, to keep me coming back and playing another run. It's not difficult to start another run after the previous, but the desire to immediately start is definitely hindered by the knowledge of the beginning grind. It may be only a few minutes, but it's enough to make me hesitate. With that and some additional QoL changes to facilitate smoother and more streamlined gameplay, I would enjoy it a lot more.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[i]Simple Sky[/i] is overall pretty fun, and so far I am enjoying myself. I realize that this game is in Early Access and so I hope to see some improvements in the aspects that I have requested, just to make it even more fun. I have confidence in that this developer will make the game better from its current build as there seems to be an update every time I look at it, especially with the latest one around a request that I had made.

Current score 7/10 (written Oct. 9, 2021).

Thank you for reading.

However, the upgrade system separates this title above the rest. A deep, complex chain of inter-dependent limbs and organs allows nearly infinite permutations, each one visually represented on the player's character. This is the Hades of swarm survivors.

Towers can't be upgraded once you've placed them, can only delete them and re-place others.
High-class towers can be purchased when you upgrade the shop. Some towers will give you skills and you can use them once each wave.
An interesting point is the combination of effects, for example the ice tower only slows the enemy, but when the enemy is wet, they can be frozen by the ice tower, and you can wet the enemy with traps or water tower.
A good tower defense game, but...

66,136552204,2109430,"A short but very sweet return to the Tron universe. My first playthrough lasted just over 2 hours, and I was fully engrossed the whole time. The developers perfectly captured the look and sound of the Grid, and the story and characters are very well written and feel true to the Tron universe. The puzzles were alright, not terrible but not to noteworthy either.

I would probably give it a high 7/10, maybe even 8/10 depending on how the other endings are (only gotten the bad ending so far)",1
67,136574855,1811990,"So something interesting- While I love roguelike deckbuilders, I frequently find myself frustrated with them. Slay the Spire, Dicey Dungeons, etc, they're fantastic, but bad luck can be extremely frustrating.

I'm not having this problem with Wildfrost.

Now obviously I've only played an hour so far, and I definitely haven't made much progress, but every time I've died so far, I've always felt like it's my fault in some way, whether I made a stupid decision or didn't prepare well, and even in the times when RNG has screwed me via lacking options for card synergy or in-battle junk, it still feels so much less frustrating than in other roguelike deckbuilders. I think this is partially because of the way the gameplay is structured; there's no obvious endpoint, just a continuing path, and you're not spammed with cards or the like. Every encounter keeps you incredibly invested with how you're strategizing, and even when you lose, the progression with the town can help you still feel as though you're making progress.

If you really want to try this game but aren't entirely sure, I'd say go for it. I'm having a blast so far and the literal only reason I'm taking a break after an hour is because I, unfortunately, have important things to do T_T But I will absolutely be back ASAP to see more of this game.

I don't know what happened but unfortunately the game barely received any updates during the Early access period and was left in an incomplete state that just make it hard to recommend to anyone. The Early Access tag was simply removed during release day without any content update, which means that the devs were unable to continue working on the game for any reason.

87,136514584,2227150,"Pretty neat platformer, controls are tight. Jumps are easy to make, and a good variety in stages. I'm going to lead with letting you know this game is very short, but it is enjoyable its entire duration.

 I think a good thing to do after beating all the levels and collecting all the 40 (? it was an even number I arrived at and I stopped seeing anymore) green coins is to try to beat all the levels with sub-one minute times. The levels feel like they're specifically engineered for this time frame in mind and it forces you to play creatively. 

I want to see this expanded into a larger game. I think the mechanics are polished and the understanding of how to implement platforming gimmicks is there. The dev is obviously very skilled at what they do. I think I got more than 3 dollars of fun out of this. I think an expansion on the concept should provide a purpose to the in game timer, such as beating a dev time or maybe a standalone collectable like the crash bandicoot games.

This is a ringing endorsement but I am going to post the few observances I have with the game after this, as well as my level times. (played with a controller)

good
+ All platforming is incredibly tight and telegraphed very well. 
+ The little overworld is very fun to navigate however small it is. There is one out of the way place that immediately opens a warp after getting it and you can actually skip a few intended platforming parts using the core mechanics.

neutral
= there is an acceleration you have with gliding, it feels like the opposite of what gliding would normally do. I consider this neutral because after you get used to it it feels very satisfying to move around, but there is a learning curve.
= physics with any moving stage gimmicks can be odd at times. It's consistent and you can actually use little things like leverage from spinning platforms to push yourself upwards a bit for more air but it may not do what you expect at first.
= In my opinion, I think the gold coins should be finite. It would give an easy third goal to the areas, and you can very easily afford everything even without the respawns. being able to grind it feels like I didn't earn it. I don't know how much I can criticize the economy in a 3d platformer though. 

bad (these are really really minor issues)
- recovery from a dive seems inconsistent. Sometimes I can recover and other times I feel like I can't and go barreling off the edge. This feels intentional but I couldn't get a feel for what triggered specific reactions.
- The camera snap during the sections where you're repeatedly hitting boosts is a little jarring. This only happens once or twice.
- I would like a little page in the menu that tells you all the information from the levels you completed. this is small but would be important for a larger game. It would have made tracking my level times at the end slightly easier too.

[b]+ A captivating twin-stick shooter metroidvania game with a physics-based grapple and engaging story!ヽ(´• ω •`)、[/b]

[h1][b][1] Intro [/b][/h1]
Rusted Moss is a twin-stick shooter metroidvania game that features a physics-based grapple and full 360° aiming system. Set in a wasteland once inhabited by humans, this game provides a challenging and immersive experience that allows users to feel in complete control of their character.

[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]

The game's twin-stick shooter aspect emphasizes tight and precise gunplay, with players quickly switching between their arsenal of weapons to best suit their playstyle and situation. Players can get up close and personal with a shotgun before grappling away and pulling out a sniper for the killing blow.

The grappling hook is the standout feature of the game, which takes some time to learn but is ultimately rewarding to master. The physics-based elastic grappling hook allows players to latch onto any moss-covered structure and swing their way through the rugged terrain. The freedom created by the controls creates a smooth experience, allowing for creative solutions to flexible traversal challenges.

The game offers a challenging experience, with powerful witches and machine monstrosities as the bosses. Each boss fight throws its own unique challenge at the player, requiring them to push their gunplay and grappling hook skills to their limits. Players must dodge swords, avoid energy fields, and blast away at conjured spiders to progress.

The game features beautifully melancholic pixel art with a retro vibe and modern aesthetic, bringing the world of Rusted Moss to life with moody pixels and stylish animation. The game also offers customizable strategy and gameplay, multiple endings, and encounters with humans and fae folk who are trying to find their way through the world.

[h1][b][3] Verdict [/b][/h1]
In conclusion, Rusted Moss is a fantastic metroidvania game that provides a challenging and immersive experience with its physics-based grapple, twin-stick shooter gameplay, and engaging story. The game's pixel art and aesthetic add to the overall experience, making it a must-play for fans of the genre.

This game is a MASSIVE step up from the first game in every way. The music, the movement, the effects, the editor, literally everything. All of the tracks are diverse with different genres that one or two might have a special place in your heart, the movement being silky smooth makes the experience much more better and doesn't feel clunky at all, (unlike Soundodger+) the effects give the levels a much more stronger vibe to them and the freedom you have in the editor this time is insane. The game can sometimes not be very friendly with new players I'm gonna be honest and adding the shatter system on top of that can definitely ruin a players experience if they just want to play all of the levels for fun, but for people who want a challenge will most likely enjoy it. I've mostly spent my time on the editor on this game, but the main levels are really fun to play and the challenge level have cool mechanics that challenge your skill in unique and different ways. The easy and normal levels sometimes can feel lackluster, boring, slow, empty, etc. The advanced and expert levels can give you the real fun of the game. (though sometimes they're a big difficulty jump from their easier counterparts.)

132,136513050,2334560,"The concept and art are fine, but the game's mechanics and other design decisions prevent it from being enjoyable to play. 

The protagonist of the tale is a mixed-race fox who aspires to be something other than an alcoholic slacker. Let's just say that the story is quite basic and that your overall goal is to change your destiny.

The game plays like any other action/platformer. You can jump, scale walls, and attack. You immediately realize that the stamina system is involved in all actions, which is fine when done correctly and just for certain acts. However, in this game it’s highly aggravating because jumping also depletes your stamina. Platformers require a lot of jumping, thus you'll spend most of your time waiting for it to fully recharge before making a jump. Then wait once again on the following platform. And again.

The same goes for combat. Each battle becomes a chore due to the very slow recharge. You're moving around wasting a lot of your stamina trying to gather enough for just one hit. When you have enough experience points, you can increase your stats, but you must first kill enemies who use a totally absurd mechanic.

Enemies are brainless. They will follow you anywhere you go if you are in their line of sight, including across ledges, into pits, under spikes, etc. It is usually simpler to lure them into traps, which kill them and leave their corpse hovering in the air.

The game goes with old-school style of progress, which means linear path and no option to revisit stages. Even if stages include numerous paths and secret spots with gold and treasure, it's difficult to collect everything because it's so easy to die. Furthermore, if you just head for the exit, you can make things much tougher for yourself because each coin and experience point is valuable.

The overall difficulty of the game was the final straw that broke my back. There are traps everywhere, coming out of nowhere and taking cheap shots at you. Even if you survive falling into a hole, you most likely won't have the strength to climb out.

What makes this even more annoying is the lack of checkpoints. If you die, everything you collect is lost and entire progress reset. Any kind of exploration is entirely discouraged because you don’t want to spend time by carefully navigating the stage, collecting everything you can and then get killed by a stray arrow.

If you're like me and you're desperate for anything remotely good in VR, this will not suit your needs more than likely. Unless you and a friend are okay with wasting money on a thing you'll probably play for 20 minutes, then, I don't recommend this game. 

The physics is... fine? It's better than most other VR titles, and the full body part is the best aspect of it. However, meleeing with anything feels very bad, there's no sense of impact or collision. You can stick things to other things and make weird things, so in that way it's like GMOD but with like 3 tools. Gun, flight, and sticking things to other things. In it's current shape it's not worth the price of admission, and I couldn't convince any of my friends to get this game, so this is a review from the perspective of someone who put more hours than I'm willing to admit into single player GMOD. 

The interaction spheres appear under alarmingly specific circumstances, the gun interactions are bad/very inconsistent. Even holding things seems wonky, since I picked up two things with one hand, which I don't believe was intentional, because when I dropped both one permanently was stuck to my interaction button, so if I tried to take a mag out of my pocket, it would send me flying toward the corner of the map, since the 'jet' thing was still bound to my hand despite clipping into the ground never to be found again. I experienced this bug within like 15 minutes of play, and it happened to *both* of my hands. It seems like too big of an oversight. 

That being said, if this game got workshop support, fixed their interactions, upgraded melee, and allowed people to make some mini-levels to coop through with your friends (puzzles, combat, etc) or even had a miniture proof of concept coop campaign or even a wave mode, this game might begin to be worth your time and money. I went in with pretty low expectations, and even those weren't met. 

I'm not the biggest fan of Boneworks/Bonelab, but this game needs a few more months of [b]core changes[/b] to come even remotely close to the level of physics and interaction those games achieve. I understand this is likely a much smaller dev team with far fewer resources, but there's a lot left on the table for them to address.

I recommend this game for Tron fans. 
For visual novel fans I don't know what to say since I'm not a visual novel kinda guy. 

[h1] Story wise [/h1]
I enjoyed what it had to offer, more so on the character side who are all written well with decent enough motivations. The problem that lies in the narrative is the fact that this is not a game that has concrete ending. I had actually seen a D23 article this morning stating that there will be more Tron games by Bithell Games.
Last bullet point in this article [b] (https://d23.com/decoding-the-grid-a-conversation-with-tron-identity-producer-heidy-vargas/) [/b]

Why this was not said long before the game came out that this would be a multi part story is beyond me. Maybe I missed this information? Someone please correct me if so

Another positive about the story is that choices actually matter, given how many AAA games tote this saying plenty of times without delivering, this deserves to be commended, granted I will say the outcomes of your choices are very obvious and have very little surprise to them but that's fine given the scope of the game.

[h1] Game-play wise [/h1]
There is only type of puzzle which is not at all challenging. It appears quite frequently, almost at every story juncture with a certain character, due to the short run time of the game it thankfully never outstays it's welcome. It can also be skipped if you don't care much about it. 

[h1] Tron wise [/h1]
The tiny little nods and references to the movies (achievement names, certain codex entries) were well done. The new additions to the lore are cool and feel like they fit. World building is very subtle yet it's enough to set the stage of the world but it very much a start for the obvious sequels to come. The music is quite good, it's no Daft Punk or Joseph Trapanese but it's up there and is honestly quite memorable.

154,136566115,694990,"An old-school platformer with a lot of heart.

The game's controls are responsive, and the progression is well-paced. Throughout the levels, our goblin collects scattered coins which can be spent on upgrades, such as the beloved double-jump. Cleared levels can be replayed at any time, allowing him to access previously unreachable areas with his newfound abilities. For those seeking an extra challenge, the game can be completed without any upgrades, with an achievement as a reward. From time to time the goblin will encounter bosses, which, although easier compared to the levels themselves, are creative and add a nice variety to the gameplay.

An interesting aspect of the game is that all the sound effects are created using the developer's voice, which may initially feel unusual and take some time to get used to. Some players may find it awkward or irritating. However, it's worth noting that the game was made by one person, and this unique approach to sound effects adds to its overall ""hand-crafted"" feel.

It's impossible to die completely in this game. When all continues are lost, the goblin is sent to the Underworld level with infinite attempts (after all, you can't die when you're already dead), and clearing it resurrects him with 15 extra continues. This process can be repeated indefinitely, ensuring that the player won't lose all of their progress and have to start over. However, the game can still provide a challenge, especially for those aiming to collect all the coins.

Overall, this game is a great choice for satisfying old-school platforming cravings. It never gets boring thanks to unique and varied level designs, enjoyable boss fights, appealing pixel art, and just the right amount of difficulty to keep the player engaged. The only minor downside is that it runs at 30 fps due to engine limitations, but it doesn't detract from the overall experience. 
Give it a try – you might just enjoy it.

First and foremost, allow me to say that Caliber hasn't always been the game that it is now. If you have ever heard anything negative about this game, chances are those things no longer exist. The developers have been very open and willing to listen to the community in order to make this game worthwhile. And with that said, Caliber is certainly a game worth playing.

If you've ever played Ghost Recon Phantoms or SOCOM, Caliber is basically the spiritual successor to these classic third person shooters. There are a ton of unique operators to pick from, team based gameplay in which each person fills in their own role, fun co-op missions, various game modes, and no P2W. If you're a fan of third person shooters, tactical shooters, or shooters in general, you absolutely should give Caliber a try.

As someone that has been playing games since the early 90s, I would like to thank the developers for not only listening to the community in order to improve this game, but for making such a game to begin with. Caliber offers up a nostalgic experience, harkening back to a time when shooters weren't mindless, and horribly generic. You've done good, 1C. Keep it up!",1

179,136565458,2094270,"Lightracer Spark is a visual novel set in a Sci-Fi world. It's pretty much a narrative game where your choices matter as you progress through story. There are also some strategy elements, such as building various buildings, collecting resources, implementing space stations modules etc. I have to say that this game really surprised me how well made it is. 

Story/Narrative:

I have to say that story is quite well written and everything is connected with each other. There is a lot of text to read, a lot of choices to make. Currently you can only play Chapter 1 (new chapters will come as DLCs) that has many mini chapters in it, and as you progress the story, you're able to learn a lot about who you are, what is your mission and what you're capable of doing. Prologue is some sort of Tutorial that shows you and teaches you how to play the game. The other chapters are specific stories that tell you about certain events. Now, the biggest pat of this game is that as Amender (controller of planets and universes) you have specific traits that influence the story. You can pick between 5 different paths and each brings unique traits and bonuses. In the story there will be some choices that you can complete and they have difficulty, ranging from very easy to very difficult. They do somewhat influence the story as it makes you get different ending and you don't collect all the information needed but the higher traits you have, the easier it is to complete them. For example, you'll have to talk about history of certain civilization and to complete that choice, you'll need decent knowledge on ""Strange Worlds"" that is a specific trait in the game. All in all, I have to stay that story is quite unique and it does get you hooked but I just wish that developers added the button that you can speed up the text since most of the time you yourself have to click Continue in order to progress through story and text is quite slow which leaves you enough time to read everything.

Strategy elements:

I personally think strategy elements don't influence the game that much. Yes, you have to collect resources such as energy points, technology points and population in order to complete some chapters, but at the same, you collect those quite fast and buildings are quite cheap to build. You can also upgrade them which allows you to gain resources faster. There are special buildings that do require some effort to build, and they bring you various bonuses and materials that are later required to build certain buildings. In general, it's not time consuming but you'll sometimes forget that they even exist or forget to upgrade them since you're mostly focused on the story. There is also war in this game. I personally think it's quite unfair for other provinces and countries to get attacked by you. Because you're technologically stronger and the higher population you have, the easier it is to recruit troops. Enemies are quite easy to kill and they won't pose a threat. I think it's more beneficial to just focus on your military rater than pure resources. 

Issues:

Even though the story is quite well written, music and images are well made, I can't suggest this game for everyone. First of all, the mechanics of the game are quite easy to master and the game doesn't offer much content. Yes this is visual novel, but at the same time developers could have given us something more unique to do in between the stories and the stories progress way toooo fast. As soon as you're done with one mini chapter, you can instantly go to the other. As I already mentioned, building and waging war isn't anything special and it really doesn't bring you much. Time in the game can be slowed down or fastened up. If you have enough time to read through chapters and chapters of the story and you really do like to immerse yourself in futuristic world where AI helps you with everything, then surely this game is for you.

183,136566892,307950,"I played the Caliber since early beta and, as one can see in my achievements list, collected nearly all content available for now. And what can I say about pros and cons of this game.

Pros:
+A lot of game modes, both PvP and PvE. Not all of them are equally populated but you can find a match even in not so popular modes pretty fast.
+Over 60 characters to choose from. Different operators offer different playstyles, some are good for mowing down bots, some are perfect for PvP.
+Nice visuals with decent system requirements.
+No 'pay2win' - all operators can be purchased with ingame currency (and you don't need to grind for weeks to buy one you like).

Cons:
-Visual customisation system are lacking. You can apply different camos to the operator but most ot it can be obtained only during events or for premium currency. Nearly all of the skins with really unique looks are premium.
-Leveling up the operator can be tiresome - later levels require lots of XP and credits to grind.

188,136569545,2156300,"I'll preface this by saying, it's still very early, and this is just one episode, but here are my impressions so far.
1.  There are really no options.  You have one woman to impress and god forbid you choose wrong in one of the options you have, she'll friendzone you.  If you didn't find her attractive (and I really didn't--she was too heavy for my taste), then too bad.  She's the only choice in the game so far.
2.  No roll back.  Did you hit one of the choices accidentally?  Too bad. Replay the entire thing, or create tons of saves as you go.
3.  This next one goes towards the ""dating sim"" aspect.  If the one woman pisses you off (which she did), there's no option to tell her to go **** herself and walk off.  You're forced to be nice.  I would really have liked a ""b*tch, I have enough friends"" option.  I've never let a woman friendzone me IRL, and I certainly don't want to do it in a game.  There's great satisfaction in ghosting women like that.
4.  I suppose because it was by the same people that did College Kings, I was expecting at least the chance to have some good, meaningless sex.  That was not to be the case.  I suppose this game is G rated, or PG at best.  My hope is that the more episodes that come out, the more this will change.  I can ""not have sex"" with as many women as I want IRL. There's no need to go to a game to do it.
5.  I both understand and enjoy the necessity to build up to a relationship.  It was my favorite part about games like BaD and College Kings, but both of those games gave you significant feedback when you did something that would cause a girl to friendzone you, or not like you, or whatever, and you weren't friendzoned... you were merely ""in progress"" and the girls kind of let you know that.  In this episode, I got friendzoned and had no idea why.  None.

Again, however, this is all after just one episode.  Perhaps there's still hope and I do look forward to the upcoming episodes, but the lack of a rollback option is just AWFUL!  If you want to add an ""ironman"" mode where you can't rollback, by all means, do so.  I generally do my first playthrough keeping as true to how I would personally answer as I can and some kind of ironman mode for that would be fine, but to force everyone to play that way every time is absurd.

TLDR: As far as the final recommendation, I'm going to say for those seeking an AVN, this isn't it.  This is a teenage visual novel at best... no adult content whatsoever.  The dialogue is fun, even funny at points, but in it's current 1 episode state, I can't in good conscience, recommend it in its current state.  I will update the review as new episodes are released.",0

190,136571418,1811990,"It's difficult, but not absurdly so - if you have played card based games in the past, you need to adapt to the unique counter twist this game puts on things. But the moment that clicks, it just becomes an incredibly fun puzzle to win the battles.

The runs are fairly short (an hour to two, depending on how long you think about turns), which is a real plus for me - I can play a single run and then hop and do something else for a while.
The progression unlocks different tribes (card sets) and some new cards, but the cards you have in the beginning are completely valid to win a run.
Cards can be upgraded in a run to focus on different builds.
The art style is amazing. The UI is great, it runs smooth and the music is incredibly cool.

And if you're 1 coin short in the shop and click an item repeatedly, the shop keeper takes pity on you and sells it regardless. Whats not to love?

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Setting & Writing[/h3]
Without much preamble, your non-customizable character is dropped onto a tiny speck of land in the middle of the sea. Soon you notice the ability of creating more squares of terrain around you, and do so to expand the world map itself. There’s no story or lore to speak of, other than you have to survive in the wilderness by any means necessary, as the night is dangerous, while the day is peaceful.

 As much as sandbox games can be far from being story-oriented, the complete absence of any narrative element is a strong malus when there isn’t enough variety to compensate for it. The world itself is composed of tiles belonging to various biomes, each has a colorful and vibrant palette, but also feels static; there are no changes in the weather, and no interactions between confining climates or between animals, monsters and plants. Like a diorama with a few moving parts.

[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]
You’ll explore the world you yourself create on foot, or later on via mounted animals. Speaking of expansion, each new day will have you choose some “cards” belonging to different biomes, to then place them as tiles to expand the map. Each climate has different animals and resources, so varying the composition is fundamental to access all materials for crafting. 

The sense of discovery typical of an open-world survival is largely lost and washed-out, as even after many days the explorable world, including the underground level and the “enchanted dimension”, all matching in size, will still be small in size. You won’t even need a map for orienteering, and there isn’t one. As you roam these tiny expanses, you won’t witness interesting random events, rare spawns or other points of interest spawning at any point. The best you’ll get are goblin traders that you can shelter and house in your base, or animals to kill or capture and breed. The interest wanes after only a couple of hours, as you’ll have seen everything by then.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960459835

[h3]Combat System[/h3]
At night, monsters will spawn on any non-player made tile. The inside of your (hopefully) walled base is safe, but outside the hordes are relentless. Enemies vary per biome: for instance the ice biome will have evil snowmen, the underground caves have explosive spiders, and the enchanted dimension have floating, energy-shooting abominations. The way to defeat each foe  is always the same: kite them in a circle and keep slashing in melee, or wait between shooting patterns for ranged enemies. All of them have one attack pattern and follow mostly the same archetype, with minimal variations.

Your choice of weapons is limited to swords, throwing spears or, if you grind trader reputation enough, slings. Each of them has a single attack, with the sling capable of flinging various crystals and bombs as an exception. Enemies become repetitive and stale not after long, while the combat system simply doesn’t have the depth to keep being engaging. No armors, accessories, upgrades, unique weapons and so on are present at any point. Blocking? Parry? Dodge? Anything? Nah, forget it. Minecraft’s combat system is Dark Souls in comparison to Miniland Adventures.

[h3]Crafting & Base Building[/h3]
You’ll use four main workbenches to get anything done, from flooring to utility buildings, weapons and furniture. The crafting system is the typical one of any open-world survival, requiring you to have a certain amount of basic and processed materials to make a finished product. 

There’s no further elaboration or novelty to it. The economy is kinda broken, to the point I never used anything else than stone tools and Ruby (like Minecraft’s diamond) swords, as metal tools lasted too short compared to the effort to grind the materials to make new ones. Expect to take some time to have a spacious base with all the bells and whistles, even if most craftables are purely decorative or gimmicky - you won’t need them, unless you want to upgrade trader reputation by placing them in their rooms, which isn’t worth it anyway.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960460780

[h3]Trading & Farming[/h3]
Traders offer wares locked behind reputation tiers, gained by furnishing their rooms in specific ways. Some of these items can’t be obtained in any other way, however none of them is really worth the effort. The system exists and is even a decent concept, but has no incentive to be used. 

Farming works in a classic way: plant crops, water them daily or use an automated sprinkler, reap the fully-grown produce and repeat. Of course, some plants may only grow in certain soils or biomes, while animals won’t need care but eat specific vegetables to breed and have more to harvest, like sheep for wool to make an example.",0

200,136562691,1949030,"The narrative is fantastic if you are a fan of Sherlock and Lovecraft however the game is not as big as the previous game, Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One but I honestly cannot complain. The devs did an amazing job and I have not experienced any bugs during this day one release.

It can be played as a standalone game but I highly recommend playing Chapter One as well!",1
201,136560024,2156300,"They clearly said Unscripted was going to different from their other game.  And it is.  It has more depth,  more characterization, more backstory, more interactions. Your MC has to actually work at developing a relationship with a female character  that wants more out of life. It's not a ridiculously stupid AVN,  which is the typical  visual novel genre,  but the audience for those stories are immature frat-boys or really damaged misogynists. It took just about two hour to play through the story,  and the price might be a little steep for the one chapter,  but if we're getting additional chapters later on,  it'll be worth the investment. The art is good and the dialogue writing is well developed as well.",1
202,136559848,1949030,"This year has been a great period for horror game remakes between Dead Space and RE4, and now even Frogwares seems to be getting on board that train. If you aren't familiar with the older games in this series (like the one this is a remake of), you should know that despite this sharing a lot of the DNA of Chapter One, it isn't an open world game. There are a few small hub areas with occasional small diversions, and if you get the side quest dlc there's some side stuff to do throughout the first half of the game, but for the most part it's more like a traditional point-and-click adventure game campaign (which I consider a substantial plus, considering how poorly their attempts at open world games went). It's adjusted to be less inventory focused in favor of more of the modern investigation gameplay, but the main campaign is essentially one big ""case"", and it took me around 11 hours to get through everything. 

Its adherence to the original material comes as a slight detriment in some parts, because the pacing around the middle of the game was kind of a mess back then and to some extent it still is here, but a lot has been done to tidy things up and smooth over the rough edges. The writing is all around improved, the tone is more consistent across the board, and the story and puzzles have been changed up for the better. And compared to Chapter One, it's honestly just really nice to have Watson back again; I went into their previous game with an open mind towards Jon, but he just didn't have half the chemistry that these two have. There aren't any of Chapter One's unsolvable ""no right answer"" choices, and you never have to gun down a room full of enemies! It's just a fun game all around for mystery fans, and while it's not enough that I don't still miss the Crimes & Punishments style of gameplay and deduction, it's a level of compromise I'm happy to work with.

The original Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened was always a fairly substantial departure from what was normal for this series, injecting all sorts of horror and mysticism into the otherwise fairly grounded universe and then daring you to call it non-canon by bolting itself to the timeline with a single key plot element. I thought for sure that this would end up being more of a reimagining than a remake as a result, with it seeming to position itself as an official sequel to Chapter One, but it doesn't -- if anything, it gets even weirder at some moments, and I wouldn't have it any other way.",1
203,136559763,1949030,"No, it's still not on the level of Crimes and Punishments. It appears Frogwares just doesnt effin get it. We want the games to be more like C&P NOT what came after it. The design mistakes of The Sinking City and Chapter One are still present though they seemed to have realized the eavesdropping and combat sucked so they have been removed. Once again, you are asked to make choices on guesswork since they could really go either way, things will not be visible because you werent on the right viewmode or were not highlighting the the right clue. Yes, the silly pinning mechanic is still here, and the game wants to be a sequel to Chapter One, constantly referencing it. Chapter One was a mistake that should be forgotten, not referenced multiple times within the first minutes. You already have a foundation to build on, it's called Crimes and Punishments. The mind map has been simplified yet again, and in a more frustrating way that tells you what kind of clues to select and how many, in a much less intuitive or interesting way than select posibilities enabling a logic train of thought like the one in C&P and TDD. The new Mind Map is also ripe for frustration and bruteforcing as you will frequently know what the answer is, just not what evidence it wants as the chain of thought that leads to it (a common problem of detective games), or you know onlt the logic train to an answer and it comes out of Sherlock's ass since the player could not have pieced the finan deduction from the clues. I'm supposed to BE Sherlock, not WATCH and nudge Sherlock. This is not a Watson game.
Also, in that respect, the Imagination mechanic still solves the whole thing for you. You play a game of ordering very vague but still chronologically simple to follow events, but then Sherlock fills in all the blanks sometimes with plenty of information you didnt glean at all or couldnt be sure of. The character does the detective work instead of the player who gets to play a minigame and watch. Yaaaay.
 And once again, side cases either dont get a mind map at all or get an even more simplified one.
Oh, and in a cruel twist of UX, the archive is now accesed by looking at clues. I bet many returning players will try to access it by frantically pacing around the two inches of 221B you can move through repeatedly befroe realizing that. I'm beginning to think the game lacked playtesting.
I'll probably finish it as I'm out of other games but if you were hoping for a return to form, sorry, no. It seems whomever is in charge now plain and simply doesnt get the appeal of the best detective game they made, and has no interest in building on it. They like what I consider to be their worse games too much and will continue on the path they laid foward in them. Shame. Chapter One was a mistake and they are happy to keep making it. Fire whomever is in charge of CO and this pseudo remake and get the people in charge of C&P back on board for the next one.
P.S: Credit where credit is due, the game is really well optimized and while the animations are lacking, the character models for Sherlock and John are great.",0
204,136560732,2060670,"It starts off promising enough, but having played the full release, I just don't know why you would play this over almost any other competent release in the new genre.

The graphics are neat, and there are a lot of interesting things presented - talents on level up that unlock a new set of talents, choosing your starting basic weapon, the watering thing is neat and the building stuff seems interesting. The problem is, you don't get to interact with it at all. You choose from 4 options on level up, and that includes ""potions"" which are basically temporary buffs. The pool of talents is MASSIVE, and not weighted (as far as I can see). You get 2 rerolls per floor, which amounts to about 8 rerolls per run, which is basically useless for actually trying to do ""a build"". If you choose one of those ""class"" talents that unlock more options (mechanic, ki, etc.) it gets even worse.

Basically all the choices are worthless because, like all these genre of games, you need synergy and multiplicative power to survive, which means just take the most basic, passive stat upgrades, and the basic fish summon skills, and do the same thing every run because everything else requires a staggering amount of luck in your favor to see work. 

You can experiment on the lowest tier difficulty a bit but even then you'll often just run into not killing stuff fast enough which means less xp which means less leveling which means killing stuff slower which means spending 5 minutes after the end of the level timer dodging endlessly while you whittle away the hp of the boss (or you could go onward and forsake even more xp). Oh also you obviously get WAY less rewards at the basic tier. Also unlocking higher tiers requires beating the previous tier, which means doing incrementally less forgiving runs over and over using the same builds over and over because anything else could mean wasting 15-20 minutes of your time and not knowing it until the choices keep failing to happen.

There is a fun game hidden here behind the insane lack of meaningful choices presented to the player. If the level up options were like, 8 choices instead of 4, it would STILL be more RNG than most of these games, but it might be more friendly to try out other builds. There's just no reason to recommend this because it's closer to playing a tedious slot machine than a bullet heaven.",0

All my criticisms are variations of ""I wish it was longer"" / ""I wish we got more time to know and interact with these characters""; it was about a 3-hour playthrough my first time, and you can certainly speed through it much faster after you've gone through once. I think getting all the achievements today I played it 6 or 7 times total, doing all the puzzles each time, and altogether that took maybe 10 hours.

If you're interested at all, definitely pick this up. It's worth it, and it helps support and encourage the developer while they work on the sequel(s) already underway to continue the story (and shows Disney that good Tron content is worth investing in).

229,136518027,2151770,"Fun action roguelike with unique art and interesting gameplay. It starts a bit slow, but gets a lot better once you grab a few perks.

The main gameplay is typical for the genre. You advance through randomly created floors, defeat enemies, gather coins to spend on better goods in shops, and open boxes with perks. Everything is lost upon death, with the exception of special keys and stat improvements.

The unique mechanic is the blue and yellow energy. Numerous things are connected to each energy, and you can change at will. Examples include opponents that can only be wounded with the appropriate energy and chests that open only with the matching color. 

Additionally, some weapons and perks are energy-specific; they simply don’t work if you have the opposite energy. Fortunately, most enemies are in neutral energy, so you won't have to continually switch during combat.

Three keys are unique to each floor and are hidden in unique puzzle areas. These challenges disable your ability to switch between energies but give you doors that, after you pass through them, switch between the two colors. The goal is to push boxes and use doors to reach the final room with the key. 

You keep these keys forever because they let you open unique chests that make subsequent runs a little bit simpler. But the most important is the puzzle room that gives you coins at the beginning of each run.

The reason you want to do that is that items are pricey. It's nearly impossible to purchase anything just by eliminating enemies that randomly drop a chest of coins once you finish clearing out a room. While your starting gun has unlimited ammo, the short range and fun factor just isn’t there because you simply can’t afford a better gun at the start. 

The game's subject is time travel and experiments, therefore each ""floor"" is set in a different time period. Most enemies show up in all the stages, but there are still enough distinct ones to keep the game interesting. Four floors might not see much, but there’s enough content here to keep you busy for a while. A nice addition is a library that gets filled with all the weapons, enemies and perks you encounter.",1

Pro:
1- Game looks nice and runs smooth (for me).
2. Good concept but could be lacking longevity or replayability.
3. 3 different mines on the map and map is large although a lot of wasted space

Cons:
1. A lot of the controls are not really explained clear enough- especially when it comes to assigning haulers to diggers. Make sure you assign the hauler first then the digger or you will waste a ton of resources.
2. When it comes to the second and third mine- to load the cargo onto the barge or train- make sure you hit the Q and E key to open and close the scoops. Also was not clear.
3- The drill rig was also very confusing at first- but the arms can rotate outwards much further than it appears. You just have to keep moving them in a circle format to fully extend them. Might be easier on controller but on keyboard it was a chore.
 4. My biggest complaint and an issue I might be overlooking:

Workers do not seem to continue to work if you are not in the mines. At least it seems that way to me. So not much reason to have all 3 mines working. As there is no fast travel and it takes for ever to travel between mines- I think I am going to sell all the machines at the first mine and just concentrate on either the 2nd or 3rd mine. Someone could clarify if I am missing something here.

Anyway- that is my 2 cents- thanks for taking the time to read it.",1

236,136569414,1772830,"TLDR: I highly recommend Rusted Moss.

************************************

I was one of the games playtesters and was fortunate to see the game grow over its development cycle. I have completed the game several times, and currently working through a play through of the release version. Even though my current hours on the release build are low, I am writing with the benefit of knowing what is coming from playing it first hand during tests.

Rusted Moss takes the standard metroidvania with double jumps and replaces it with a challenging but extremely satisfying grappling hook. Some people might find the grapple a challenge at first, but I found as I played more I was able to improve my skill quickly. And once you do.... wow this game really opens up. The satisfaction of landing a sick grappling sequence, or ""breaking"" the game in ways that while intended, allow for a high level of creativity in how you approach the game. Once the game 'clicks', you feel like Spider-Man swinging around as he pleases. The game also has optional climb challenges for those who stray off the beaten path that push the limits of the grappling hook even further. The grapple challenges alone would have justified my purchase as they are extremely fun and allow you to attempt to improve your time, pushing you to be better and better. However, the grapple isn't the only element of the game, and to ignore the other elements would be a mistake as they are also excellent.

The gunplay is tight and satisfying, and playing with mouse and keyboard allows for precise aiming giving me a sense of complete control of my character. When I make a mistake I know it was an execution issue on my end, not a cheap trick from the game. Save points are abundant, which allows you to experiment and go for challenges that otherwise might have seemed too risky. Boss fights have always been the thing I look forward to the most in metroidvanias and Rusted Moss does not disappoint on this front.  I especially love when the grappling hook is integrated into the fight itself as it adds a new element that I have not experienced before this.

The story is an interesting take with morally ambiguous characters, fighting for their lives in a war between the Fae and Humans. With talk of prophecies, secrets, traitors, and double agents, I was fully invested into the story and wanted to progress to find out what would happen next. The music of the game adds to the atmosphere beautifully, immersing me further and further into the game. Going from making me feel transported into the world, to being hyped during a boss fight, or even scared and uneasy in an optional zone that become my instant favourite.

If you are a fan of the metroidvania genre, Rusted Moss is a fresh take with a lot of fun challenges and upgrades to explore. I highly recommend the game, especially to those who ‘click’ with the grappling hook as it opens up the world in a way that I found exciting.",1

240,136554829,2109430,"I'm a big Tron fan, so I was naturally hyped when I saw this game announced. Now that I've finally played through it (just once so far, though I'm planning on replaying it to make different decisions), I find myself pleasantly surprised. The best Tron game I'd played before this one was either Tron 2.0 or Tron Evolution. I think this one is a lot more interesting than either of those, frankly. It's short, with my first playthrough clocking in around 2 hours, but there's definitely incentive to replay multiple times, as there are several decisions that affect the fates of characters and the roles they play in the story. And at $15, it's hard to be mad about a short runtime.

I really enjoyed the writing and the story here. I think this is the most existential and even political that Tron has ever been, and as a fan of the franchise, it's exciting to see a title that feels eager to dive deeper into the pre-established ideas and see what makes them tick. I saw on the writer/director's Twitter that they have multiple games/things already in development for the future of Tron, and if this is any indication of their quality, then I'm 100% on board.",1

This is the first piece of TRON lore that we have received in ten years!!! This is a great visual novel for players who love the genre, love TRON, or both. I'm still going through the game, but with my first play-through, I can tell that the writers took a lot of care and effort into recognizing and expanding on the intricate details of the TRON universe. 

However, the story is shorter than I would have wanted it to be. If you're a fast reader like I am, your play-through should take you 1-2 hours. Wish there was more to unlock and read. The $15 price does not justify this short length. 

Hopefully this is the only the tip of the iceberg for us to receive more TRON content. With the recent opening of the TRON Lightcycle / Run roller coaster at Walt Disney World and a third movie on the horizon, this is (hopefully) just the beginning.

HD version still proccesing!

This new visual novel is more of a romance story that is heavily focused on the stories of the characters present in it and I guess it tries to get the player invested in them too but, personally, I found it boring because from the start of the game all the dialogue was about your 3 friends and their inside jokes that I don't care much about (because there was no build-up to it, just loads of info about characters that I'm not invested in yet). Too much useless information and back-story all at once in the beginning (just my opinion). Other than that the characters look good and detailed, the story don't seem so far-fetched as it is in other visual novels, there are some animations and a lot of images. The price is kinda spicy but it seems that the devs want to release more episodes in the future at no extra charge.",1
255,136550188,2109430,"As someone who has been really enjoying the recent boom of excellent narrative games, and a pretty big fan of the Tron IP, personally I thought this game was excellent.

Really excited to see the direction of the future Tron games coming from Mike Bithell because this feels like a proof of concept (however an exceptionally good one).",1

Also can I just say the soundtrack and sound design is on POINT - had me genuinely at the edge of my desk whilst thinking through stressful and game-changing decisions, it really made the game 10x better for me! I also adore the cast of characters; super creative, characterised in a very engaging way, and wonderfully diverse as all programs should be <3

257,114308657,1729900,"Although I found some satisfaction in the game, the gameplay isn't very diverse. Jumps and jacks are the only patterns I've seen. Furthermore, I think there should be more settings, like the ability to change from downscroll to upscroll, as well as change the scroll speed like in normal rhythm games. It is also quite complex to learn the controls since you need to switch between different attacks while hitting different notes. I believe there should only be light attacks, heavy attacks, and blocks otherwise the gameplay would be too complicated since you would need to fight your opponent while hitting your notes with your other hand. Additionally, the mapping appears out of sync, especially in Vertigo. In order to preserve the true feeling of a singing competition between two great musicians, I believe more hard and upbeat songs should be added. I also find it strange that two people would be fighting while singing, but since that's the point of the game, I think it's fine. Moreover, I believe that different game modes, such as 4K, 7K, 9K, etc., should be added. As a conclusion, I think that hard charts and different genres of music should be added to keep the game from becoming boring and bland, and that more content should be added to allow players to discover what they're good at.

THE MAP:
The map is massive with nothing on it but roads. The world is basically just long roads leading to each mine with nothing in between. The garage/petrol station is a good idea but I didn't fill up the car once after the tutorial bit at the very start.

SOUNDS:
The sounds on this are just very bad...I muted my game when playing.

MINES:
All three mines are basically the same with nothing added to them (just a bigger area to walk across to sell coal). So this means that buying the other mines is a waste of time (you only have to buy them to get the achievement). 

WORKERS:
The workers don't actually work. 

MISSIONS:
At one point in the game the mission says "" Now you can build your coal empire"" and it basically stays the same no matter how much you earn, you can't advance any further than this. 

DISASTERS AND VEHICLE DAMAGE:
I am yet to see any disasters in the game which is indicated in the trailer, and no damage at all to vehicles (so it was pointless picking up the tool kit other than to fit that wheel at the start.....which you never have to do again.). If disasters and explosions actually happened I could maybe avoid that happening if I could actually buy a gas detector (The key command is in the menu but you cant buy one) and phones for the mines isn't working either which is also stated in the description.

I can't wait to sink my teeth into all this game has to offer",1
291,136565829,1811990,Addictive game with a fun learning curve. The runs themselves are nice and short but there is a lot of replayability as there's plenty to unlock and different strategies to discover.,1
292,136565722,1811990,"If you like roguelike deckbuilders and want a challenge you don't want to miss this!

The game is tough and your deck needs to have solutions for every situation, deckbuilding is much more complicated than just filling your deck up with matching keywords/synergies and winning the run on sheer power. It's worth noting that all of the battles in each run are interesting rather than the ""filler"" battles which many similar games feature.

Finally the theme/artwork are top notch and there is plenty of content to unlock to give the game some longevity!

298,136577403,1685730,"The game has a pleasing aesthetic and atmosphere to it. The journey takes us from colorful, vibrant landscapes, into medieval dungeons and murky swamps, which presents a welcome change of scenery and mood for each chapter.

The soundtrack is well done, each chapter has its own theme that fits the level and surrounding area, and the audio queues for being close to enemies or being spotted add some tension to the stealth gameplay.

The puzzles are well integrated into the levels, they're not too easy but also not very difficult, which makes it a chill experience while still offering a bit of a challenge. 

The stealth segments of the game have a good pacing to them, the levels aren't just extended sneaking sections, but a healthy combination of stealth and exploration with some puzzles thrown into the mix for some variety in gameplay.

I played with mouse and keyboard. The game is also compatible with controllers and joysticks. All controls can be remapped to your liking.

The game isn't very long. You can probably finish it in about 2 hours. I messed around a bit which lead to me spending close to 4 hours in the game. However, the game being short is definitely not a negative in this case. I think that overall the chill atmosphere and semi-challenging gameplay makes for a cozy experience on a rainy afternoon.

The game has some bugs in it, which is to be expected from a new release, especially one made by one developer and one 3D artist. Some of them have already been fixed in the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1685730/view/3719451786611878892] 1.0.1 hotfix [/url] that was released within a day of the launch.
Most of those bugs are and were extremely minor nuisances but nothing really game breaking. Most could be fixed by simply reloading the latest checkpoint, which the game has a good amount of, so you don't really lose much progress.

Cynthia comes across various collectibles throughout her journey, which offers some replayability should you have missed some. The ability to select and replay levels after completing the story would be a welcome addition, since there is no way to go back to get a collectible you might have missed other than starting a new game, which deletes your previous save.


What I didn't like as much was the dissonance between the character models. Cynthia, as the player character, has great quality model with physics and a neat selection of cool outfits to collect along her adventure. However, the other NPCs, while not looking too bad, are of noticeably lower quality than Cynthia. It makes sense to have the player be more refined than the NPCs we don't see as often and up-close too much, but it is still a bit jarring during cutscenes to go from Cynthia to an NPC.

The final boss fight was underwhelming and over before I knew it, I was hoping for a bit of a more elaborate final battle.
It sadly felt a bit rushed.

299,136575278,1685730,"Pros:
Great visual aesthetic
Fun (but not overly complicated) puzzles
Good use of stealth

Cons:
Couple of launch bugs (nothing game breaking and being addressed by the developer)
Voice acting of the boss felt out of place
Pressing a button after each loading segment annoyed me

Other notes:
Short game - about 3-4 hours to complete.
Cynthia's voice acting is fine by me, but to each their own. She is not as noticeably verbose after the initial chapter.

I would tell everyone wait until there's a final product before spending that much money for this.  Yes, lots of promise -- but its only a promise.

This one in particular seems to allow an absurd amount of customization in the way you link your weapons. It's really hard to explain in text and something that comes across better by just trying it out! Based on how you set up your links, your new upgrades can affect yourself, your enemies, your other weapons, or for example, your other weapons that proc off of hitting your other enemies, and so on and so forth (like an example - you can have a sword swinging from yourself, that inflicts poison on an enemy, that releases a nova burst every second, that inflicts a burn on enemies, which triggers something else to happen when it blows up, and so on).

Quite a ton of fun for the low low price. Definitely recommend if you're looking for something small to play around with between other things.",1

I'm really not know all about Deck building game so I can't pointing out on if this is a good game for that genre or not. But I can given you a detail on what you'll get on this game.

- Deck building game: Everything is card, Including you and you companions.
- On your journey you can pick a cards  to assisting in your journey, So don't worry, You'll have a lot of cards.
- Which also mean you have to building your own deck. The card consisted of Weapons, Companions and Equipments. Playing each card will subtracting a turn on both you and the enemies. Any card hit zero first get to hit first.
- So its basically a game of wits where you'll have to manage the card you'll play before your team gets to hit  the enemies turn by turn. And trust me, Its not that easy at all. and you are going to losing alot.......This is where Rouge lite elements come into play.

1. At the beginning of each match, You'll get to pick 1 out of 3 randomize heroes.  Each will have different hit point and Health point. Also some of them will come pack with the effect such as Barrage (Hit all enemies in the same row) etc. etc.

2. You'l die. ALOT. Which if you are able to complete certain objective on each match. You'll progressively unlocking the building on your starting point. Allow for better equipment, companion and pets (And more)

So basically, This game is best because you can swooshing in and out for a quick rush and just leave when you thing just gone down hill and coming back later for better tryout. Its really fun especially when you just want to have something casual and still feeling serious at same time.

Oh yeah, And the art is cute as hell. Probably a reason why I bought this game.",1

316,136577806,307950,"PSA: Must play for SOCOM fans.

I played about 150 hours in the standalone years ago. I decided that I should start playing again because now it's on Steam. They have done so many quality of life improvements that you new players can enjoy. The bullcrap system with the ""mobile game"" like daily where you send your operators to collect stuff is gone. There used to be so many currencies you had to grind and now the only basic silver & fragments is enough with the premium currency. Grinding operators to get better before was insanely boring, tedious and annoying. Now it's simple and much better. Straight line and you just spend the free to play currency to activate new talents. 

Graphics are good and so are about 80% of the legendary operator skins. There are few goofed up stuff but rest are some old school gear and then some tactic00l af stuff. Pick the operator you like, read what their skills do and enjoy. Store updates weekly that which operators are on discount. 

To all new players, please play the tutorial. I play medic 90% of the time so please, don't run away from me. If you need the heals, go to the medic or stay near the player and if the skill requires a chain or AoE don't leave it. Don't spend your syringes that much since medic can carry 6, save your one syringe when it all hits the fan. 

I never liked the PvP and never gonna play it. I just love to grind the simple PvE maps and modes. 

It's not perfect though, the new voice acting in some maps that are totally redone with ""story"" cutscenes etc. is so abysmal that you may want to mute your dialogs. It is just disgustingly bad. Some random voice actor doing stereotypically bad accents. Should have just stayed with the vanilla voices like in the old maps. There are also some really meta operators for PvE which are just hilariously OP and can carry the whole match. Bourbon is disgustingly OP as hell with Kit. 

It is a good free to play game and it is improving more and more. Glad they improved so many quality of life aspects needed in the game, the previous currency grind made me quit but now I can just casually play again and progress.",1

322,136576275,307950,"As someone who played this game from close Beta all I can say is stay away.
After playing this game for a long time, and having a peak in Super Test environment I can tell you, honestly that this team isn't competent  and they blatantly lie. For example this year was supposed to be without any new units, however, they need money again so they're adding two more. They increased the price of everything, just to milk people dry.
Their battlepasses were around 40 to 60 euros depending if you want to complete it fully, and the mod team would make fun of COD for having 10 dollar BPs that were cosmetic, while Caliber had literal pay to win collections for over 30 euros..

I was once harrassed and DDOSED by the people i played against, provided literal video footage, however ScumbagJuJu who is the lead moderator, shut me up and never said anything to the russian players that literally attacked me verbally and my hardware.
Another instance was where i was unrighfully banned by a moderator, where he promised a certain channel, then acted dumb and demanded i prove it or he will mute me for a certain amount of time, when i did prove it with a screenshot i asked him does he need more proof or will he stop  eating shit, which he promptly muted. Of course he was scolded by ScmubagJuJu because he was in no right to do so, yet he did. 

The player feedback isn't listen to, believe me, for four years we put up with their lack of balance and bullshit updates to avoid doing anything. They release a new unit, make it broken, literally pay to win, milk them for a few months and then somewhat nerf them.

I've played every game mode, I have a decent amount of earned premium skins and all opeartors [besides the new pay to win americans and chinese] a lot of time spent in game as well. 
Their rules are so bad, you can get banned, now let me repeat, you can loose your account, for Tbagging an enemy and or friendly. That was also one of the questions i was asked when they asked me for super testing "" How would i feel if someone tbagged me"" where i answered i'd find it funny, cuz it's all in good faith and gaming fun.

Whoever defends 1C with [pre or after wargaming era] is basically just sucking up to the devs, hoping for something, or is  literally coping. If you have money and time you may have fun, but nothing on the long run.",0

oh wait, there goes a random event and you lose 1 of each resource now and lose. again.

Tried clicking the feedback button and was just taken to their socials links.

Another standout feature was the warcamp, which was a unique and useful addition. It allowed me to manage resources, recruit new members, and interact with NPCs in a way that felt organic and immersive. I appreciated the option to choose between playing as a lawful character or embracing a more criminal lifestyle, which added a layer of moral complexity to the game.

But, as the versions progressed and the changes were made, it became worse. Today, probably hours away from release, it's... just another tRPG, I guess. With a couple interesting ideas and a number of annoying problems, just like most games.

The changes themselves are quite subtle. (sorry for long explanations, it's fairly intuitive when you actually play).
As an example, there is a very nice implementation of turn order: both your and your opponents' men are ""distributed evenly"" in the turn order for the round, so if the number of combatants is equal, you and enemy take turns acting with a single fighter, until all fighters act. However, for the AI, the order of its units acting is fixed, while you can act with any of your guys (who didn't act in this turn yet). While ""unfair"" towards the AI, it provides many interesting choices and tactics.
Now, if the enemy has twice as many people as you do, for each of your actions, they make two. So, even if you kill (or otherwise deal with) the guy who acts next (the obvious choice), another enemy will act after that and probably you'll be in some trouble. So, the difference in numbers turns out to be very, very important.
What did they change? Now, the number of your enemies is always quite close to yours, and in cases it somehow isn't, the extra units will arrive later (when you already killed many enemies) as reinforcements. So, the (rightfully dreaded) experience of being outnumbered is cut off from the game. Now, a lot of battles follow the same pattern: you neutralize the enemy who acts next, then he doesn't do much (or anything at all, if killed), rinse, repeat. A hundred of perfectly forgettable battles. 

I could write several such examples, including camp management, economy, fog mechanics. The early versions did convey the right experiences: you struggled to stay afloat with money, thoughtfully picked your contracts, took care of your men. But the updates made the game progressively worse. My best guess is, the game designers knew what they are doing and made bold (and really good!) decisions, but then some salespeople took over the game and made it ""accessible for wider audience"" or something - just another game.

UPD. The release actually happened while I was writing this. Congratulations! Despite all I wrote above, kudos for actually going all the way to the finished game, I know it's hard work.",0

It's a fantastic modern successor to the Turn based RPG games from my childhood, and I absolutely love it.

The developers are doing an excellent job of listening to the community and continually adding new content, which is very impressive. However, I have noticed lack of optimization issues with Nvidia, causing the game to stutter for few secs during your turn in combat. Playing in open GL mode reduces the problem, but I hope the developers add the Nvidia optimization to solve this issue.

There's so much going on in this game that I keep dumping long hours into it. Yeah, it's definitely not a fast paced game that everyone is going to enjoy. Some of the fights I've run into more early on in the game have taken long periods of time both in setup/strategy and because of the turn-based nature of the game. It'll take a couple of tries to get things right starting out and it's pretty easy to lose companions if you're not paying attention to everything that's going on.
Micromanaging your wages, food and companions' relationships is challenging and rewarding, making the overall hardcore feeling of the game much more appealing for players like me. Screw up positioning and lose your favorite archer, maybe save scum a few times to try finding a better starting position. There's a lot to soak up when you first start and there's definitely a bit of a learning curve, which makes it more entertaining and challenging.

Cannot wait to see where the game ends up going from here. Really enjoying what's there and I've only unlocked one other region so far, so there's plenty of stuff for me yet to do. I've tried a few groups so far and end up going back to the first one I created where I'm the furthest and in a definite money problem (though, I always forget to grab some prisoners - which is a pretty decent way to fund everything), sometimes a food issue, but my troop is getting stronger every time I sit down to rampantly play.",1

The fact that there is no initiative and any character can move when it's your turn (and vice versa for the enemy) feels silly. The starting positions in most fights also don't make a ton of sense to me. The talent trees are too shallow and it feels like some classes are much stronger than others. 

The 'campaign'/story is nice, but the battles become repetitive fairly quickly. I stopped playing sometime during the third region and haven't felt like picking it up again.

370,130153060,1527950,Yes,1
371,130149997,1527950,"The basic premise of the game is that you control a changing party of mercenaries and seek your fortune in a low-fantasy open world. As this is essentially the same premise as Battle Brothers, which I'm very familiar with, I'm going to compare the two in my review. I think a lot of people who will be interested in this newer game (still EA) will have already tried Battle Brothers, so such a comparison may be helpful to them.

Compared to BB, this game has a much greater sense of REALISM; every experience is more immersive. Instead of moving your party's icon across the map, you will see your group of members, complete with their beast(s) of burden and wagon(s), walking across the world itself. There are lots of points of interest in the world for you to interact with, including resource deposits to collect, groups of travelers of different factions, towns to visit, tombs to explore, etc. Most locations allow for you to search for things, sort of like a hidden object game. When you enter a town, there are multiple locations to visit, but they're a bit more involved than simply a menu with a list of options. Sometimes there are puzzles or quests involving multiple people, and in many cases you'll have to choose which faction to side with. Rather than hiring non-combat followers like BB, each of your companions can choose a profession which is very useful for the party as a whole; for example, you can designate someone to be a cook, which will enable them to cook recipes from food ingredients, and someone else to be a miner, allowing them to extract ore from mines. Most professions are associated with a mini-game; an angler has a little game in which you try to keep a fish on the line. The crafting system involves gathering resources from many sources: from town shops, from travelling merchants, from harvesting natural deposits, from skinning defeated animals; and then unlocking recipes that can be completed in your camp or in a dedicated workshop. The sheer number of things to do, and the way they all connect and benefit your team - it's a very impressive system. In terms of the fantasy element: if BB is a ""low"" fantasy world, this seems to be a ""lower"" fantasy world. If there is any sort of magic (beyond certain alchemy potions) or fantastic creatures (beyond a humongous rat) in this game, I have not discovered it yet.

GRAPHICALLY, the game outshines BB in every way. All people have full 3D models; all movements, battle skills, etc. are fully animated, and they're done so very well. I'm not knocking Battle Brothers here at all; it simply focuses on gameplay and doesn't endeavor to do a whole lot graphically, and people who enjoy it aren't looking to be wowed with graphics. That said, this game does, and uses the graphics for full immersion in a very impressive way.

The COMBAT is comparable to Battle Brothers, each having strengths and weaknesses. One of my favorite things about both games is that everybody can die. For real. For good. If you suck and let one of your guys die, they're dead. Gone. Bye bye. When I said your party is *changing*, that's what I meant: if you bite off more than you can chew, they'll be pushing up daisies in no time, and you'll have to recruit replacements. That said, combat in this game is *slightly* more forgiving, in that there's a mechanic applied to all your characters that essentially gives them the ""nine-lives"" perk from BB; that is, if they would be killed by a blow the first time, they survive it for a moment but will die for real if they take any more damage before they are healed. ""Healed"", meaning a realistic first aid skill that doesn't magically put them back to full health - it stops bleeding, burning, etc., and gives them a few hitpoints. A major difference between this game and BB is that battles are affected very little by RNG rolls; it rarely determines whether attacks hit or miss. (It does affect the order that enemies take their turns, as well as damage output for most skills.) Another major difference is that the tactical maps are not hex-based; they are based on realistic distances. Characters, depending on their movement ability, may be able to move up to, say, 10 meters. Positioning is very important, as different skills and weapons have different ranges (in meters). There are also natural hazards for certain tactical maps, such as falling rocks in caves, or lightning strikes during storms. (I actually find that these detract from the realism a bit, however, for two reasons: #1 in real life, they don't happen often enough to be a real factor in any battle of this size; #2, you get a preview of the AoE for these hazards before the turn, so you know exactly where and when they will occur, and you have plenty of time to get your guys out of the way.) In all, the combat feels very good in this game. I'm delighted to tell you that I screwed the pooch about 20 times before I finally figured out how to keep my guys alive.

Your COMPANIONS can be recruited from inns, from prisons, or other sources, such as solving a dilemma a certain way or completing a quest. You can also take prisoners and force them to do your bidding, including even taming most animals in the game and having them fight for you. Unlike BB, they have classes rather than backgrounds; the classes determine what options are available when they level up, so the customization doesn't feel quite as flexible as BB. You cannot equip any armor/weapon on any class. Only an Archer can use a bow, and he/she can't use anything else (that I'm aware of); in the event that they are forced into a melee attack, they can only use their fist to punch for a couple points' damage. The Ranger class is essentially a ""rogue"" from most RPG-type games. They can only wield a knife and an option off-hand weapon. I'm not sure why he's called a ""ranger"", as his primary weapon is not ranged and he doesn't really have any connection to nature or animals. As far as the uniqueness of characters' appearance, there are about 5 faces, 5 hairstyles, 5 beards, 5 hair colors, etc that you can choose from. So you can customize... just not a lot. However, companions can be either male or female, though I'm not sure of the full implications of this, or if it's simply an aesthetic choice. As you progress through the game, events can happen (like in BB) where characters acquire new traits or even promotions. When you hire someone, you don't know how exactly they will end up a month down the road.

PROCEDURAL GENERATION: This is the main area where BB triumphs over Wartales, as it has a fully generated, randomized world for each game. This is the main reason why I have over 4000 hours in it: it's hugely replayable. In comparison, the world of Wartales and most things in it were manually designed. RNG does affect some things from game to game, such as which items are available for sale at different locations, where/when some resources will appear, who will be travelling where and when, the order that quests will appear, etc. However, the world is otherwise a map of the same area from game to game. You can re-play the game with different characters, strategies, skills, and whatnot, and you can unlock different starting areas as you progress through the game; however, you will still be playing the same world, and you'll know all locations, stories, main quests, and decisions ahead of time, provided that you've discovered them before in an earlier playthrough. In my opinion, this is the only real drawback to this game compared with BB; but for me, it's a major one.

That said, this is a very fun, high-quality game with a ton of stuff to see and do and try out. What the developers set out to do, they have achieved remarkably. And it's still only Early Access - you can bet it's only going to get better as they continue to add more of the same.",1
372,130143807,1527950,"this is a hidden Gem! very good so far. it is essentially a top down rpg, you do have a party but move all as one unit on the map with shared inventory so you dont have to swap between inventories of party members. the world is explored top down crpg like diablo or Wasteland and when combat is engaged it plays turn based akin to divinity with cool kill animations, and some environmental things. its got a pretty in depth crafting system and each character can have a profession they can skill up at and craft better stuff. there is also fun mini games like fishing and armor crafting and based on performance in mini game is the quality of item. it does have difficulty scaling so you can customize it to meet the level you find fun both on survival and combat elements.  party management does not feel like a chore as you find contracts to get paid to pay your merc party and can find food in wild/ hunting fishing gathering. also you can find crafting materials in world for crafting gear and cooking food. camping is fun and intuitive. all in all im having a blast and i wish i picked it up sooner. if you like the idea of a free roam top down crpg with crafting and good turn based combat that is simple yet fun this could be your new best friend. have not ran into any stability issues yet and only one small bug that was not a hindrance in any way.",1

Ware tales however is just difficult. Don't get me wrong, i enjoy a game that seriously stresses my mind. I wait with anticipation for Frostpunk 2. However when a game artificially makes its setting difficult for the sake of being difficult, no thanks...
Number of points.
1 Game economics are terrible. You can tell the economic capability of a game like this based of the craft cost. A crafted item should generally be worth more than the base components that went into it. This can vary if there is a price change due to quantity in a market (not for Wartales). When i went over the general prices for many crafted items, about 1/3 to 1/2 are just straight out less cost effective than their base components. This is disheartening to see at the start of a game. I didn't even factor in the general cost of acquiring the items in terms of party upkeep. You can grind the game out and make progress with the system possibly. That was just a massive red flag for me right away.
2 Combat is completely unbalanced. I know, people with tell me that it was fine for them, just use strategy, or if you do it this certain way than its just fine. A game like this should reward you for thinking tactically, not demand it. I don't enjoy spending an abundant amount of time strategizing on each tedious fight. Also if you are fighting same level enemies as you, the general expectation is that their capabilities will be the same. If the enemy can do double my damage at the same level and class, that's an artificial difficulty adjustment for the sake of being difficult. I don't enjoy it, and i don't enjoy being given paltry rewards for it. At least one wound at least per encounter for me, costing me at least 20 in craft good cost for a medicine, reward worth about 15 or 20. Just disappointing after the effort.
3 The story is lost in the survival. Any semblance of story that you might come across gets lost in the desperation to simply survive. You will make decisions based on your current needs more than on your morals at the start. Maybe this is the tale they are trying to convey. That life looses meaning when you stop living and just survive. Well they are right and that, in the end, is why i didn't exactly enjoy this game. I play games to live, not simply survive.",0

60 hours into it and have only fully explored 2 of the 4 (5?) regions available until now, the other 2 are almost untouched, yes I'm taking my time to explore and grow my group but still, that's a lot of content and things to do in a EA game. I'll probably take another 60hours to finish all the content currently avaiable and wait anxiously for more. 

The combat is very in-depth and even in Normal it's a welcome challenge, a lot of factors to take into account because each and every encounter is different, different mini-bosses, deployment and so on. Every single fight I have to think about what I'm doing, if I rush in head on even on lower level encounter I can get a guy killed. 

There is a lot of skills and especializations in the game, each of them bring something new to the table and makes you adapt to each situation depending on the guys you have. Nice crafting system, altough the weapons and armours you can craft gets pretty old when you reach lvl 6 and start dropping higher level stuff. They are still very much useful nonetheless. 

The only complain I have is the pathing system in the world map, you get stuck a lot but it's ok. I wasn't expecting to be so hooked up on the game since is EA, but the devs made an awesome game so far. It's well worth the price if you ask me, ESPECIALLY because the devs are apparently keeping up with the roadmap with almost no delays.

Wartales is a turn-based combat (XCom style) squad RPG, with a solid amount of content, interesting storylines, fun and challenging gameplay.  Unfortunately, there are still several bugs that range from mildly annoying to game-breaking.  By far the worst (at least on my system) is the chance to crash the entire computer upon entering any town marketplace (happens about 25% of the time), which also often corrupts both the auto-save and manual saves from that game.  I have one campaign 15 hours in, but due to that crash and save corruption, I can no longer play it.  Incredibly frustrating.

Wartales is very promising and I keep coming back to it (avoiding marketplaces as much as possible) despite the ongoing problems.  Once those are sorted out and the game is refined further, I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes one of my favorites.",1

It's the classic formula of ""build up a group of mercenaries"", where you do quests, earn money, recruit more mercs and make them stronger, then use that to complete harder quests. Other games that I'd compare it to are Battle Brothers and Mount&Blade.

It's not quite finished yet, and this is especially noticeable in UI/UX, some content, and balancing. However, the core systems are all there and really fun. Research and crafting is really cool, and the various progress systems (Comprendium, research, ...) are amazing in a game of this genre. Haven't encountered any bugs or crashes either.

Uninstalling and will wait a year to see how it improves.

437,109836280,1527950,"Hm...  42hrs in my first playthru.  

42hrs in the first area alone.  
I felt like with the EA, I hit the limit with my team too quickly.  Got the hang of the whole, fight, run home, repair, eat, fight, run home, repair, eat, etc. fairly quickly.

As ambitious the concept of Wartales sounds like, I couldn't really feel emotionally attached to my team/character as I would in games like Kenshi, Mount & Blade, Crusader Kings, etc.  I didn't really feel attached to the mini-stories around the area as well.  I was excited to play the story of farmers wanting more with life but once I started playing, it felt like your backstory has nothing to do with how you play or how it dictates the world.  A game title like ""Wartales"" feels like a ""Play the way you want to with the backstory you want"" type game.  But this is just purely, fight, loot, repair, eat, sleep, repeat.

Oh, uhm.. once I figured out how to effectively and efficiently craft items for trade, it added an additional 10hrs of gameplay of renewed excitement realizing I could make more money by crafting from random loot and selling the crafted items. But then I hit my limit again once I managed to consistently stay over 1000 gold or so.

After all that and completing the first area and moving to the second, I felt like I hit a wall to play this game as it felt it's a rinse and repeat regardless of the region you're in or the background of your team.

Overall, this EA reminds me of other EAs I played where I play for a solid week or two and then hit a hard stop for many years as it just didn't feel wholesome or satisfying.  I guess I'll keep TRYING to play a bit more to see what else I can uncover..

I don't really thumbs down games but would definitely give this game a ""MEH"" for now.
Maybe other users have a more fulfilling and exhilarating experience instead?

Instead of thinking they cant switch, OFC the ability to move your fighters around is obvious but personally i didnt know you could switch fighters at will at the start of combat AND during combat aslong as they havent spent their action. Until i had played the game for a little while. Personally i think there should be a more "" DND "" aspect to the game where the initiative during combat will be based on skill ""and/or dice"" if you decide to implement that in the game.

Running on the world map should be a basic skill that you shouldnt have to spend points on in my opinion, because the fighters are grown ass men and women :P 

I also think that the cooking and the raw material production in camp should be increased to maybe 3 - 5 per rest, at least for a time when you start the game. 

Some paths in the game / on the world map, was pretty wierd to be honest :P

 SPOILERS AHEAD !!!! 

When you go on the mission to kill the colonel alex or (insert name). There should be a tutorial or atleast a hint that the player can plant a piton from their inventory manually. 

Also the mission to go into the ancient tomb or crypt, I only found the path to the place because i saw some random NPC's running in a wierd way down the hill :P but the torch ""preperation hint"" was good :) 

All in all, thats my look at the game so far, i like it and i hope it has a bright future :)

449,107194722,1527950,"I buy a few new games this time of year, the sales, but this one deserves mention. It's stand out in many ways, it's a survival sim, as well as very immersive RPG. You are a band of deserters, bandits with the potential to become unwanted...or ??, or just some farm boys out for fun, that's just 3 of the 5 starting bands of 4. In the end you are mercs or bandits, or a trader, you can even be a cannibal with a pack of hogs you feed instead of regular folks. The game is very open, with lots of side quests, so much so that I don't want to spoil it as it's so new and so many are finding new ways to survive and explore. The devs also have a strong rep, and have produced some very good games, so looking forward to more content. Right now there are 3 provinces I have found,  trade is possible between them, but you will need to protect you goods. Another good money maker is bounty hunting, take prisoners and sell them, but there us a limit. The game is pretty well balanced and does not play like an EA at all, other than lacking voice actors it's pretty polished, the world is quite immersive with each province having it's own main story line....I think they all tie together, trade control seems to be a main motive? I have yet encounter any real bugs, though sometime I think i have, you can only sell bandits as prisoners...not the innocent folks you bash over the head and force into slavery because you are to cheap to buy another pony....but you will have to feed them. It's deep, and the turn based combat is too, like chess, skill and fore thought are required. in short BUY IT, best new game of the season. The only thing lacking is more provinces, and PvP, there is already an arena you can fight NPCs in so really hoping that becomes a PvP thing...with a full loot option of course, maybe even some Pvp provinces?

456,105782346,1527950,"BLUF: too expensive for what is offering right now, Will come back to this review once there are enough updates to have mid and late game content.

EDIT: Tutorial and tooltips have been added in the Comunity patch for December 2021. Once the autoleveling is addressed too, they will have my thumbsup

It's true. You currently have a lot of gameplay due the big map it already includes. You will really enjoy the early game once you have finished struggling figuring out how everything works, because it's not only there is no tutorial at all, it's that they have not even included tooltips or explanations for all the minigames involving crafting. 

And this is one of the cons I see in this game. It doesn't give you any feedback, you don't know any details about the character classes, which weapons they may use or what abilities will be unlocked when promoting one of your companions to captain or lieutenant. First times you promote someone it’s a guess game adventure, like getting a new crafting recipe for a weapon (no, brutes can’t use axes… seriously?).

The other big reason to not recommend Wartale right now there is no mid or late game content. You can only advance until level 5 and, after that, your companions will randomly get skill points whenever they get a nickname (it may occur several times for the same one and, guess what, the game doesn’t explain why or when nicknames are earned or changed). The only thing that escalates the game is the autoleveling of all the enemies around, which is only useful to generate more of the same with the difference that you will get combats of half an hour or 1 hour instead of the aprox 15 minutes during the early game. Spending almost one hour fighting superboars over and over again in epic battles is not fun, it’s repetitive and boring.

Nevertheless, there are around 10-15 hours of early game quite enjoyable and fun (learning process included). You should do the math if that’s worth 35 € EA for you… But do it in advance, by the time you have learned the game and have passed the exciting first date and start facing reality (the repetition of endless battles), you will not be eligible for a steam refund anymore.

Review : 10/10",1
496,136603067,1527950,"This game is fantastic and I cannot rate it highly enough. I thin this is the first review I've ever written on steam, and I'm writing it for this because this is an awesome developer and I have loved playing it. I started playing at the beginning of early access and have (so far) put ~200 hours into it.  

This is a thoughtful, and well constructed game. Lots of role playing opportunities and great replay opportunities. My only complaint WOULD have been that the end game becomes a bit too easy, as your troop becomes a bit overpowered, but in the release they have made some small adjustments to combat and so this should be (if you are looking for a challenge) a great turn-based strategy combat. 

The economics are great as well. 10/10 would recommend, and I've only had to kill and eat one of my group once...",1

501,136602512,1527950,"Fantastic Game! While it is not everything to everyone, it is certainly a great game if you like building characters and playing turn-based games. The story is ok, but you are not married to it, there are many ways to cross borders. If you are looking for a turn-based game while we all wait for BG3, this should hold you over for a minute.

504,136602665,2109430,"An excellent, short visual novel set in the TRON universe after the beautiful TRON Legacy. Though it only took me 3 hours to finish the game, I went back and got all the achievements in another 2 hours and thought my time was respected well. The graphics and music were beautiful and each of the characters had pretty believable motivations. The puzzle sections were also pretty cool and built up in difficulty organically. My only real complaint is that the game's story ends on a pretty open note, and it's just inconclusive enough that it feels a little unsatisfying. For 15 dollars though, this is absolutely worth your time.",1
505,136603336,1118110,The game is fun to play. Graphics could be better though.It seems like a game from 2015 compared to what graphics are like now. There is a bit of realism but for the most part i think its not the most realistic.  I would guess many of the bugs will be fixed and many improvements will come out in the next couple months. I would recommend the game and give it a chance.,1
506,136603177,1772830,"Rusted Moss is a charming game that oozes atmosphere, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But it has several problems. For a 20 euro game, it feels unpolished, like an early access title. I would honestly have preferred to pay 30 for a more polished version of this game.

The Bad:

First, the game is marketed as a twin-stick shooter. But booting the game up it told me to use mouse and keyboard, rather than controller. Using my PS4 controller, the game also doesn't show me correct button symbols, and does not let me bind certain controls to certain buttons (I have not tried using Steam's controller support for this game since many games reliably fail to show correct button symbols.)

Second, the game is marketed as a metroidvania. However, in playing it for six hours I found that the movement system, while rich and with a high skill ceiling, does not properly tutorialize several mechanics and does not properly encourage experimentation because of its difficulty. The level design does not adequately communicate which traversals are possible with the player's current skill set. With my disabilities, I found myself wondering which parts of the game I was 'allowed' to use the fly assist to bypass, and which I was supposed to be gated from entering for story progression reasons. Additionally, in six hours of playing and defeating three major bosses, I found a distressingly small amount of new abilities: the grapple, the high jump, a different gun, and grenades; there were plenty stat upgrades to be sure, but no genuine additions to the kit.

Third, the game is positively punishing in difficulty. This isn't a problem as such, but it is executed in frustrating fashion. The high-skill traversal system makes certain stretches between save points feel like unforgiving gauntlets, both because of the platforming and the enemy ecounters. This is exacerbated greatly by the fact that all progress since last save is lost upon death: all rooms explored, all collectibles found, all lost upon death. For certain collectibles, this made it harrowing to return to a save point.

Fourth, the combat system feels less than fun. The guns have great sound design and interesting firing modes, but the range is so short it feels like artificial difficulty. Since movement is so high-skill as well, this eliminates the greatest advantage the player would otherwise have: positioning. It makes regular enemy encounters feel like a hazard to avoid, in a game that hands the player a machine gun in the first ten seconds. Also the fact that grenades and healing use the same resource just serves to punish the player and disincentivize using the weapons available.

Fifth, there's a couple of minor annoyances. Mostly there are no genuine secrets to find, hidden walls and the like; but I have managed to find at least one instance of a genuinely hidden item close to the starting area, which felt very out of place. It is also possible to unintentionally skip non-repeatable dialogue, and there's no log of previous conversations to review in case that happens. For a game with such a detailed assist menu, it feels rather patronizing that the only option for circumventing platforming troubles is straight up flight; extra grapples in the air would have been a welcome addition, again like Celeste. Also the auto aim just plainly doesn't work.

The Good:

First, the writing. The character dialogue is execellent and genuinely funny. The worldbuilding is compelling and the story isn't front-loaded. Fern and Puck have a pre-established dynamic, and the story begins in medias res after an apocalyptic event, the details of which the player has to uncover. It is a refreshing work of fiction. (The only thing that frustrates me is how the grim tone clashes with the fact that the bosses are mostly left alive and hale for some reason. Would to me make more sense if they died in the battle, or at least were shown to be injured in some way in the aftermath, but that's a nitpick.)

Second, the aesthetic presentation. The graphics are gorgeous, the pixel animation style is well executed and feels nostalgically retro in all the right ways. I am in particular smitten with how each biome has a distinct color tint to the menu; very atmospheric. The animations are solid, the character design is varied and interesting, and the enemy variety is diverse despite all of them being machines. It reminds me of other great works such as Risk of Rain and Hyper Light Drifter.

Third, the music is wonderful. It sets the mood of each area without being intrusive, and it is definitely worth buying the OST download if you like listening to video game soundtracks.

Conclusion:

Rusted Moss is a action-horror platformer with exploration focus. It sets the player up against armies of enemies that the arsenal does not adequately address, and rewards avoiding combat and conserving resources more so than proficient combat. The story is dark, bleak, and apocalyptic, with the player fighting on the side of an inhuman, callously uncaring evil. It struggles with gameplay, but excels in story and visuals.

507,136601816,2109430,"It is a VN with puzzle elements. 
Loved Tron as a kid, have not kept up with any lore since the Legacy movie and felt lost a couple times with some of the language but it didn't effect my enjoyment of the game. My first playthrough was maybe 2 hours so it is a short game, however it is the brevity of the game that makes it likely I will replay to try and get a different ending (since choices I may have made contributed to a few too many deaths ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).
Music is good, graphics are Tronish and the story is a standard detective tale. Not entirely sure on how I feel about the puzzles, at first they didn't make sense but by the end they were pretty simple.
I think it was worth the $22 loonies it cost me but I can very much see how others will see it as overpriced. 
Played perfectly on the Steamdeck which is a perfect home for these types of games.

509,136603277,1811990,"A wonderful mix of roguelite deck building with autobattler elements. The game is super easy to pick up but rather difficult to master. Cool deck archetypes that prompt the player to make meaningful decisions and to tactically place their units

and the art and music is just the most perfect cherry on top, mwah.

512,136601407,1893370,"So I'm split on this so far. I think this game is doing a lot that I really enjoy: the movement, guns (mostly), aesthetic, and music. 

But some things feel off:
- Mainly most of the maps I've played have felt really small for an arena based game, it often felt like I had way more movement than I needed for the scale of these areas. I know it wasn't an issue of movement because in the more open maps things felt fine. Side note for wall jumping: I think this feature is severely underused. I don't think there was a single instance where I felt that wall jumping would be useful or the better tech option over slide jumping. Just something to consider.
- Then there was the issue of the friendly AI: either the friendly AI is able to essentially play by itself (one flag CTF), or was pretty much useless (Control mode). I would find the AI just sitting in a corner doing nothing or bum rushing the objective and dying almost immediately. This forced me to have to essentially play both the role of offense and defense, though mainly defense. 
- The story thus far has been rough in its' presentation. Too much is thrown at you way too quickly, and my understanding of the world is nonexistent. Your character, Molly, literally spawns into the world and is immediately informed that she is some form of undead that has been brought back to life to compete in arena shooter style combat. Cool, great launch pad for some interesting cyberpunk/hackerman energy. But very quickly after your first clue that things are not what they seem, the story ramps up way too fast without any build up. You're introduced to a cast of character that you very quickly realize don't have a whole lot to do outside of being unique skins for the AI to use in combat. I got the sense that these characters  are supposed to be the main cast you're dealing with, but they have next to nothing to do or say - I just don't care about them. Only one of them gives off a memorable first impression and that's because you have to kill him in the arena. The story also introduces a character that further calls into question the things that have been going on, except the issue is that you haven't had a long enough time to actually see what things are normally like in this world to actually question what had been established. Going forward I would recommend that the story team be a little more patient with showing their hand. Just establish the world that Molly first spawns into: who brought her here, what is their reason, where is she, who are these other characters, what are the basic rules of this world? Let the player understand SOMETHING and have a reason to care about it before you try and subvert what you've established, or begin adding in stakes for characters that I don't have a reason to care about.
- This is my last issue, but it is related to story: the dialogue. It is often ROUGH. The tone is jovial and light, but it is entirely at odds with everything else. The humor is pretty shallow and frankly I wished it was toned down a lot. The dialogue between characters is pretty pointless. It gives you pretty much no extra information about the characters or the world. They seem entirely disconnected from everything going on around them.
- Final thing: The pistol feels off, I don't know if its damage or rate of fire (for either firing mode), but it felt wrong in comparison to every other weapon. Not a huge deal, maybe I just need more time with it. 

In conclusion: I like this game a lot. Playing the game was fun, and though the story hasn't impressed me, almost all of the elements they've introduced in the story are, or could be, really interesting. I have my issues but ultimately I want to see more. SO KEEP GOING DEVS! YOU GUYS HAVE SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL HERE :)

Its really fun and interesting.
Im at the story right now.
You basically do ""engine"" building. Which means investing resources for buildings to generate resources faster.
Thats necessary, to basically outbuild the waterflow, as your goal is to develop faster than the water can kill you.

What does it offer:
- Economy building
- Disasters
- Random Maps
- Pirate Attacks and Towers to defend from it
- Upgrades and randomized Perks you gain for research
- Several Builders with their own perks and abilities
- Unique Equipement you can unlock and select, which acts basically as a unique perk
- Several layers of construction including underground, in water and on artificial platforms.
- A solid story mode
- A Quickplay (Skirmish) Mode
- An Endless Mode
- Challenges in Story Mode
- Weather Conditions on your map affecting gameplay
- A solid soundtrack
- Active Pause",1

Back then it had less content and everything was more expensive, I also don't find this game Pay To Win as from what I've seen, everything (except for cosmetics) can be earned through gameplay and Cosmetics like Legendary skins are price fairly at $16.50 (or 3500 Premium Coins) when other game would ask for $20 or $25 for a skin. This game also looks Stunning for a Free to Play game, graphics looks crisp and I get no frame rate drops or screen tearing.
