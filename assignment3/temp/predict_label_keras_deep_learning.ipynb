       " 'What a great start by Pendopo Creations to take a debut step in a early Q2 2023. This game kinda remind me of Lacuna and Virtua Verse since those games look pretty similar. But, review is review so I\\'m gonna tell what I felt and experienced while playing this game. \\n\\nStart by the premise of story, Setyo starting to take a step in Bay City as a foreign agent and then as a security of a tech company. While his colleague, Jack, who works in Bureau appearing in Bay City and gave Setyo a bad news about the lost of his sister so it forced Setyo coming back to Neo-Surabaya and find some clues about his sister. All I can say, the plot is properly wrapped in a 6 chapters in total which makes the story more focused. The story doesn\\'t feel rushed at all. Plot is surprisingly attractive so the experience kinda similar as watching a movie. Besides that, the dialog is well written in english. So, from the story aspect, I could say this game is a have a great plot, not rushed, and a well-written dialog. \\n\\nFor Indonesian folks, trust me, some of the dialog is so much related to our culture and society nowadays. One of my favorite is while there\\'s a conversation talking about \"a department\" of a country that loved to block an access of one of a biggest game marketplace in a world.\\nStory: 8/10\\n\\nMove into the gameplay, this game, put it simply, is an action adventure game with a side-scrolling thingy like Lacuna and VirtuaVerse. The most important value that been delivered by dev to this game is at puzzle and combat mechanics. Puzzle mechs are variative which make this game has a bit of repetitive level. I\\'m sure that you\\'re not gonna get bored while facing all puzzles in every chapter on this game. Okay, let\\'s say some of them are stealth, hacking like a Watchdogs game, bunker code solving, making a key, \"stay calm while disguise\" with a rythm alike system, etc. There\\'s so much variation of puzzle so I can\\'t put it here all one by one. Besides puzzle thingy, this game also have a freedom for us to fight some foes with any weapon and a combat system. A combat system is quite okay, i think. One thing that annoyed me is just an energy and consumable items while in a fight. Energy drought so fast and consumable items a bit complicated since you need to open an inventory first and the consume the item. It will be better IF this game giving us a \"quick action button\" so we don\\'t need to try hard anymore. \\nGameplay: 7,5/10\\n\\nThe graphics is lovely jubbly. Imagine, the composition of 2.5D pixelated game combined with a proper lighting and synthwave colour tone is just right. It looks satisfying. This game is actually worth for some players who loves to see a pixelated or cyberpunk game themed. Give it a try!\\nGraphics: 8.5/10\\n\\nFinally, talking about sound/audio. All I can say is the background music is well delivered in any situation so the tense properly build up while playing the game. When we need to be relax, stressed, pressured, it\\'s all depicted good by a presence of a cyberpunk themed music. \\nSound: 7/10\\n\\nSo, in the end, the pros and cons of this game are\\nPros:\\n+Better plot, movie alike and doesn\\'t feel cheap. \\n+Puzzle mechs variative which makes the experience doesn\\'t feel bored.\\n+Dialog is well written, some of them talking about Indonesian culture and society issues\\n+Oooomagaaa, the graphics bro, beautiful. \\n+There is so many Indonesian thingy in a game like tukang sate, kang cilok, preman, pertunjukan seni, etc while the game is delivered to be fantasy futuristic. \\n\\nCons: \\n- Game still buggy and stuck at loading because of steam overlay. pro tip: don\\'t ever open a steam overlay while playing the game. Let\\'s hope the dev will fix it, asap.\\n- Combat system duh idk, all i want is a \"quick action button\" and some clarity improvement while in a stealth mission. \\n- Bahasa Indonesianya ga ada cookkk, semoga ntar ditambahin hehe, ksabar.\\n- There is no manual saving\\n\\nOverall, this game is at 7,75/10. Is this recommended? Yes, it is recommended. With this rate of price, you can get an experience of exploring to a deep down of an Indonesian greatest civilization with hi-tech thingy with a great story and puzzle mechs. Let\\'s go give em a try!\\n',\n",

       " \"I'm only 4 hours in but I wanted to say that I love this game. It's different from the other Frogwares Sherlock Holmes games in that you are solving one grand overarching mystery rather than individual cases, so I haven't had the experience of having to pick who I thought did it with what in that intense and wonderful way that the other games have, but the story that it is telling is so damn compelling that I don't care. I'm still finding clues and slowly piecing together what's happening, all while people are dying and crazy supernatural stuff is happening around me.\\n\\nThe juxtaposition of Lovecraft and Holmes works perfectly, the aesthetics combine well, and I love Holmes' analytical mind trying to work out why there's weird supernatural bullshit happening. I'm super excited to find out what is going on. \\n\\nOn the mechanical side, this game uses the same engine as Chapter One but adds some excellent quality of life improvements. For one, I think the open world was a detriment to Chapter One, and this one is much more linear which is good. For another you can click Z to have all of the interactable items pop up around you, which is an amazing thing to have in this sort of mystery adventure game.\\n\\nSpecial shoutout to the characterization, writing, and acting of Watson in this, he is so good.\\n\\nVery excited to continue, and congrats to Frogwares for a great game.\",\n",

       " \"Now let me get this out of the way. The game has potential. But right now it's very clearly unfinished. My first problem is there being no tutorial, thankfully somebody posted a guide explaining the basic mechanics. Apparently there's a flow mode and different characters have different things they specialize in (For example: More damage but you take more damage, stronger flow mode, etc.) But I didn't even realize this for the first 10 minutes since none of this is explained to you. Even the guide doesn't specify what character does what. Also, speaking of characters. Their designs for most of them are unfinished. One character looks like they got somebody else to draw smoothly. The rest though are hand drawn models that look like a deveant art OC. Hell, in actual matches there's not even the character model. Just a rough sketch with basic outlines. Now (In my opinion) the worst thing about this game is there's no online multiplayer. Sure you CAN play with friends. But that seems local only. It could be a 6/10 with the online multiplayers, but without it (including the rest of my points) it drops down to about a 4-5/10. Fix all these issues and you got a solid 7-8/10 rythm Game.\\nTLDR; Add a tutorial and online multiplayer, along with finishing the characters and you get a solid game.\",\n",
       " 'Rhythm Brawl is a laughably poor Guitar Hero ripoff with an adversarial bent as you play a 3 button rhythm game to some pretty craptastic music and wonder why Valve doesn\\'t have the quality control for Steam it so badly needs.  There\\'s a few different game modes and you can play PvP or vs the computer or just watch the computer play itself, this is convenient because while the computer is playing itself you can go find a pencil to rupture your eardrums so you don\\'t have to listen to the crap music anymore.  Very thoughtful of the developers there. \\n\\nThe nicest thing I can say about this is that it doesn\\'t use 2D retro pixel \"art\".  Unfortunately, instead, it uses some of the most eye gougingly bad high school art class dropout drawings (I won\\'t deign to call that scribbling \"art\") instead.  Like really bad.  Pixel art would be better, seriously, it\\'s atrocious.  The developers indicated they would replace it, but that hasn\\'t happened yet, so the game gets judged for what it is. \\n\\nThere\\'s no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There\\'s no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there\\'s no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There\\'s no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.\\n\\nSome of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the Godot game engine/toolset.  This is a very poor quality toolset sometimes used by amateur developers as it\\'s free (so they don\\'t have to pay for GameMaker Studio) and doesn\\'t require advanced game development skills, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities (it\\'s arguably worse than GameMaker Studio).  Just as you can\\'t make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can\\'t make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.\\n\\nThey\\'re seriously trying to charge money for this, $4 USD plus an eye watering $8 USD to unlock the rest of the game they haven\\'t finished (yeah, there\\'s DLC for an incomplete Early Access game, that\\'s not okay to the point of being unethical).  All that for a business model to try compete with Spotify by charging $12 USD for 6 crap songs on Steam.  Ugh.  If you play this game I recommend proactively seeing an oncologist afterwards.',\n",

I would love to change this review to a recommend.\\n\\nFirst off, A LOT of the art is unfinished. I'm of the belief that if you plan on making a commercial product, you HAVE to finish those kinds of assets beforehand. I understand this game is in Early Access, but this feels like an EARLY EARLY ACCESS. A would love to also see different character have different passive abilities and maybe an attack move that's different per character. More music would be awesome as well. \\n\\nAlong with this, online play would be huge for a game like this. My final thoughts are that if you add Steam Workshop this could be the defacto Rhythm Fighting game that people have been begging for. You have something special here. Please add Steam Workshop. Other than that, if the game fixes these issues, this will be an incredible game.\",\n",

The gameplay is bland and repetitive. \\n\\nI would not recommend this game if it were free to play. I wanted to quit after 30 minutes of gameplay. I went with my gut feelings to quit and do anything else. Maybe someone out there can play this game for longer than 30 minutes, but for my own sanity I will uninstall this game and never play it again.\\n\\n[b]Rate 3/10.[/b]\\n\\n[quote]Please note: I received a free Steam key through the Steam Curator Connect program.

This game is amazing. \\n\\nIt\\'s nuts and easily one of the better \"Vampire Survivor-likes\" out there. If you\\'re looking for a wild time where you spent a few minutes between rounds figuring out a ton of gimmicks to chain together to create utter nonsense before you fight again, this is for you. It\\'s more or less an \"engine building\" game, where one thing triggers another thing and efficiency buffs damage and things... Start off with a simple Spine and a tentacle gun, make it so that tentacle gun bursts into a giant skeleton blade on contact and poisons things. Use another brain to maybe build a function that connects all enemies who are poisons to be chains together by a death beam that saps their health for five seconds. Now do that for a default (for most prototype characters) for 8 total modules and level up to maybe 12, and up to four brains doing different things. Want to go summoner? Take a Queen and pick up every spawn thing you can, make them shoot instead of you or carry around debuff clouds. Want to machine gun things? Take a bunch of piercing tentacles and boxer nerves to trigger a lot of \"on hit do this\" commands. Don\\'t worry about committing to stuff... you can tear these structures all down and reuse your components or sell them off between fights. Also has a trial mode so you can test your crazy thing before you actually have to worry about dying. \\n\\nFreaking fantastic. Thoughtful, strange, and something to really make you think a bit to optimize. Only real complaint at the moment is enemies mostly just run at you at various speeds and take more or less damage. Feels like they\\'re just messing around to get all the node building right at the moment and maybe enemies become more interesting in the future. Still, worth it just to screw with.

The simple and bright artwork gives the game a friendly appearance, but after I headed into the main game, I quickly realized that it gives the player no quarter. There are 10 difficulty settings, and only two are unlocked in the very beginning. Well, so far, I have yet to unlock another. Please keep in mind that this game is in Early Access currently, and some of my discussion may be outdated by the time you are looking at the game.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\nThe idea is simple, you start off as a ship with a main and secondary weapon, all of your movements use your energy reserves that spontaneously regenerate, and every action has a cooldown. Enemies start coming after you in what almost seems like a survival arena and you need to fend them off until the boss encounter for that particular stage, after which you can complete the stage and move on or stay behind to gather some more resources, though with a finite absolute time limit. There\\'s a visual countdown to when things start going haywire if you stay too long, so it\\'s not difficult to gauge this.\\n\\nDuring your time spent on any level, finding local planets of various sizes and mining their resources will be very important. These resources are currency that you also get by killing enemies and you can upgrade your ship every time you reach a preset \"value.\" You need to be docked on a planet while you upgrade, and this isn\\'t difficult, you can run headfirst into a planet and that counts as docking.\\n\\nWhen you make an upgrade, you are given a choice from 3 random selections. You can gradually maximize your firepower, your abilities, your cooldowns, HP, etc. through your various upgrades. You can even increase how many selections you get when you upgrade. If you get lucky early on, you can take an upgrade to make it possible to upgrade mid-flight, which doesn\\'t seem like much, but is actually a huge boon. Or at least I think so.\\n\\nIn each level, you are constantly being hunted by the boss, which slowly approaches you from afar. You can see where it is and where you are, along with locations of the different planets on the minimap. It would seem that either avoiding the boss in the beginning or heading right in may each have its own benefits, I have yet to figure out the perfect strategy.\\n\\nThe individual runs in this game are usually pretty short. If I don\\'t have a good combination going for me from the first few upgrades, I find that I can rarely make it to or past the 2nd boss. With some nice upgrades working in nice synergy, I was able to get to what I thought to be the final boss on the easiest difficulty, though I still struggled to live to the end. I would say average runs for me when things are going well are around 15 minutes or so.\\n\\nThere is a lot of movement based on your momentum, and because you are a ship moving around in space, you can expect to have some arcing movements and annoying \"sliding-on-ice\" feel as you try to maneuver around. This is just something to get used to, it\\'s a game decision that will make a lot of people throw their hands in frustration but it\\'s a decision specifically for this game. Once you get used to it, it won\\'t feel so bad.\\n\\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\\nKeyboard and Mouse required, and for some reason I had to launch this on my laptop, since on my main PC, the keyboard was being recognized in the menu, but once the run started, it wouldn\\'t respond. I do hope that this gets hashed out and not too many people buy and need to refund due to unrecognized keyboard controls.\\n\\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\\nThe artwork in this game is nothing to write home about, everything is pretty simplistic in design. It has bright colors and simple designs that give it a bit more friendly appearance, but the game mechanics beg to differ.\\n\\n[h1]Music & Sounds[/h1]\\nThe music gets super repetitive, to the point that I had to turn it off\\n\\n[h1]Audience[/h1]\\nThis is where I struggle a bit. I would say more for people who don\\'t mind repetitive deaths and are okay with working through the initial slow bits in an arena-survival/shooter game. The run becomes more enjoyable when you can survive the initial start-up phase, which can be over quickly if things fall in nicely, but can also draw on for a while.\\n\\n[h1]Pricing[/h1]\\nEarly Access base price is $9.99 with regional pricing. It does have some replay value in that you are trying to chase the high-scores in kills during your runs while also trying to beat the game as fast as you can--the two leaderboards on Steam. I think the price is fair as far as people who enjoy the game are concerned. Those who cannot stand it have plenty of time to experience it prior to making a decision to refund, if truly they determine it\\'s not worthwhile.\\n\\n[h1]Personal Wishlist[/h1]\\n1. Have the issue fixed so I can play on my main computer, but the problem is that I have no idea what the issue is.\\n2. Having a bit simpler initial stages of each run when it comes to upgrades. I find that it\\'s the part I enjoy the least and it tends to drag on for a while, and for me that\\'s the do-or-die part of the run. If I make it, the rest of the run is enjoyable, if I die, then I have to start over from scratch and keep my fingers crossed.\\n3. More clear-cut synergy effects when upgrading, maybe showing some numbers/stats or highlighting which other prior upgrades will benefit, etc. It would be nice to know whether I am making a good decision or not when upgrading.\\n4. The mid-flight upgrade option comes up infrequently and I personally dislike the fact that I have to dock to upgrade prior to getting this. I almost wish the requirement to dock to upgrade would be removed completely.\\n5. More weapons/upgrade options, etc.\\n\\nBottom line in regards to this section is me saying that for these kinds of games to keep me interested, I need to see faster earlier progress to get to the fun parts, to keep me coming back and playing another run. It\\'s not difficult to start another run after the previous, but the desire to immediately start is definitely hindered by the knowledge of the beginning grind. It may be only a few minutes, but it\\'s enough to make me hesitate. With that and some additional QoL changes to facilitate smoother and more streamlined gameplay, I would enjoy it a lot more.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\n[i]Simple Sky[/i] is overall pretty fun, and so far I am enjoying myself. I realize that this game is in Early Access and so I hope to see some improvements in the aspects that I have requested, just to make it even more fun. I have confidence in that this developer will make the game better from its current build as there seems to be an update every time I look at it, especially with the latest one around a request that I had made.\\n\\nCurrent score 7/10 (written Oct. 9, 2021).\\n\\nThank you for reading.\\n\\n[quote]I received the product for free.

       " \"This game looks like a biopunk version of the recently saturated 'Vampire Survivors'-style swarm survivor roguelikes. However, the upgrade system separates this title above the rest. A deep, complex chain of inter-dependent limbs and organs allows nearly infinite permutations, each one visually represented on the player's character. This is the Hades of swarm survivors. It delivers far more entertainment value than it costs; I would happily pay $15+ for this much fun recombining abilities and seeing how they make my lil' mutant look.\",\n",

       " 'A short but very sweet return to the Tron universe. My first playthrough lasted just over 2 hours, and I was fully engrossed the whole time.

Slay the Spire, Dicey Dungeons, etc, they're fantastic, but bad luck can be extremely frustrating.\\n\\nI'm not having this problem with Wildfrost.\\n\\nNow obviously I've only played an hour so far, and I definitely haven't made much progress, but every time I've died so far, I've always felt like it's my fault in some way, whether I made a stupid decision or didn't prepare well, and even in the times when RNG has screwed me via lacking options for card synergy or in-battle junk, it still feels so much less frustrating than in other roguelike deckbuilders. I think this is partially because of the way the gameplay is structured; there's no obvious endpoint, just a continuing path, and you're not spammed with cards or the like. Every encounter keeps you incredibly invested with how you're strategizing, and even when you lose, the progression with the town can help you still feel as though you're making progress.\\n\\nIf you really want to try this game but aren't entirely sure, I'd say go for it.

       " \"Pretty neat platformer, controls are tight. Jumps are easy to make, and a good variety in stages. I'm going to lead with letting you know this game is very short, but it is enjoyable its entire duration.\\n\\n I think a good thing to do after beating all the levels and collecting all the 40 (? it was an even number I arrived at and I stopped seeing anymore) green coins is to try to beat all the levels with sub-one minute times. The levels feel like they're specifically engineered for this time frame in mind and it forces you to play creatively. \\n\\nI want to see this expanded into a larger game. I think the mechanics are polished and the understanding of how to implement platforming gimmicks is there. The dev is obviously very skilled at what they do. I think I got more than 3 dollars of fun out of this. I think an expansion on the concept should provide a purpose to the in game timer, such as beating a dev time or maybe a standalone collectable like the crash bandicoot games.\\n\\nThis is a ringing endorsement but I am going to post the few observances I have with the game after this, as well as my level times. (played with a controller)\\n\\ngood\\n+ All platforming is incredibly tight and telegraphed very well. \\n+ The little overworld is very fun to navigate however small it is. There is one out of the way place that immediately opens a warp after getting it and you can actually skip a few intended platforming parts using the core mechanics.\\n\\nneutral\\n= there is an acceleration you have with gliding, it feels like the opposite of what gliding would normally do. I consider this neutral because after you get used to it it feels very satisfying to move around, but there is a learning curve.\\n= physics with any moving stage gimmicks can be odd at times. It's consistent and you can actually use little things like leverage from spinning platforms to push yourself upwards a bit for more air but it may not do what you expect at first.\\n= In my opinion, I think the gold coins should be finite. It would give an easy third goal to the areas, and you can very easily afford everything even without the respawns. being able to grind it feels like I didn't earn it. I don't know how much I can criticize the economy in a 3d platformer though. \\n\\nbad (these are really really minor issues)\\n- recovery from a dive seems inconsistent. Sometimes I can recover and other times I feel like I can't and go barreling off the edge. This feels intentional but I couldn't get a feel for what triggered specific reactions.\\n- The camera snap during the sections where you're repeatedly hitting boosts is a little jarring. This only happens once or twice.\\n- I would like a little page in the menu that tells you all the information from the levels you completed. this is small but would be important for a larger game.

Set in a wasteland once inhabited by humans, this game provides a challenging and immersive experience that allows users to feel in complete control of their character.\\n\\n[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]\\n\\nThe game's twin-stick shooter aspect emphasizes tight and precise gunplay, with players quickly switching between their arsenal of weapons to best suit their playstyle and situation. Players can get up close and personal with a shotgun before grappling away and pulling out a sniper for the killing blow.\\n\\nThe grappling hook is the standout feature of the game, which takes some time to learn but is ultimately rewarding to master. The physics-based elastic grappling hook allows players to latch onto any moss-covered structure and swing their way through the rugged terrain. The freedom created by the controls creates a smooth experience, allowing for creative solutions to flexible traversal challenges.\\n\\nThe game offers a challenging experience, with powerful witches and machine monstrosities as the bosses. Each boss fight throws its own unique challenge at the player, requiring them to push their gunplay and grappling hook skills to their limits. Players must dodge swords, avoid energy fields, and blast away at conjured spiders to progress.\\n\\nThe game features beautifully melancholic pixel art with a retro vibe and modern aesthetic, bringing the world of Rusted Moss to life with moody pixels and stylish animation. The game also offers customizable strategy and gameplay, multiple endings, and encounters with humans and fae folk who are trying to find their way through the world.\\n\\n[h1][b][3] Verdict [/b][/h1]\\nIn conclusion, Rusted Moss is a fantastic metroidvania game that provides a challenging and immersive experience with its physics-based grapple, twin-stick shooter gameplay, and engaging story. The game's pixel art and aesthetic add to the overall experience, making it a must-play for fans of the genre.\\n\\n[h1][b]Side Note : [/b][/h1]\\n[code]Looking for nice STEAM games?

The game can sometimes not be very friendly with new players I'm gonna be honest and adding the shatter system on top of that can definitely ruin a players experience if they just want to play all of the levels for fun, but for people who want a challenge will most likely enjoy it. I've mostly spent my time on the editor on this game, but the main levels are really fun to play and the challenge level have cool mechanics that challenge your skill in unique and different ways. The easy and normal levels sometimes can feel lackluster, boring, slow, empty, etc. The advanced and expert levels can give you the real fun of the game. (though sometimes they're a big difficulty jump from their easier counterparts.)\\n\\nOverall If you're really into bullet hell, this game is a must have. It's really fun and its tracks are absolute bangers.\",\n",

Let's just say that the story is quite basic and that your overall goal is to change your destiny.\\n\\nThe game plays like any other action/platformer. You can jump, scale walls, and attack. You immediately realize that the stamina system is involved in all actions, which is fine when done correctly and just for certain acts. However, in this game it’s highly aggravating because jumping also depletes your stamina. Platformers require a lot of jumping, thus you'll spend most of your time waiting for it to fully recharge before making a jump. Then wait once again on the following platform. And again.\\n\\nThe same goes for combat. Each battle becomes a chore due to the very slow recharge. You're moving around wasting a lot of your stamina trying to gather enough for just one hit. When you have enough experience points, you can increase your stats, but you must first kill enemies who use a totally absurd mechanic.\\n\\nEnemies are brainless. They will follow you anywhere you go if you are in their line of sight, including across ledges, into pits, under spikes, etc. It is usually simpler to lure them into traps, which kill them and leave their corpse hovering in the air.\\n\\nThe game goes with old-school style of progress, which means linear path and no option to revisit stages. Even if stages include numerous paths and secret spots with gold and treasure, it's difficult to collect everything because it's so easy to die. Furthermore, if you just head for the exit, you can make things much tougher for yourself because each coin and experience point is valuable.\\n\\nThe overall difficulty of the game was the final straw that broke my back. There are traps everywhere, coming out of nowhere and taking cheap shots at you. Even if you survive falling into a hole, you most likely won't have the strength to climb out.\\n\\nWhat makes this even more annoying is the lack of checkpoints. If you die, everything you collect is lost and entire progress reset. Any kind of exploration is entirely discouraged because you don’t want to spend time by carefully navigating the stage, collecting everything you can and then get killed by a stray arrow. \\n\",\n",

If you're like me and you're desperate for anything remotely good in VR, this will not suit your needs more than likely. Unless you and a friend are okay with wasting money on a thing you'll probably play for 20 minutes, then, I don't recommend this game. \\n\\nThe physics is... fine? It's better than most other VR titles, and the full body part is the best aspect of it. However, meleeing with anything feels very bad, there's no sense of impact or collision. You can stick things to other things and make weird things, so in that way it's like GMOD but with like 3 tools. Gun, flight, and sticking things to other things. In it's current shape it's not worth the price of admission, and I couldn't convince any of my friends to get this game, so this is a review from the perspective of someone who put more hours than I'm willing to admit into single player GMOD. \\n\\nThe interaction spheres appear under alarmingly specific circumstances, the gun interactions are bad/very inconsistent. Even holding things seems wonky, since I picked up two things with one hand, which I don't believe was intentional, because when I dropped both one permanently was stuck to my interaction button, so if I tried to take a mag out of my pocket, it would send me flying toward the corner of the map, since the 'jet' thing was still bound to my hand despite clipping into the ground never to be found again. I experienced this bug within like 15 minutes of play, and it happened to *both* of my hands. It seems like too big of an oversight. \\n\\nThat being said, if this game got workshop support, fixed their interactions, upgraded melee, and allowed people to make some mini-levels to coop through with your friends (puzzles, combat, etc) or even had a miniture proof of concept coop campaign or even a wave mode, this game might begin to be worth your time and money. I went in with pretty low expectations, and even those weren't met. \\n\\nI'm not the biggest fan of Boneworks/Bonelab, but this game needs a few more months of [b]core changes[/b] to come even remotely close to the level of physics and interaction those games achieve. I understand this is likely a much smaller dev team with far fewer resources, but there's a lot left on the table for them to address. I hope it gets there, I do, and I'll be watching this game for updates, I'll try to re-review as more things get pushed out. Best of luck to the Devs.\",\n",

Throughout the levels, our goblin collects scattered coins which can be spent on upgrades, such as the beloved double-jump. Cleared levels can be replayed at any time, allowing him to access previously unreachable areas with his newfound abilities. For those seeking an extra challenge, the game can be completed without any upgrades, with an achievement as a reward. From time to time the goblin will encounter bosses, which, although easier compared to the levels themselves, are creative and add a nice variety to the gameplay.\\n\\nAn interesting aspect of the game is that all the sound effects are created using the developer\\'s voice, which may initially feel unusual and take some time to get used to. Some players may find it awkward or irritating. However, it\\'s worth noting that the game was made by one person, and this unique approach to sound effects adds to its overall \"hand-crafted\" feel.\\n\\nIt\\'s impossible to die completely in this game. When all continues are lost, the goblin is sent to the Underworld level with infinite attempts (after all, you can\\'t die when you\\'re already dead), and clearing it resurrects him with 15 extra continues. This process can be repeated indefinitely, ensuring that the player won\\'t lose all of their progress and have to start over.

       " 'Ok, here we go (been waiting for this since 2019)\\n\\nRemember Ghost Recon phantoms?

You have time? Dont mind a grind? GO FOR IT!!!\\n....and yeah, learn Russian!',\n",

       " 'Lightracer Spark is a visual novel set in a Sci-Fi world. It\\'s pretty much a narrative game where your choices matter as you progress through story. There are also some strategy elements, such as building various buildings, collecting resources, implementing space stations modules etc. I have to say that this game really surprised me how well made it is. \\n\\nStory/Narrative:\\n\\nI have to say that story is quite well written and everything is connected with each other. There is a lot of text to read, a lot of choices to make. Currently you can only play Chapter 1 (new chapters will come as DLCs) that has many mini chapters in it, and as you progress the story, you\\'re able to learn a lot about who you are, what is your mission and what you\\'re capable of doing. Prologue is some sort of Tutorial that shows you and teaches you how to play the game. The other chapters are specific stories that tell you about certain events. Now, the biggest pat of this game is that as Amender (controller of planets and universes) you have specific traits that influence the story. You can pick between 5 different paths and each brings unique traits and bonuses. In the story there will be some choices that you can complete and they have difficulty, ranging from very easy to very difficult. They do somewhat influence the story as it makes you get different ending and you don\\'t collect all the information needed but the higher traits you have, the easier it is to complete them. For example, you\\'ll have to talk about history of certain civilization and to complete that choice, you\\'ll need decent knowledge on \"Strange Worlds\" that is a specific trait in the game. All in all, I have to stay that story is quite unique and it does get you hooked but I just wish that developers added the button that you can speed up the text since most of the time you yourself have to click Continue in order to progress through story and text is quite slow which leaves you enough time to read everything.\\n\\nStrategy elements:\\n\\nI personally think strategy elements don\\'t influence the game that much. Yes, you have to collect resources such as energy points, technology points and population in order to complete some chapters, but at the same, you collect those quite fast and buildings are quite cheap to build. You can also upgrade them which allows you to gain resources faster. There are special buildings that do require some effort to build, and they bring you various bonuses and materials that are later required to build certain buildings. In general, it\\'s not time consuming but you\\'ll sometimes forget that they even exist or forget to upgrade them since you\\'re mostly focused on the story. There is also war in this game. I personally think it\\'s quite unfair for other provinces and countries to get attacked by you. Because you\\'re technologically stronger and the higher population you have, the easier it is to recruit troops. Enemies are quite easy to kill and they won\\'t pose a threat. I think it\\'s more beneficial to just focus on your military rater than pure resources. \\n\\nIssues:\\n\\nEven though the story is quite well written, music and images are well made, I can\\'t suggest this game for everyone. First of all, the mechanics of the game are quite easy to master and the game doesn\\'t offer much content. Yes this is visual novel, but at the same time developers could have given us something more unique to do in between the stories and the stories progress way toooo fast. As soon as you\\'re done with one mini chapter, you can instantly go to the other. As I already mentioned, building and waging war isn\\'t anything special and it really doesn\\'t bring you much. Time in the game can be slowed down or fastened up. If you have enough time to read through chapters and chapters of the story and you really do like to immerse yourself in futuristic world where AI helps you with everything, then surely this game is for you.  \\n\\nOverall score: 7.5',\n",

       " 'I\\'ll preface this by saying, it\\'s still very early, and this is just one episode, but here are my impressions so far.\\n1.  There are really no options.  You have one woman to impress and god forbid you choose wrong in one of the options you have, she\\'ll friendzone you.  If you didn\\'t find her attractive (and I really didn\\'t--she was too heavy for my taste), then too bad.  She\\'s the only choice in the game so far.\\n2.  No roll back.  Did you hit one of the choices accidentally?  Too bad. Replay the entire thing, or create tons of saves as you go.\\n3.  This next one goes towards the \"dating sim\" aspect.  If the one woman pisses you off (which she did), there\\'s no option to tell her to go **** herself and walk off.  You\\'re forced to be nice.  I would really have liked a \"b*tch, I have enough friends\" option.  I\\'ve never let a woman friendzone me IRL, and I certainly don\\'t want to do it in a game.  There\\'s great satisfaction in ghosting women like that.\\n4.  I suppose because it was by the same people that did College Kings, I was expecting at least the chance to have some good, meaningless sex.  That was not to be the case.  I suppose this game is G rated, or PG at best.  My hope is that the more episodes that come out, the more this will change.  I can \"not have sex\" with as many women as I want IRL. There\\'s no need to go to a game to do it.\\n5.  I both understand and enjoy the necessity to build up to a relationship.  It was my favorite part about games like BaD and College Kings, but both of those games gave you significant feedback when you did something that would cause a girl to friendzone you, or not like you, or whatever, and you weren\\'t friendzoned... you were merely \"in progress\" and the girls kind of let you know that.  In this episode, I got friendzoned and had no idea why.  None.\\n\\nAgain, however, this is all after just one episode.  Perhaps there\\'s still hope and I do look forward to the upcoming episodes, but the lack of a rollback option is just AWFUL!  If you want to add an \"ironman\" mode where you can\\'t rollback, by all means, do so.  I generally do my first playthrough keeping as true to how I would personally answer as I can and some kind of ironman mode for that would be fine, but to force everyone to play that way every time is absurd.\\n\\nTLDR: As far as the final recommendation, I\\'m going to say for those seeking an AVN, this isn\\'t it.  This is a teenage visual novel at best... no adult content whatsoever.  The dialogue is fun, even funny at points, but in it\\'s current 1 episode state, I can\\'t in good conscience, recommend it in its current state.  I will update the review as new episodes are released.',\n",

Soon you notice the ability of creating more squares of terrain around you, and do so to expand the world map itself. There’s no story or lore to speak of, other than you have to survive in the wilderness by any means necessary, as the night is dangerous, while the day is peaceful.\\n\\n As much as sandbox games can be far from being story-oriented, the complete absence of any narrative element is a strong malus when there isn’t enough variety to compensate for it. The world itself is composed of tiles belonging to various biomes, each has a colorful and vibrant palette, but also feels static; there are no changes in the weather, and no interactions between confining climates or between animals, monsters and plants. Like a diorama with a few moving parts.\\n\\n[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]\\nYou’ll explore the world you yourself create on foot, or later on via mounted animals. Speaking of expansion, each new day will have you choose some “cards” belonging to different biomes, to then place them as tiles to expand the map. Each climate has different animals and resources, so varying the composition is fundamental to access all materials for crafting. \\n\\nThe sense of discovery typical of an open-world survival is largely lost and washed-out, as even after many days the explorable world, including the underground level and the “enchanted dimension”, all matching in size, will still be small in size. You won’t even need a map for orienteering, and there isn’t one. As you roam these tiny expanses, you won’t witness interesting random events, rare spawns or other points of interest spawning at any point. The best you’ll get are goblin traders that you can shelter and house in your base, or animals to kill or capture and breed. The interest wanes after only a couple of hours, as you’ll have seen everything by then.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960459835\\n\\n[h3]Combat System[/h3]\\nAt night, monsters will spawn on any non-player made tile. The inside of your (hopefully) walled base is safe, but outside the hordes are relentless. Enemies vary per biome: for instance the ice biome will have evil snowmen, the underground caves have explosive spiders, and the enchanted dimension have floating, energy-shooting abominations. The way to defeat each foe  is always the same: kite them in a circle and keep slashing in melee, or wait between shooting patterns for ranged enemies. All of them have one attack pattern and follow mostly the same archetype, with minimal variations.\\n\\nYour choice of weapons is limited to swords, throwing spears or, if you grind trader reputation enough, slings. Each of them has a single attack, with the sling capable of flinging various crystals and bombs as an exception. Enemies become repetitive and stale not after long, while the combat system simply doesn’t have the depth to keep being engaging. No armors, accessories, upgrades, unique weapons and so on are present at any point. Blocking? Parry? Dodge? Anything? Nah, forget it. Minecraft’s combat system is Dark Souls in comparison to Miniland Adventures.\\n\\n[h3]Crafting & Base Building[/h3]\\nYou’ll use four main workbenches to get anything done, from flooring to utility buildings, weapons and furniture. The crafting system is the typical one of any open-world survival, requiring you to have a certain amount of basic and processed materials to make a finished product. \\n\\nThere’s no further elaboration or novelty to it. The economy is kinda broken, to the point I never used anything else than stone tools and Ruby (like Minecraft’s diamond) swords, as metal tools lasted too short compared to the effort to grind the materials to make new ones. Expect to take some time to have a spacious base with all the bells and whistles, even if most craftables are purely decorative or gimmicky - you won’t need them, unless you want to upgrade trader reputation by placing them in their rooms, which isn’t worth it anyway.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960460780\\n\\n[h3]Trading & Farming[/h3]\\nTraders offer wares locked behind reputation tiers, gained by furnishing their rooms in specific ways. Some of these items can’t be obtained in any other way, however none of them is really worth the effort. The system exists and is even a decent concept, but has no incentive to be used. \\n\\nFarming works in a classic way: plant crops, water them daily or use an automated sprinkler, reap the fully-grown produce and repeat. Of course, some plants may only grow in certain soils or biomes, while animals won’t need care but eat specific vegetables to breed and have more to harvest, like sheep for wool to make an example.',\n",

       " 'This year has been a great period for horror game remakes between Dead Space and RE4, and now even Frogwares seems to be getting on board that train. If you aren\\'t familiar with the older games in this series (like the one this is a remake of), you should know that despite this sharing a lot of the DNA of Chapter One, it isn\\'t an open world game. There are a few small hub areas with occasional small diversions, and if you get the side quest dlc there\\'s some side stuff to do throughout the first half of the game, but for the most part it\\'s more like a traditional point-and-click adventure game campaign (which I consider a substantial plus, considering how poorly their attempts at open world games went). It\\'s adjusted to be less inventory focused in favor of more of the modern investigation gameplay, but the main campaign is essentially one big \"case\", and it took me around 11 hours to get through everything. \\n\\nIts adherence to the original material comes as a slight detriment in some parts, because the pacing around the middle of the game was kind of a mess back then and to some extent it still is here, but a lot has been done to tidy things up and smooth over the rough edges. The writing is all around improved, the tone is more consistent across the board, and the story and puzzles have been changed up for the better. And compared to Chapter One, it\\'s honestly just really nice to have Watson back again; I went into their previous game with an open mind towards Jon, but he just didn\\'t have half the chemistry that these two have. There aren\\'t any of Chapter One\\'s unsolvable \"no right answer\" choices, and you never have to gun down a room full of enemies! It\\'s just a fun game all around for mystery fans, and while it\\'s not enough that I don\\'t still miss the Crimes & Punishments style of gameplay and deduction, it\\'s a level of compromise I\\'m happy to work with.\\n\\nThe original Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened was always a fairly substantial departure from what was normal for this series, injecting all sorts of horror and mysticism into the otherwise fairly grounded universe and then daring you to call it non-canon by bolting itself to the timeline with a single key plot element. I thought for sure that this would end up being more of a reimagining than a remake as a result, with it seeming to position itself as an official sequel to Chapter One, but it doesn\\'t -- if anything, it gets even weirder at some moments, and I wouldn\\'t have it any other way.',\n",
       " \"No, it's still not on the level of Crimes and Punishments. It appears Frogwares just doesnt effin get it. We want the games to be more like C&P NOT what came after it. The design mistakes of The Sinking City and Chapter One are still present though they seemed to have realized the eavesdropping and combat sucked so they have been removed. Once again, you are asked to make choices on guesswork since they could really go either way, things will not be visible because you werent on the right viewmode or were not highlighting the the right clue. Yes, the silly pinning mechanic is still here, and the game wants to be a sequel to Chapter One, constantly referencing it. Chapter One was a mistake that should be forgotten, not referenced multiple times within the first minutes. You already have a foundation to build on, it's called Crimes and Punishments. The mind map has been simplified yet again, and in a more frustrating way that tells you what kind of clues to select and how many, in a much less intuitive or interesting way than select posibilities enabling a logic train of thought like the one in C&P and TDD. The new Mind Map is also ripe for frustration and bruteforcing as you will frequently know what the answer is, just not what evidence it wants as the chain of thought that leads to it (a common problem of detective games), or you know onlt the logic train to an answer and it comes out of Sherlock's ass since the player could not have pieced the finan deduction from the clues. I'm supposed to BE Sherlock, not WATCH and nudge Sherlock. This is not a Watson game.\\nAlso, in that respect, the Imagination mechanic still solves the whole thing for you. You play a game of ordering very vague but still chronologically simple to follow events, but then Sherlock fills in all the blanks sometimes with plenty of information you didnt glean at all or couldnt be sure of. The character does the detective work instead of the player who gets to play a minigame and watch. Yaaaay.\\n And once again, side cases either dont get a mind map at all or get an even more simplified one.\\nOh, and in a cruel twist of UX, the archive is now accesed by looking at clues. I bet many returning players will try to access it by frantically pacing around the two inches of 221B you can move through repeatedly befroe realizing that. I'm beginning to think the game lacked playtesting.\\nI'll probably finish it as I'm out of other games but if you were hoping for a return to form, sorry, no. It seems whomever is in charge now plain and simply doesnt get the appeal of the best detective game they made, and has no interest in building on it. They like what I consider to be their worse games too much and will continue on the path they laid foward in them. Shame. Chapter One was a mistake and they are happy to keep making it. Fire whomever is in charge of CO and this pseudo remake and get the people in charge of C&P back on board for the next one.\\nP.S: Credit where credit is due, the game is really well optimized and while the animations are lacking, the character models for Sherlock and John are great.\",\n",
       " 'It starts off promising enough, but having played the full release, I just don\\'t know why you would play this over almost any other competent release in the new genre.\\n\\nThe graphics are neat, and there are a lot of interesting things presented - talents on level up that unlock a new set of talents, choosing your starting basic weapon, the watering thing is neat and the building stuff seems interesting. The problem is, you don\\'t get to interact with it at all. You choose from 4 options on level up, and that includes \"potions\" which are basically temporary buffs. The pool of talents is MASSIVE, and not weighted (as far as I can see). You get 2 rerolls per floor, which amounts to about 8 rerolls per run, which is basically useless for actually trying to do \"a build\". If you choose one of those \"class\" talents that unlock more options (mechanic, ki, etc.) it gets even worse.\\n\\nBasically all the choices are worthless because, like all these genre of games, you need synergy and multiplicative power to survive, which means just take the most basic, passive stat upgrades, and the basic fish summon skills, and do the same thing every run because everything else requires a staggering amount of luck in your favor to see work. \\n\\nYou can experiment on the lowest tier difficulty a bit but even then you\\'ll often just run into not killing stuff fast enough which means less xp which means less leveling which means killing stuff slower which means spending 5 minutes after the end of the level timer dodging endlessly while you whittle away the hp of the boss (or you could go onward and forsake even more xp). Oh also you obviously get WAY less rewards at the basic tier. Also unlocking higher tiers requires beating the previous tier, which means doing incrementally less forgiving runs over and over using the same builds over and over because anything else could mean wasting 15-20 minutes of your time and not knowing it until the choices keep failing to happen.\\n\\nThere is a fun game hidden here behind the insane lack of meaningful choices presented to the player. If the level up options were like, 8 choices instead of 4, it would STILL be more RNG than most of these games, but it might be more friendly to try out other builds.

You advance through randomly created floors, defeat enemies, gather coins to spend on better goods in shops, and open boxes with perks. Everything is lost upon death, with the exception of special keys and stat improvements.\\n\\nThe unique mechanic is the blue and yellow energy. Numerous things are connected to each energy, and you can change at will. Examples include opponents that can only be wounded with the appropriate energy and chests that open only with the matching color. \\n\\nAdditionally, some weapons and perks are energy-specific; they simply don’t work if you have the opposite energy. Fortunately, most enemies are in neutral energy, so you won\\'t have to continually switch during combat.\\n\\nThree keys are unique to each floor and are hidden in unique puzzle areas. These challenges disable your ability to switch between energies but give you doors that, after you pass through them, switch between the two colors. The goal is to push boxes and use doors to reach the final room with the key. \\n\\nYou keep these keys forever because they let you open unique chests that make subsequent runs a little bit simpler. But the most important is the puzzle room that gives you coins at the beginning of each run.\\n\\nThe reason you want to do that is that items are pricey. It\\'s nearly impossible to purchase anything just by eliminating enemies that randomly drop a chest of coins once you finish clearing out a room. While your starting gun has unlimited ammo, the short range and fun factor just isn’t there because you simply can’t afford a better gun at the start. \\n\\nThe game\\'s subject is time travel and experiments, therefore each \"floor\" is set in a different time period. Most enemies show up in all the stages, but there are still enough distinct ones to keep the game interesting. Four floors might not see much, but there’s enough content here to keep you busy for a while. A nice addition is a library that gets filled with all the weapons, enemies and perks you encounter.',\n",

Good concept but could be lacking longevity or replayability.\\n3. 3 different mines on the map and map is large although a lot of wasted space\\n\\nCons:\\n1. A lot of the controls are not really explained clear enough- especially when it comes to assigning haulers to diggers. Make sure you assign the hauler first then the digger or you will waste a ton of resources.\\n2. When it comes to the second and third mine- to load the cargo onto the barge or train- make sure you hit the Q and E key to open and close the scoops. Also was not clear.\\n3- The drill rig was also very confusing at first- but the arms can rotate outwards much further than it appears. You just have to keep moving them in a circle format to fully extend them. Might be easier on controller but on keyboard it was a chore.\\n 4. My biggest complaint and an issue I might be overlooking:\\n\\nWorkers do not seem to continue to work if you are not in the mines. At least it seems that way to me. So not much reason to have all 3 mines working. As there is no fast travel and it takes for ever to travel between mines- I think I am going to sell all the machines at the first mine and just concentrate on either the 2nd or 3rd mine. Someone could clarify if I am missing something here.\\n\\nAnyway- that is my 2 cents- thanks for taking the time to read it.',\n",

       " 'TLDR: I highly recommend Rusted Moss.\\n\\n************************************\\n\\nI was one of the games playtesters and was fortunate to see the game grow over its development cycle. I have completed the game several times, and currently working through a play through of the release version. Even though my current hours on the release build are low, I am writing with the benefit of knowing what is coming from playing it first hand during tests.\\n\\nRusted Moss takes the standard metroidvania with double jumps and replaces it with a challenging but extremely satisfying grappling hook. Some people might find the grapple a challenge at first, but I found as I played more I was able to improve my skill quickly. And once you do.... wow this game really opens up. The satisfaction of landing a sick grappling sequence, or \"breaking\" the game in ways that while intended, allow for a high level of creativity in how you approach the game. Once the game \\'clicks\\', you feel like Spider-Man swinging around as he pleases. The game also has optional climb challenges for those who stray off the beaten path that push the limits of the grappling hook even further. The grapple challenges alone would have justified my purchase as they are extremely fun and allow you to attempt to improve your time, pushing you to be better and better. However, the grapple isn\\'t the only element of the game, and to ignore the other elements would be a mistake as they are also excellent.\\n\\nThe gunplay is tight and satisfying, and playing with mouse and keyboard allows for precise aiming giving me a sense of complete control of my character. When I make a mistake I know it was an execution issue on my end, not a cheap trick from the game. Save points are abundant, which allows you to experiment and go for challenges that otherwise might have seemed too risky. Boss fights have always been the thing I look forward to the most in metroidvanias and Rusted Moss does not disappoint on this front.  I especially love when the grappling hook is integrated into the fight itself as it adds a new element that I have not experienced before this.\\n\\nThe story is an interesting take with morally ambiguous characters, fighting for their lives in a war between the Fae and Humans. With talk of prophecies, secrets, traitors, and double agents, I was fully invested into the story and wanted to progress to find out what would happen next. The music of the game adds to the atmosphere beautifully, immersing me further and further into the game. Going from making me feel transported into the world, to being hyped during a boss fight, or even scared and uneasy in an optional zone that become my instant favourite.\\n\\nIf you are a fan of the metroidvania genre, Rusted Moss is a fresh take with a lot of fun challenges and upgrades to explore. I highly recommend the game, especially to those who ‘click’ with the grappling hook as it opens up the world in a way that I found exciting.',\n",

Now that I've finally played through it (just once so far, though I'm planning on replaying it to make different decisions), I find myself pleasantly surprised. The best Tron game I'd played before this one was either Tron 2.0 or Tron Evolution. I think this one is a lot more interesting than either of those, frankly. It's short, with my first playthrough clocking in around 2 hours, but there's definitely incentive to replay multiple times, as there are several decisions that affect the fates of characters and the roles they play in the story. And at $15, it's hard to be mad about a short runtime.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the writing and the story here. I think this is the most existential and even political that Tron has ever been, and as a fan of the franchise, it's exciting to see a title that feels eager to dive deeper into the pre-established ideas and see what makes them tick. I saw on the writer/director's Twitter that they have multiple games/things already in development for the future of Tron, and if this is any indication of their quality, then I'm 100% on board.\",\n",

Too much useless information and back-story all at once in the beginning (just my opinion). Other than that the characters look good and detailed, the story don't seem so far-fetched as it is in other visual novels, there are some animations and a lot of images.

       " \"Although I found some satisfaction in the game, the gameplay isn't very diverse. Jumps and jacks are the only patterns I've seen. Furthermore, I think there should be more settings, like the ability to change from downscroll to upscroll, as well as change the scroll speed like in normal rhythm games. It is also quite complex to learn the controls since you need to switch between different attacks while hitting different notes. I believe there should only be light attacks, heavy attacks, and blocks otherwise the gameplay would be too complicated since you would need to fight your opponent while hitting your notes with your other hand. Additionally, the mapping appears out of sync, especially in Vertigo. In order to preserve the true feeling of a singing competition between two great musicians, I believe more hard and upbeat songs should be added. I also find it strange that two people would be fighting while singing, but since that's the point of the game, I think it's fine. Moreover, I believe that different game modes, such as 4K, 7K, 9K, etc., should be added. As a conclusion, I think that hard charts and different genres of music should be added to keep the game from becoming boring and bland, and that more content should be added to allow players to discover what they're good at.

It\\'s worth noting that all of the battles in each run are interesting rather than the \"filler\" battles which many similar games feature.\\n\\nFinally the theme/artwork are top notch and there is plenty of content to unlock to give the game some longevity!\\n10/10, A+\\n',\n",

       " \"The game has a pleasing aesthetic and atmosphere to it. The journey takes us from colorful, vibrant landscapes, into medieval dungeons and murky swamps, which presents a welcome change of scenery and mood for each chapter.\\n\\nThe soundtrack is well done, each chapter has its own theme that fits the level and surrounding area, and the audio queues for being close to enemies or being spotted add some tension to the stealth gameplay.\\n\\nThe puzzles are well integrated into the levels, they're not too easy but also not very difficult, which makes it a chill experience while still offering a bit of a challenge. \\n\\nThe stealth segments of the game have a good pacing to them, the levels aren't just extended sneaking sections, but a healthy combination of stealth and exploration with some puzzles thrown into the mix for some variety in gameplay.\\n\\nI played with mouse and keyboard. The game is also compatible with controllers and joysticks. All controls can be remapped to your liking.\\n\\nThe game isn't very long. You can probably finish it in about 2 hours.

Most could be fixed by simply reloading the latest checkpoint, which the game has a good amount of, so you don't really lose much progress.\\n\\nCynthia comes across various collectibles throughout her journey, which offers some replayability should you have missed some. The ability to select and replay levels after completing the story would be a welcome addition, since there is no way to go back to get a collectible you might have missed other than starting a new game, which deletes your previous save.\\n\\n\\nWhat I didn't like as much was the dissonance between the character models. Cynthia, as the player character, has great quality model with physics and a neat selection of cool outfits to collect along her adventure. However, the other NPCs, while not looking too bad, are of noticeably lower quality than Cynthia. It makes sense to have the player be more refined than the NPCs we don't see as often and up-close too much, but it is still a bit jarring during cutscenes to go from Cynthia to an NPC.\\n\\nThe final boss fight was underwhelming and over before I knew it, I was hoping for a bit of a more elaborate final battle.\\nIt sadly felt a bit rushed.\\n\\n\\n[h1]TLDR:[/h1]\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n[list]\\n    [*]Charming artstyle and aesthetics\\n    [*]Lovely OST\\n    [*]Decently challenging puzzles\\n    [*]Well paced gameplay\\n    [*]Very basic character customization\\n    [*]Collectibles offer replayability\\n    [*]Comfortable time killer that could be finished in one sitting\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n[list]\\n    [*]Minor bugs (Some already fixed, others can still be addressed)\\n    [*]Different qualities between character models\\n    [*]Underwhelming final Boss\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\nOverall I rate this game a 7.5/10\\nIt could have been more, but it lived up to my expectations. \\nI definitely had fun with it and I look forward to what Catthia Games will cook up in the future.\",\n",

The card consisted of Weapons, Companions and Equipments. Playing each card will subtracting a turn on both you and the enemies. Any card hit zero first get to hit first.\\n- So its basically a game of wits where you'll have to manage the card you'll play before your team gets to hit  the enemies turn by turn. And trust me, Its not that easy at all. and you are going to losing alot.......This is where Rouge lite elements come into play.\\n\\n1. At the beginning of each match, You'll get to pick 1 out of 3 randomize heroes.  Each will have different hit point and Health point. Also some of them will come pack with the effect such as Barrage (Hit all enemies in the same row) etc. etc.\\n\\n2. You'l die. ALOT. Which if you are able to complete certain objective on each match. You'll progressively unlocking the building on your starting point. Allow for better equipment, companion and pets (And more)\\n\\nSo basically, This game is best because you can swooshing in and out for a quick rush and just leave when you thing just gone down hill and coming back later for better tryout. Its really fun especially when you just want to have something casual and still feeling serious at same time.\\n\\nOh yeah, And the art is cute as hell.

They have done so many quality of life improvements that you new players can enjoy. The bullcrap system with the \"mobile game\" like daily where you send your operators to collect stuff is gone. There used to be so many currencies you had to grind and now the only basic silver & fragments is enough with the premium currency. Grinding operators to get better before was insanely boring, tedious and annoying. Now it\\'s simple and much better. Straight line and you just spend the free to play currency to activate new talents. \\n\\nGraphics are good and so are about 80% of the legendary operator skins. There are few goofed up stuff but rest are some old school gear and then some tactic00l af stuff. Pick the operator you like, read what their skills do and enjoy. Store updates weekly that which operators are on discount. \\n\\nTo all new players, please play the tutorial. I play medic 90% of the time so please, don\\'t run away from me. If you need the heals, go to the medic or stay near the player and if the skill requires a chain or AoE don\\'t leave it. Don\\'t spend your syringes that much since medic can carry 6, save your one syringe when it all hits the fan. \\n\\nI never liked the PvP and never gonna play it. I just love to grind the simple PvE maps and modes. \\n\\nIt\\'s not perfect though, the new voice acting in some maps that are totally redone with \"story\" cutscenes etc. is so abysmal that you may want to mute your dialogs. It is just disgustingly bad. Some random voice actor doing stereotypically bad accents. Should have just stayed with the vanilla voices like in the old maps. There are also some really meta operators for PvE which are just hilariously OP and can carry the whole match. Bourbon is disgustingly OP as hell with Kit. \\n\\nIt is a good free to play game and it is improving more and more.

Of course he was scolded by ScmubagJuJu because he was in no right to do so, yet he did. \\n\\nThe player feedback isn\\'t listen to, believe me, for four years we put up with their lack of balance and bullshit updates to avoid doing anything. They release a new unit, make it broken, literally pay to win, milk them for a few months and then somewhat nerf them.\\n\\nI\\'ve played every game mode, I have a decent amount of earned premium skins and all opeartors [besides the new pay to win americans and chinese] a lot of time spent in game as well. \\nTheir rules are so bad, you can get banned, now let me repeat, you can loose your account, for Tbagging an enemy and or friendly.

       " 'I\\'m really on the fence about this game. When I got it as the very early and incomplete version, it was awesome, arguably the best \"tactical RPG\" I know, even devoid of many features. But, as the versions progressed and the changes were made, it became worse. Today, probably hours away from release, it\\'s... just another tRPG, I guess. With a couple interesting ideas and a number of annoying problems, just like most games.\\n\\nThe changes themselves are quite subtle. (sorry for long explanations, it\\'s fairly intuitive when you actually play).\\nAs an example, there is a very nice implementation of turn order: both your and your opponents\\' men are \"distributed evenly\" in the turn order for the round, so if the number of combatants is equal, you and enemy take turns acting with a single fighter, until all fighters act. However, for the AI, the order of its units acting is fixed, while you can act with any of your guys (who didn\\'t act in this turn yet). While \"unfair\" towards the AI, it provides many interesting choices and tactics.\\nNow, if the enemy has twice as many people as you do, for each of your actions, they make two. So, even if you kill (or otherwise deal with) the guy who acts next (the obvious choice), another enemy will act after that and probably you\\'ll be in some trouble. So, the difference in numbers turns out to be very, very important.\\nWhat did they change? Now, the number of your enemies is always quite close to yours, and in cases it somehow isn\\'t, the extra units will arrive later (when you already killed many enemies) as reinforcements. So, the (rightfully dreaded) experience of being outnumbered is cut off from the game. Now, a lot of battles follow the same pattern: you neutralize the enemy who acts next, then he doesn\\'t do much (or anything at all, if killed), rinse, repeat. A hundred of perfectly forgettable battles. \\n\\nI could write several such examples, including camp management, economy, fog mechanics. The early versions did convey the right experiences: you struggled to stay afloat with money, thoughtfully picked your contracts, took care of your men. But the updates made the game progressively worse. My best guess is, the game designers knew what they are doing and made bold (and really good!) decisions, but then some salespeople took over the game and made it \"accessible for wider audience\" or something - just another game.\\n\\nUPD.

Yeah, it's definitely not a fast paced game that everyone is going to enjoy. Some of the fights I've run into more early on in the game have taken long periods of time both in setup/strategy and because of the turn-based nature of the game. It'll take a couple of tries to get things right starting out and it's pretty easy to lose companions if you're not paying attention to everything that's going on.\\nMicromanaging your wages, food and companions' relationships is challenging and rewarding, making the overall hardcore feeling of the game much more appealing for players like me.

       " 'Yes',\n",
       " 'The basic premise of the game is that you control a changing party of mercenaries and seek your fortune in a low-fantasy open world. As this is essentially the same premise as Battle Brothers, which I\\'m very familiar with, I\\'m going to compare the two in my review. I think a lot of people who will be interested in this newer game (still EA) will have already tried Battle Brothers, so such a comparison may be helpful to them.\\n\\nCompared to BB, this game has a much greater sense of REALISM; every experience is more immersive. Instead of moving your party\\'s icon across the map, you will see your group of members, complete with their beast(s) of burden and wagon(s), walking across the world itself. There are lots of points of interest in the world for you to interact with, including resource deposits to collect, groups of travelers of different factions, towns to visit, tombs to explore, etc. Most locations allow for you to search for things, sort of like a hidden object game. When you enter a town, there are multiple locations to visit, but they\\'re a bit more involved than simply a menu with a list of options. Sometimes there are puzzles or quests involving multiple people, and in many cases you\\'ll have to choose which faction to side with. Rather than hiring non-combat followers like BB, each of your companions can choose a profession which is very useful for the party as a whole; for example, you can designate someone to be a cook, which will enable them to cook recipes from food ingredients, and someone else to be a miner, allowing them to extract ore from mines. Most professions are associated with a mini-game; an angler has a little game in which you try to keep a fish on the line. The crafting system involves gathering resources from many sources: from town shops, from travelling merchants, from harvesting natural deposits, from skinning defeated animals; and then unlocking recipes that can be completed in your camp or in a dedicated workshop. The sheer number of things to do, and the way they all connect and benefit your team - it\\'s a very impressive system. In terms of the fantasy element: if BB is a \"low\" fantasy world, this seems to be a \"lower\" fantasy world. If there is any sort of magic (beyond certain alchemy potions) or fantastic creatures (beyond a humongous rat) in this game, I have not discovered it yet.\\n\\nGRAPHICALLY, the game outshines BB in every way. All people have full 3D models; all movements, battle skills, etc. are fully animated, and they\\'re done so very well. I\\'m not knocking Battle Brothers here at all; it simply focuses on gameplay and doesn\\'t endeavor to do a whole lot graphically, and people who enjoy it aren\\'t looking to be wowed with graphics. That said, this game does, and uses the graphics for full immersion in a very impressive way.\\n\\nThe COMBAT is comparable to Battle Brothers, each having strengths and weaknesses. One of my favorite things about both games is that everybody can die. For real. For good. If you suck and let one of your guys die, they\\'re dead. Gone. Bye bye. When I said your party is *changing*, that\\'s what I meant: if you bite off more than you can chew, they\\'ll be pushing up daisies in no time, and you\\'ll have to recruit replacements. That said, combat in this game is *slightly* more forgiving, in that there\\'s a mechanic applied to all your characters that essentially gives them the \"nine-lives\" perk from BB; that is, if they would be killed by a blow the first time, they survive it for a moment but will die for real if they take any more damage before they are healed. \"Healed\", meaning a realistic first aid skill that doesn\\'t magically put them back to full health - it stops bleeding, burning, etc., and gives them a few hitpoints. A major difference between this game and BB is that battles are affected very little by RNG rolls; it rarely determines whether attacks hit or miss. (It does affect the order that enemies take their turns, as well as damage output for most skills.) Another major difference is that the tactical maps are not hex-based; they are based on realistic distances. Characters, depending on their movement ability, may be able to move up to, say, 10 meters. Positioning is very important, as different skills and weapons have different ranges (in meters). There are also natural hazards for certain tactical maps, such as falling rocks in caves, or lightning strikes during storms. (I actually find that these detract from the realism a bit, however, for two reasons: #1 in real life, they don\\'t happen often enough to be a real factor in any battle of this size; #2, you get a preview of the AoE for these hazards before the turn, so you know exactly where and when they will occur, and you have plenty of time to get your guys out of the way.) In all, the combat feels very good in this game. I\\'m delighted to tell you that I screwed the pooch about 20 times before I finally figured out how to keep my guys alive.\\n\\nYour COMPANIONS can be recruited from inns, from prisons, or other sources, such as solving a dilemma a certain way or completing a quest. You can also take prisoners and force them to do your bidding, including even taming most animals in the game and having them fight for you. Unlike BB, they have classes rather than backgrounds; the classes determine what options are available when they level up, so the customization doesn\\'t feel quite as flexible as BB. You cannot equip any armor/weapon on any class. Only an Archer can use a bow, and he/she can\\'t use anything else (that I\\'m aware of); in the event that they are forced into a melee attack, they can only use their fist to punch for a couple points\\' damage. The Ranger class is essentially a \"rogue\" from most RPG-type games. They can only wield a knife and an option off-hand weapon. I\\'m not sure why he\\'s called a \"ranger\", as his primary weapon is not ranged and he doesn\\'t really have any connection to nature or animals. As far as the uniqueness of characters\\' appearance, there are about 5 faces, 5 hairstyles, 5 beards, 5 hair colors, etc that you can choose from. So you can customize... just not a lot. However, companions can be either male or female, though I\\'m not sure of the full implications of this, or if it\\'s simply an aesthetic choice. As you progress through the game, events can happen (like in BB) where characters acquire new traits or even promotions. When you hire someone, you don\\'t know how exactly they will end up a month down the road.\\n\\nPROCEDURAL GENERATION: This is the main area where BB triumphs over Wartales, as it has a fully generated, randomized world for each game. This is the main reason why I have over 4000 hours in it: it\\'s hugely replayable. In comparison, the world of Wartales and most things in it were manually designed. RNG does affect some things from game to game, such as which items are available for sale at different locations, where/when some resources will appear, who will be travelling where and when, the order that quests will appear, etc. However, the world is otherwise a map of the same area from game to game. You can re-play the game with different characters, strategies, skills, and whatnot, and you can unlock different starting areas as you progress through the game; however, you will still be playing the same world, and you\\'ll know all locations, stories, main quests, and decisions ahead of time, provided that you\\'ve discovered them before in an earlier playthrough. In my opinion, this is the only real drawback to this game compared with BB; but for me, it\\'s a major one.\\n\\nThat said, this is a very fun, high-quality game with a ton of stuff to see and do and try out. What the developers set out to do, they have achieved remarkably. And it\\'s still only Early Access - you can bet it\\'s only going to get better as they continue to add more of the same.',\n",
       " 'this is a hidden Gem! very good so far. it is essentially a top down rpg, you do have a party but move all as one unit on the map with shared inventory so you dont have to swap between inventories of party members. the world is explored top down crpg like diablo or Wasteland and when combat is engaged it plays turn based akin to divinity with cool kill animations, and some environmental things. its got a pretty in depth crafting system and each character can have a profession they can skill up at and craft better stuff. there is also fun mini games like fishing and armor crafting and based on performance in mini game is the quality of item. it does have difficulty scaling so you can customize it to meet the level you find fun both on survival and combat elements.  party management does not feel like a chore as you find contracts to get paid to pay your merc party and can find food in wild/ hunting fishing gathering. also you can find crafting materials in world for crafting gear and cooking food. camping is fun and intuitive. all in all im having a blast and i wish i picked it up sooner. if you like the idea of a free roam top down crpg with crafting and good turn based combat that is simple yet fun this could be your new best friend. have not ran into any stability issues yet and only one small bug that was not a hindrance in any way.',\n",

However the difficulty of DS is self scalable and a tone setter for the game. \\nWare tales however is just difficult. Don't get me wrong, i enjoy a game that seriously stresses my mind. I wait with anticipation for Frostpunk 2. However when a game artificially makes its setting difficult for the sake of being difficult, no thanks...\\nNumber of points.\\n1 Game economics are terrible. You can tell the economic capability of a game like this based of the craft cost. A crafted item should generally be worth more than the base components that went into it. This can vary if there is a price change due to quantity in a market (not for Wartales). When i went over the general prices for many crafted items, about 1/3 to 1/2 are just straight out less cost effective than their base components. This is disheartening to see at the start of a game. I didn't even factor in the general cost of acquiring the items in terms of party upkeep. You can grind the game out and make progress with the system possibly. That was just a massive red flag for me right away.\\n2 Combat is completely unbalanced. I know, people with tell me that it was fine for them, just use strategy, or if you do it this certain way than its just fine. A game like this should reward you for thinking tactically, not demand it. I don't enjoy spending an abundant amount of time strategizing on each tedious fight. Also if you are fighting same level enemies as you, the general expectation is that their capabilities will be the same. If the enemy can do double my damage at the same level and class, that's an artificial difficulty adjustment for the sake of being difficult. I don't enjoy it, and i don't enjoy being given paltry rewards for it. At least one wound at least per encounter for me, costing me at least 20 in craft good cost for a medicine, reward worth about 15 or 20. Just disappointing after the effort.\\n3 The story is lost in the survival. Any semblance of story that you might come across gets lost in the desperation to simply survive. You will make decisions based on your current needs more than on your morals at the start. Maybe this is the tale they are trying to convey. That life looses meaning when you stop living and just survive. Well they are right and that, in the end, is why i didn't exactly enjoy this game. I play games to live, not simply survive.\",\n",

I only have 4 companions and 2 beasts to try to keep the food consumption down but it is non-stop annoying that you are constantly running out of food, never have enough gold to buy anything from vendors really so only option is to steal and then you spend the time running from patrols.

A game title like \"Wartales\" feels like a \"Play the way you want to with the backstory you want\" type game.  But this is just purely, fight, loot, repair, eat, sleep, repeat.\\n\\nOh, uhm.. once I figured out how to effectively and efficiently craft items for trade, it added an additional 10hrs of gameplay of renewed excitement realizing I could make more money by crafting from random loot and selling the crafted items. But then I hit my limit again once I managed to consistently stay over 1000 gold or so.\\n\\nAfter all that and completing the first area and moving to the second, I felt like I hit a wall to play this game as it felt it\\'s a rinse and repeat regardless of the region you\\'re in or the background of your team.\\n\\nOverall, this EA reminds me of other EAs I played where I play for a solid week or two and then hit a hard stop for many years as it just didn\\'t feel wholesome or satisfying.  I guess I\\'ll keep TRYING to play a bit more to see what else I can uncover..\\n\\nI don\\'t really thumbs down games but would definitely give this game a \"MEH\" for now.\\nMaybe other users have a more fulfilling and exhilarating experience instead?\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Once the autoleveling is addressed too, they will have my thumbsup\\n\\nIt's true. You currently have a lot of gameplay due the big map it already includes. You will really enjoy the early game once you have finished struggling figuring out how everything works, because it's not only there is no tutorial at all, it's that they have not even included tooltips or explanations for all the minigames involving crafting. \\n\\nAnd this is one of the cons I see in this game. It doesn't give you any feedback, you don't know any details about the character classes, which weapons they may use or what abilities will be unlocked when promoting one of your companions to captain or lieutenant. First times you promote someone it’s a guess game adventure, like getting a new crafting recipe for a weapon (no, brutes can’t use axes… seriously?).\\n\\nThe other big reason to not recommend Wartale right now there is no mid or late game content. You can only advance until level 5 and, after that, your companions will randomly get skill points whenever they get a nickname (it may occur several times for the same one and, guess what, the game doesn’t explain why or when nicknames are earned or changed). The only thing that escalates the game is the autoleveling of all the enemies around, which is only useful to generate more of the same with the difference that you will get combats of half an hour or 1 hour instead of the aprox 15 minutes during the early game. Spending almost one hour fighting superboars over and over again in epic battles is not fun, it’s repetitive and boring.\\n\\nNevertheless, there are around 10-15 hours of early game quite enjoyable and fun (learning process included). You should do the math if that’s worth 35 € EA for you… But do it in advance, by the time you have learned the game and have passed the exciting first date and start facing reality (the repetition of endless battles), you will not be eligible for a steam refund anymore. \\n\",\n",

       " \"Rusted Moss is a charming game that oozes atmosphere, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But it has several problems. For a 20 euro game, it feels unpolished, like an early access title. I would honestly have preferred to pay 30 for a more polished version of this game.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\nFirst, the game is marketed as a twin-stick shooter. But booting the game up it told me to use mouse and keyboard, rather than controller. Using my PS4 controller, the game also doesn't show me correct button symbols, and does not let me bind certain controls to certain buttons (I have not tried using Steam's controller support for this game since many games reliably fail to show correct button symbols.)\\n\\nSecond, the game is marketed as a metroidvania. However, in playing it for six hours I found that the movement system, while rich and with a high skill ceiling, does not properly tutorialize several mechanics and does not properly encourage experimentation because of its difficulty. The level design does not adequately communicate which traversals are possible with the player's current skill set. With my disabilities, I found myself wondering which parts of the game I was 'allowed' to use the fly assist to bypass, and which I was supposed to be gated from entering for story progression reasons. Additionally, in six hours of playing and defeating three major bosses, I found a distressingly small amount of new abilities: the grapple, the high jump, a different gun, and grenades; there were plenty stat upgrades to be sure, but no genuine additions to the kit.\\n\\nThird, the game is positively punishing in difficulty. This isn't a problem as such, but it is executed in frustrating fashion. The high-skill traversal system makes certain stretches between save points feel like unforgiving gauntlets, both because of the platforming and the enemy ecounters. This is exacerbated greatly by the fact that all progress since last save is lost upon death: all rooms explored, all collectibles found, all lost upon death. For certain collectibles, this made it harrowing to return to a save point.\\n\\nFourth, the combat system feels less than fun. The guns have great sound design and interesting firing modes, but the range is so short it feels like artificial difficulty. Since movement is so high-skill as well, this eliminates the greatest advantage the player would otherwise have: positioning. It makes regular enemy encounters feel like a hazard to avoid, in a game that hands the player a machine gun in the first ten seconds. Also the fact that grenades and healing use the same resource just serves to punish the player and disincentivize using the weapons available.\\n\\nFifth, there's a couple of minor annoyances. Mostly there are no genuine secrets to find, hidden walls and the like; but I have managed to find at least one instance of a genuinely hidden item close to the starting area, which felt very out of place. It is also possible to unintentionally skip non-repeatable dialogue, and there's no log of previous conversations to review in case that happens. For a game with such a detailed assist menu, it feels rather patronizing that the only option for circumventing platforming troubles is straight up flight; extra grapples in the air would have been a welcome addition, again like Celeste. Also the auto aim just plainly doesn't work.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\nFirst, the writing. The character dialogue is execellent and genuinely funny. The worldbuilding is compelling and the story isn't front-loaded. Fern and Puck have a pre-established dynamic, and the story begins in medias res after an apocalyptic event, the details of which the player has to uncover. It is a refreshing work of fiction. (The only thing that frustrates me is how the grim tone clashes with the fact that the bosses are mostly left alive and hale for some reason. Would to me make more sense if they died in the battle, or at least were shown to be injured in some way in the aftermath, but that's a nitpick.)\\n\\nSecond, the aesthetic presentation. The graphics are gorgeous, the pixel animation style is well executed and feels nostalgically retro in all the right ways. I am in particular smitten with how each biome has a distinct color tint to the menu; very atmospheric. The animations are solid, the character design is varied and interesting, and the enemy variety is diverse despite all of them being machines. It reminds me of other great works such as Risk of Rain and Hyper Light Drifter.\\n\\nThird, the music is wonderful. It sets the mood of each area without being intrusive, and it is definitely worth buying the OST download if you like listening to video game soundtracks.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nRusted Moss is a action-horror platformer with exploration focus. It sets the player up against armies of enemies that the arsenal does not adequately address, and rewards avoiding combat and conserving resources more so than proficient combat. The story is dark, bleak, and apocalyptic, with the player fighting on the side of an inhuman, callously uncaring evil. It struggles with gameplay, but excels in story and visuals.\\n\\n3/5\",\n",

I think this game is doing a lot that I really enjoy: the movement, guns (mostly), aesthetic, and music. \\n\\nBut some things feel off:\\n- Mainly most of the maps I've played have felt really small for an arena based game, it often felt like I had way more movement than I needed for the scale of these areas. I know it wasn't an issue of movement because in the more open maps things felt fine. Side note for wall jumping: I think this feature is severely underused. I don't think there was a single instance where I felt that wall jumping would be useful or the better tech option over slide jumping. Just something to consider.\\n- Then there was the issue of the friendly AI: either the friendly AI is able to essentially play by itself (one flag CTF), or was pretty much useless (Control mode). I would find the AI just sitting in a corner doing nothing or bum rushing the objective and dying almost immediately. This forced me to have to essentially play both the role of offense and defense, though mainly defense. \\n- The story thus far has been rough in its' presentation. Too much is thrown at you way too quickly, and my understanding of the world is nonexistent. Your character, Molly, literally spawns into the world and is immediately informed that she is some form of undead that has been brought back to life to compete in arena shooter style combat. Cool, great launch pad for some interesting cyberpunk/hackerman energy. But very quickly after your first clue that things are not what they seem, the story ramps up way too fast without any build up. You're introduced to a cast of character that you very quickly realize don't have a whole lot to do outside of being unique skins for the AI to use in combat. I got the sense that these characters  are supposed to be the main cast you're dealing with, but they have next to nothing to do or say - I just don't care about them. Only one of them gives off a memorable first impression and that's because you have to kill him in the arena. The story also introduces a character that further calls into question the things that have been going on, except the issue is that you haven't had a long enough time to actually see what things are normally like in this world to actually question what had been established. Going forward I would recommend that the story team be a little more patient with showing their hand. Just establish the world that Molly first spawns into: who brought her here, what is their reason, where is she, who are these other characters, what are the basic rules of this world? Let the player understand SOMETHING and have a reason to care about it before you try and subvert what you've established, or begin adding in stakes for characters that I don't have a reason to care about.\\n- This is my last issue, but it is related to story: the dialogue. It is often ROUGH. The tone is jovial and light, but it is entirely at odds with everything else. The humor is pretty shallow and frankly I wished it was toned down a lot. The dialogue between characters is pretty pointless. It gives you pretty much no extra information about the characters or the world. They seem entirely disconnected from everything going on around them.\\n- Final thing: The pistol feels off, I don't know if its damage or rate of fire (for either firing mode), but it felt wrong in comparison to every other weapon. Not a huge deal, maybe I just need more time with it. \\n\\nIn conclusion: I like this game a lot. Playing the game was fun, and though the story hasn't impressed me, almost all of the elements they've introduced in the story are, or could be, really interesting. I have my issues but ultimately I want to see more. SO KEEP GOING DEVS! YOU GUYS HAVE SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL HERE :) \\n\",\n",

I've done this twice, but never got level 5 upgrades because I died before surviving 500 seconds following the 400 enemies. So I 'completed' the goal but died, nulling the goal.

It\\'s not overly heavy on the RPG side though, pretty thin for story and dialogue, but it\\'s forte is turn based combat.  \\n\\nPROs\\n- Great map interaction, full of little Easter eggs to find\\n- Fun game-like interactions with picking locks, solving puzzles, using skills, finding hidden objects by searching the screen with cursor etc...\\n- Large groups!\\n- Can recruit animals\\n\\nCONs\\n- Hard to get going in the early levels, as your small party takes a beating and needs repairs and healing often; gets easier with more members as the overall damage gets spread out between everyone\\n- Combat gets tedious toward the end, and gets very lopsided with your band gets larger\\n- Each map zone has a different back story quest to solve, but over all they\\'re identical in nature.  Main quest, side missions from tavern contacts, and random missions to stumble upon.\\n- Traveling the map is a chore with the length of day and having to rest... seems like you can\\'t travel more than a minute before you have to rest again.  Really needs to be addressed as it\\'s a big detractor from just trying to get around the map and enjoy the game\\n- Very simple combat system... armor is extra hp, and all damage types translate to hp damage.  There\\'s no chance of missing/dodging an attack during melee, so you area always getting hit every time.  Each side trades turns until one side eventually has more people left\\n- Tedious having to constantly pay and feed your party, but camp site structures help reduce that headache\\n- Not a big mix of enemies\\n- You can buy pack \"ponies\" for hauling more gear, but can\\'t ride horses to make traveling faster?!\\n- lack of in game quest guide tips, had to use youtube videos at times to figure out what was going on in some quests\\n\\nI played this game on the fixed level option, so each zone had a set level range.  The starter zone was challenging to get going.  The second zone was fair, but after completing it I out leveled the third zone to the SW and quickly ran through that quest and all missions in a single round of combat every time (think I was lvl 5-6 and the enemy was level 3 or so.  By the time I got the the last zone in the east, I had already started to collect bears for fun, and ended up with 12 or so bears as they\\'re more common on the harder zones (had wolves too but let them go as the bears racked up), and 14 other guys.  It ended up silly as the bears are absolute tanks with 1000+ hp, and can hit for 70+ damage and take up a lot of map space squares to provide nice meat shields for the rest of my party.  I could have just dumped all my human members except for a couple and a beast master, and just played the bears.  The good thing with having animals is you only need to feed them, not pay them, and you don\\'t have to fully feed your group as the other camp bonuses make up for losing happiness due to lack of food.',\n",

Unlike other deckbuilders your main heros hp does not carry over between battles, this means that fights rarely whittle your resources slightly so that you would die three fights from now at the boss. Instead there are less individual fights in a run, but you will regularly go from full strength to dead in a single fight. One or two misplays can kill you if you're not paying attention because every fight needs to be potentially lethal by design. Personally I like it, as beating the fights while killing all the 'treasure goblins' is fun in the early game. While beating the back half requires good deck construction and execution. \\n\\nThe things that set this apart from other games I've played is the style polish and charm. The bells jingle, the characters move when you drag the cards around. The shopkeeps and town are adorable.  The art is very cohesive and gives the world a sense of whimsy. It puts a smile on my face every time I meet a new npc. Also the game is just fun. \\n\\nMany other deckbuilders start of incredibly slow and easy for me, and only become interesting once you unlock the middle difficulty settings. This one starts slightly higher on the difficulty but has been entertaining the entire time.\",\n",

       " 'I really enjoy the game and played 3h in the raw. It is taking the best of Slay the Spire but also from Rogue Legacy with our village to build up bringing further cards to build up your deck. However the main issue and I’ve seen other sharing this concern is the game is yet to be well balanced. Any deck building game you’re playing will make a you a hard time the first rounds but once you understand the enemies and your deck then you should never lose the first fights. But here you can because it will depends on what you get when you start. And because you got only one support for the first battle you can get overwhelmed very easily. I went through the third world (two boss fight won) and then I play again and loose again the first battle. So definitely some work to do but the ground is solid and this will be a must have once the balance has been fixed. Or maybe it will never be as this is something that can happen in Rogue Legacy too. Let’s see but I still recommend it. Great game overall.',\n",
       " \"A rogue lite deck builder with some neat querks that makes it stand out from the rest.\\nThe difficulty is quite a lot higher than I expected but I don't mind it much as the core gameplay loop is very fun & addictive \\n\\nRuns amazing on the steam deck\",\n",

       " 'The art style is beautiful, meta progression is implemented in a fun and engaging way that somewhat encourages the player to branch out and try some new stuff ocasionally, the HUD elements are simple and to the point, the soundtrack and visual effects are excellent and although it appears somewhat complex, learning the basics to the combat flow was a breeze. This game has tons of elements that really make it stand out above the crowd, and it does a lot of things in a fresh manner that make it seem a rather promising title, if the proper care is put into it.\\n\\nDespite all this, at around 20 runs and 3 hours in, it has become clear that the balancing is abysmal. On my first few runs I just brushed it off to being new at the game, but after dying to the first battle in the campaign the first couple of times I figured something was way off, and it seems like this is a common issue to those that have already played the game. Even \\nsome positive reviews list it as an unbalanced mess\\n\\nEnemies are numerous and extremely punishing. I enjoy having certain \"factions\" of foes, each possessing varying abilities and passives. You have enemies that focus on shielding themselves, enemies that use their hp as attack value and enemies that focus on debuffing. That being said, each enemy type requires you to have a certain \"answer\" to their skillset, which becomes a frustrating element of the game when you have such limited options to expand your deck and absolutely no way of knowing which enemies you\\'ll end up facing. Got a build that focuses on attacking?  Too bad, for the next fight you\\'ll be pitted against thorned enemies. Oh well, better luck next time. Having fights test the player\\'s deck in different aspects is a great way of keeping the gameplay fresh but this is a ludicrous way of doing so. \\n\\nLet\\'s also talk about the wave system in battles. The counter ticks down every turn to punish the player for stalling out fights which is a cool way of keeping combat fluid and engaging, but defeating enemies before the timer runs out just causes instant reinforcements anyway. With that in mind, the player\\'s choice is between 1. Dragging out combat in an attempt to scale your team to face the army of threats aproaching and 2. Rushing the enemies to try and defeat most of them before you get overwhelmed. Not exactly a good way to reward quickly disposing of enemies since you get fucked over for doing so anyway.\\n\\nHeroes being randomized was something that caught my eye when watching people playing the demo. After playing for a while, though, I wish they had stuck to a more basic approach instead of this messy implementation. Most heroes are delightfully useless, and serve more as a burden than anything else, since you\\'re obligated to put them on the board. If you get unlucky enough with your draw, you might end up just dying outright to the first battle, before you even get a chance to modify your deck, which, albeit hilarious, is pretty bad from a balancing perspective.\\n\\nThe timer on actions was also a fun mechanic to mess around with and explore when I was starting out. However, this means action economy is terribly unbalanced (just as many, many other aspects of this game\\'s combat). The mana system used in most modern deckbuilders triumphs greatly over Wildfrost\\'s take, here, when it becomes painstakingly difficult to keep up with enemies when the players\\' actions are both costly and widely uninpactful. \\n\\nIt seems wildfrost is trying to place itself as a challenging game, which I enjoy greatly, but there\\'s also this feeling that the game is afraid of giving the player any agency. You have no reroll options, no chance to pass up a companion or an item (that I encountered in my short time playing) that\\'ll bloat your deck or be left to gather dust in the reserve, and it makes me scratch my head and ask: \"why?\"\\n\\nCompanions themselves (and heroes, for that matter) are largely designed to be brittle and fragile, as to make positioning and delaying enemy actions (or killing them outright before they even get a chance to act) important, but at the same time, the game makes them widely meek compared to enemies. You have heroes with whopping 7 cooldown triggers that dont even deal direct damage. You have pets, which are unique to the start of the game, occupying a slot that could be used for a companion later, which actively encourage you to trash them when you get better units.\\n\\n Most synergies that don\\'t work instantly with your starter hero will be disappointing until more companions and items are in your deck (if you even survive to that point) that fit that particular role, and you\\'re not even guaranteed to get any. Add this to the fact that you have a measly 2 slots for companions before you have to replace some, and also that you\\'re not even guaranteed heroes that\\'ll sinergize with anything and things will start to look bleak before you even start a run.\\n\\nI could go on and on. Wildfrost\\'s current state in balancing is apalling. I would ask for a refund if I could. I encourage anyone reading this to either skip completely or wait for a heavy discount. Of course, I\\'ll edit this if things change, but even if I\\'m being optimistic, there\\'s a lot, and I mean [b] a lot [/b], of work to be put in this game before I\\'d recommend it.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"I've been with this game for about a year, so into early access but not super far back, and seeing this game just get progressively better every new patch is great.\\n\\nPros:\\n-Combat is super fun. It can be really challenging at times, but not impossible to the point where it feels like you're climbing up a mountain. There's a lot of strategy, especially on the expert difficulty (which you should play on), and the enemy variety, as well as environmental factors and many other small things, makes it so that every skirmish is different. Each class have subclasses which amounts to a huge variety of combos you can run. You can have really dope synergies in your troop.\\n-Campaign mechanics, aka when you're walking around with your troop, picking up quests, feeding them, etc, is very satisfying. It's not super micromanagement heavy, but you still need to pay attention to your ressources, your troop's happiness, your relationships, food and gold so your playthrough doesn't go haywire.\\n-Graphics are good and very consistent. The style of the game is nice to look at and each area has something new to look at. most areas will look different, combat animations are very crisp and have a lot of girth and power behind them, and extra things like weather look good to.\\n-The devs are super proactive and responsible. They constantly listen to player feedback and they're on top of patching and updating the game. Major respect for that.\\n\\nCons:\\n-The game doesn't really have a main story. If you want a story driven game, this ain't it, because this is one of those 'make your own story' games. The lack of a main narrative doesn't really upset me personally, but not having characters or a plot really takes away from choices you have to make throughout your playthroughs. It's not that big of a downfall.\\n-Difficulty scaling in this game can be a little weird at times. For the most part, I think the difficulty is pretty reasonable (it also depends on the difficulty your playing on). However, it's very easy to get absolutely dumpstered early on by enemies that you really shouldn't run in to. Even in the mid and late parts of the game, some fights like arena challenges are pretty unfair at times, sometimes warranting the acquirement of some legendary weapons or serious levelling up to stand a chance.\\n-It's not as big of a problem as it used to be, but foraging for resources on the campaign map is still a little janky at times. Sometimes resources spawn outside the map or in impossible to reach places, and your troop's movement is very sensitive. It can be really annoying at times when you're trying to go up a hill but there's a small bit of impassible terrain in your way and your troops completely ignores its move order. The devs are aware of this jankiness however and i'm certain this will be addressed more in the future.\\n-Relationships in your troop happen passively overtime, whether your guys are saving each other's asses, drinking booze together by the fire and joking, or doing the opposite and cursing each other out, fighting one another, etc. It's cool, but it really doesn't change much in the game. You get small bonuses if 'friends' are next to each other, but the damage bonuses are very small and aren't super noticeable. From the start of my longest playthrough to the end of it where my relationships started at 0 until I had a troop of 23 guys who all loved each other, I could hardly tell if relationships had done anything. Hopefully they're changed to be more prevalent and actually affect the troop more seriously like in Darkest Dungeon 2.\\n\\nThese cons are very minor and in a few months time, I bet they will have been addressed by the devs already, so take them with a grain of salt. The fact I can only think of these minor negatives about Wartales says a lot about how fun this game is. Definitely worth the purchase, even at its full price, and if you see it on sale, 100% grab it if you're even slightly interested.\\n\\n9.5/10\",\n",

Maybe it will scale up in difficulty as I progress, like Slay the Spire did.  I have finished 2 runs and the game has been quite fun already.  I didn't find it to be too difficult; in fact, on my first blind play-through, I reached what was probably the final boss.  I lost to him because I didn't understand his mechanics, but I think I understand them now and that defeating him should be quite doable.  I think I could have won on my 2nd play-through, but I was playing at 2 AM and due to tiredness left my leader in front of the boss's 50 damage attack when I had plenty of ways to prevent that from happening.  I think I definitely would have won otherwise.  Either way, not bad for a 2nd play-through.  \\n\\nAll that is to say, I don't think this game is too hard at all, and I think it has a lot of interesting synergies that I am eager to explore.  If you have ever gotten an Ascension 20 heart kill in Slay the Spire, then ignore all of the negative reviews complaining about difficulty and balance.  The same can be said if you've ever gotten a max covenant win in Monster Train.  \\n\\nThis game has pleasant art and sound design.  The way you play cards in rows is somewhat reminiscent of Monster Train, but there are other aspects which make the game play feel quite unique, like only playing 1 card per turn (mostly, unless you have a specific buff on a card).  \\n\\nI'm glad I bought the game.  I have played enough Slay the Spire (about 500 hours) and Monster Train (about 200 hours) that I have been burnt out on both of them several times.

There are some issues:\\n- Enemies that force 'Aimless' onto your allies or have Aimless themselves feel very unfair, forcing your units to attack into thorns or other detrimental effects or to possibly get sniped by enemies. I think like 50% of my runs ended to Aimless RNG.\\n- No option to decline card additions or hero additions.\\n- Starting heroes can be very very bad with not many ways to salvage them.\\n- No ways to mitigate bad RNG--not enough removal options. Maybe put discovered charms in the shop at a higher cost (Slay the Spire does this with relics and its a nice touch). There are a lot of charms that feel completely useless.\\n- Limited path branching means not as much agency with map nodes--would like to see that expanded to have more choices.\\n\\nI really hope they plan on making balance changes.

They mostly complain about game balance, but the game offers a lot of powerful mechanics to the player, and challenges presented feel very reasonable, usually only requiring a shift in strategy to address. Think Slay the Spire, that game is brutally difficult and is beloved for it, this game is in the exact same vein. Yes it\\'s hard, but it offers so many ways for the player to succeed. Clear example is the companion Yuki, you can easily buff him to have more than 30 attack (heck much more in my experience) simply by spamming frost, this is enough to kill most bosses in one hit. He\\'s too squishy for a particular boss? Give him shields. Low on health? Recall him, the attack buff stays for the whole combat. Anyways my actual review is below.\\n\\nMy experience playing this has been absolutely great. First of all I love to see a fully complete game being released, it\\'s surprisingly uncommon these days. Past that the game oozes charm and is extremely fun to boot. I\\'ll lay out some pros and cons, but generally if you like card roguelikes and the art you\\'ll love this one.\\n\\nPros\\n- Absolutely charming art\\n- Fun characters\\n- Unique and interesting card roguelike format\\n- Card effects feel varied and unique\\n\\nCons\\n- Random leader selection is a fun idea but leaders often feel less powerful and unique as the companion cards',\n",

For positives the the visuals/music are amazing, and I love the character designs. Everything is just so bright and color, definitely stands out compared to the likes of Monster Train and Slay the Spire. Though in a game like this I feel gameplay is the most important part, and this game stumbles rather hard on that front. You either get an amazing combo within the first 1-2 areas or you die. It ramps up far to quickly most of the time, to the point where most strategies don't work because you can't wait to get the cards you need. Either the card works now or you die, with rarely any inbetween. Hell you can get an amazing combo and still die thanks to the enemies just hard countering your strategy. Have fun with that barrage build when the enemies have nothing but teeth. There are plenty of interesting ideas don't get me wrong, but there really needs to be some work with this.

       " \"I have to echo many of the sentiments of those who have had issues with this game. I want to love Wildfrost, the graphics and presentation are just utterly amazing. The charm that this game imparts is something that keeps drawing me back to play another run, but the immense number of balance issues prevent me from trying this game any further. This is sad given that I absolutely love this genre, and would've loved another game to sink more time into, but in its current form, I cannot recommend it.\\n\\nBalance issues are as follows:\\n\\n1. Heroes are generally pretty bad: The heroes that you get to select at the beginning are, more often than not, underwhelming and completely eclipsed by the enemies you'll face, both in terms of health and damage output. This makes the early game significantly more difficult as I found that I was always leaning towards the tougher heroes and neglecting the ones with special abilities, simply to ensure that I had enough output to keep up with the games difficulty ramp.\\n\\n2. Most companions, charms and treasures are either bad, or just actively make your deck worse: Building a deck around some kind of strategy becomes either rare, or nearly impossible when the choices of companions you're presented with are basically unplayable, or don't meld well with your existing deck. The inability to 'skip' a pick, means you're forced to actively add cards to your deck that make an already bad deck, worse. The charms are all over the place, and the fact that you only get a single charm to pick from when you find them in the dispensers means that quite often you get less out of the route you take then you would otherwise need to keep up. Many of the charms are just straight up bad. I only once in all my runs managed to put some kind of coherent strategy together, and even then it wasn't enough to beat the run.\\n\\n3. Enemies swarm you: It didn't take long me to realise that this games balance has some serious issues, particularly when waves of enemies keep spawning at a rate far greater than your ability to dispose of them. Given that many enemies can act faster, have more health, and even hit harder than anyone on your team, it makes the swarming even worse. Most of my runs ended because I simply couldn't keep up with the sheer number of enemies that were appearing on the screen. When the mini-boss of each stage appears, if you haven't sufficiently dealt with prior enemies, it can make the game unplayable in terms of difficulty.\\n\\nI enjoy a challenging game, and don't mind taking the time to learn how to play these better in order to overcome the difficulty, but Wildfrost's balance makes any attempt to trying to do that seemingly pointless. Beating this game seems to come down more to RNG with card choices, and charms then it does with the actual skill of the player. Either you lucked out on an extremely good deck, or your run is just dead.\\n\\nFor the above reasons (and many others that have been mentioned in other reviews), I cannot recommend Wildfrost.\",\n",

I felt like I got some nice synergies going, but definitely made some mistakes along the way due to not knowing how all the different systems worked.

I had a buddy watch me from the side and with all the shimmying about I was doing to hit the enemies, I neglected the bullets that were apparently obvious. Now, that might be my ADHD at play, but I was definitely getting better about avoiding most of the onslaught of projectiles. Another issue is the controls.

I both saved and killed the Cheerleader in the first level with Renfield, but there was no obvious difference in result, save for time remaining upon reaching the boss room and the amount of money that was rewarded.

The graphics and sound design evoke a haunting atmosphere, with eerie music and unsettling visuals that keep you on the edge of your seat.\\n\\nDye The Bunny's narrative is both chilling and captivating, making it difficult to look away even when you're on the verge of screaming. The game's developers have taken a creative risk by combining the innocence of childhood with the darkness of horror, and the result is a unique experience that will leave a lasting impression on players.\\n\\nOverall, Dye The Bunny is a must-play for horror enthusiasts and those seeking a fresh twist on a classic holiday celebration. Its chilling atmosphere, engaging gameplay, and memorable storyline make it an Easter horror game that you won't soon forget. But be warned - you may never see the Easter Bunny in the same way again.\",\n",

       " 'Expect a lot of reviews related to the pricing model, some justified.  If you can get past that, you have a really solid, state-of-the-art pinball game that\\'s a meaningful upgrade from FX3.\\n\\nAfter 100+ hours in FX on Epic and 100+ hours in FX3 on a lot of the same tables, the new FX is my go-to platform and the one I see myself playing long into the future.  \\n\\nThe difference is all in the physics.  There\\'s some visual upgrades for sure - which are actually a mixed bag at the moment, because while the game looks great, it\\'s wildly unoptimized - but what\\'s important in pinball is how it /feels/, and FX feels fantastic.  To compare the two, FX3 is fun and springy, easy and arcadey, while FX, to me, feels like far more like playing real pinball.  It\\'s more challenging and realistic, more unpredictable, faster and less forgiving.  The default competitive mode is \"Classic\", which allows you to play for scores and excludes the powerups that were a necessity in the default mode of FX3 if you wanted to top the leaderboards.  If you\\'re still after the powerups, you can find them in \"Arcade\" mode, but \"Classic\" feels great in my hands, and if you want a challenge even above that, there\\'s \"Pro\" mode on each of the Williams tables with a steeper playfield and tougher rules.  \\n\\nThis game is imperfect, and a work in progress (please add proper Ultrawide support!), but it doesn\\'t deserve to be drowned out in negative reviews.  I\\'ll update this with some more detailed thoughts, but if you\\'re any sort of a pinball fan at all, ignore the hubbub and give FX a look.  You\\'ll be glad you did.',\n",
       " \"Having played many hours on Epic, I'm so happy to see this launch on Steam. The biggest draw to Pinball FX is the updated physics system coming from the prior entry, Pinball FX3. While much of this may feel minor at first, the ball behaves far more consistently across different tables and the challenge on the non simulator pinball tables (i.e, Zen Originals and franchise crossovers) is much faster and weighty. Graphically, it is a solid improvement if you have a capable PC. The ray-tracing is nice, although not mandatory. It is much improved over its early access performance, and I now get around 90FPS with max graphics settings at 1440p with ray-tracing enabled. Hey, it's just nice to see those reflections on the glossy board :-) \\n\\nThe elephant in the room is the lack of DLC carryover to the new platform. While unfortunate, I believe this is a passion project geared towards enthusiasts. Recreating each table takes time, so does implementing ray-tracing, updating lighting, and ensuring all of the prior systems work with how the ball and flippers now behave; this is no small feat. Given the DLC packs which discount purchases of updated tables if you already own them on PFX3 (See the legacy bundles), I think it is fair. Zen have provided multiple ways to discount tables and assist long-term players in the transition to the new system. \\n\\nNo, you don't *need* to update to Pinball FX if you are happy with Pinball FX3. Keep your purchases there and keep enjoying the game! Those tables are still great. However if you are an enthusiast, you will enjoy playing these tables with their updated physics along with the already hefty amount of new content. I have particularly enjoyed Wrath of the Elder Gods, Grimm Tales, World War Z and the new William's tables (Addams Family, finally!). \\n\\nTwo thumbs up from me. Zen have really pulled through after their rocky launch on Epic and I'm excited to see how this platform develops for years to come. Between the Punishinly accurate Williams simulations, the video-gamey Zen Originals and numerous franchise crossovers, I believe Pinball FX has truly become THE hub for Pinball, no matter how you engage with the game.\",\n",

       " \"Feels like a frustration simulator. Random attacks magically appear at increasing frequency through the waves, leading up to the final wave being an onslaught of BS moves that CC you, with the ability to default attack enemies or use the healing move being tied to standing still - which is impossible at this point. Even though the point is obviously to survive the 20 waves, it still feels more of a pointless endeavor than other games within this genre. It may be because the enemies are all autopathing looking like they are in a MOBA going to a tower, but they are just doing large loops around the map I think, with no destination. \\n\\nThere are good bits that, if changed quite a bit, may be fun in the future.

       " \"I had high hopes for Sidestep Legends and I really wanted to like it because the concept is neat, but I feel like I keep going back to it and it just doesn't quite click for me. The player is offered a traditional bullet heaven control scheme, with WASD or gamepad stick usage and fixed camera, or one closer to MOBAs with the mouse doing all the heavy lifting. It's all about sidesteps, avoiding enemy attacks, traps and more, with a handful of enemy types roaming on predetermined paths as the mobs in a MOBA unless the player bothers them. Unlike the waves of Vampire Survivors clones, Sidestep Legends barely features any attack that can be used to damage opponents while moving, so players will be required to keep switching between moving and standing still, to dodge and to attack respectively. This is a fun take on the genre for sure, as it adds an extra layer of strategy and decision-making, on top of a higher skill ceiling.\\n\\nThe issue is that it doesn't really feel too rewarding. The enemies are not very varied, and they pose a challenge pretty much only because the player has to stop to fight them, with an initial attack range pre-upgrades that is quite laughable. The base attacks and speeds are also superlow, though upgrades make them a lot more satisfying eventually. The map has XP gems and coins spawn all across, with even treasure chests and challenges filling in the blanks, but often these happen far away from enemies who, remember, follow predetermined paths. The game actively pushes you away from the action a lot of the time, with traps like gas waves, fire areas and hooks pulling the player back for extra challenge. This is the game's incentive to have the player moving... but again, you are supposed to stop to attack, which means that most of the time you will not be attacking, as it doesn't take long before you are looking at a couple dozen enemies and traps are spawning everywhere. \\n\\nCouple all this with fairly unimpressive 3D visuals and a skill tree that's packed with tons of expensive yet minor upgrades, and I just can't say that I truly enjoy or want to recommend this game yet. Even when the upgrades become more satisfying, some higher level skills and characters are unlocked and you're battling against a giant boss, at its core Sidestep Legends feels like you're fighting against the game's design trying to slow your every move and attack more so than the hundreds of identical minions you encounter in a run. A good bullet heaven and a good MOBA both make you feel swift and powerful, and unfortunately that feeling is too rare here for me to recommend the game as of now. I plan to revisit it in the future because it's still in Early Access and I believe the concept can achieve a lot more with some balancing and design tweaks.\\n\\nBullet Heaven Fandom review #47.

On the other hand this is mobile-game levels of pay2win that makes even world of tanks look respectable.\\n\\nSo basically you have a clone (visually) to world of tanks, now you remove ALL of the armor/hit/bounce/pen mechanics. Replace it with two hitboxes per tank, and the tank is hit in Box A (The front/top/front 90% of the sides) that tank takes 50% of the damage done by the gun. If the round hits Box B (The rear and the back 20% of the sides) it takes 100% of the damage done by the gun.\\n\\nThat pretty much sums up the general gunplay, very arcade'y. The game does stir things up a bit with equipment which acts as tank abilities. (Some tanks only have access to certain ones.) Which can set things on fire, place landmines, repair, debuff enemy tanks, buff your tank, etc. And they can be used repeatedly with a long cooldown.\\n\\nThe actual gameplay mechanics make less sense. There are bases for each team, and they can be captured. But they serve no purpose currently, they don't win the match, they don't prevent enemy respawns, they don't get points, nada. Broken/missing mechanics basically. Also players can respawn into ANY tanks they have left after dying, so matches can go on for a LONG time with each player having like 5-12 tanks eventually, there is a time limit however.\\n\\nOk, so onto the bad. The game sells pay2win to some insane levels. decals/camo even give SUBSTANTIAL damage buffs. (like 10% each) There is also gold ammo, but since there is no armor pen/bounce system, it just straight up does +50% damage AND randomly disables any tank shot with it briefly. If you have it, and someone else doesn't, you automatically win ANY shootout, even if your in a light tanks and they are in a heavy tank. There is also pay2win equipment, pay2win premium tanks that are +30% stronger than the normal ones. The list is a mile long on the Pay2win.\\n\\n98% of the enemy tanks are also bots currently. Very few players. The A.I. is pretty good though and acts like a only marginally mentally retarded player. They will also ALWAYS target you immediately if you shoot them, even if they are in a 9-way melee range shootout and you snipe at them from a mile away, they will immediately ignore everything else and fire at you. Making the A.I. effective at killing YOU, but not good at winning a match.\",\n",
       " \"A straightforward action game where you must eliminate enough enemies to advance to the next level. \\n\\nDespite the fact that the game is marketed as a shooter, melee scythe attacks end up being more effective because they hit with a broad swipe. Furthermore, the controls don't operate in a twin-shooter fashion, making it challenging to get the perfect shot. \\n\\nThe main goal of most stages is to eliminate all enemies, but occasionally you also need to accomplish things like close portals that continually create enemies. Because you have to drag an extremely slow ball to the portal, these stages aren't very good. The fact that you must always stay close makes things worse; if you stray too far, it will stop following.\\n\\nProgress can’t be lost. Dying just requires you to restart the current level and keep trying until you succeed. The following stage may be made even more challenging, though. Health is carried over to the next stage along with everything else you've acquired, such as ammo and souls that act as currency. \\n\\nThe problem happens if you finish the stage with only a few health bars.

I found it super interesting how they decided to expand the world of Tron and it makes me excited they're trying to reach out past the light cycles and disc games. IMO I don't really like some of the expansions to the world and the major secret trouble (no spoiler pog) feels a little off. However, I'm glad someone has a new take of what Tron can be. \\n\\nAfter all what is Tron? I think Tron is the exploration and intrigue of a cool idea. Discs, cycles, trees, and puzzles are just cool ideas branching off. I give this game a solid recommend. 6.5/10 for casuals and very enjoyable 2-6 hours of decently replayable experience. I'm off to do homework before starting a new run that's for sure.\",\n",
       " \"I understand that there will be more episodes later down the line. So the pricing isn't an issue for me. My issue is the lack of substance in the writing. The developer like the boast about how this is specifically a visual novel, but fail to understand decent writing is an important part of that. If you're going to disregard that the majority of your fan base came from your AVN college kings, then fine. But you'll have to come with your A game if you're going to leave out explicit content, and strictly rely on your writing merit. And FYI CK DIDN'T HAVE GOOD WRITING!\\n\\nThere's nothing interesting about the plot in this game. The main character is childlike and whiny, and his friends are unbearable. The only 2 characters that are solid is River and the brother Lance. Who the game is trying its best to paint as a bad dude, but instead paints the MC as a whiny brat who doesn't care about his family. \\n\\nAll choices you pick are in a range of being either neutral or whiny. And a lot of the time, are confusing to understand in the context of the conversation being had. But in the end that doesn't matter, because dialogue is stilted and uninspiring anyway. I'd say if you're interested, either wait for a sell for this single episode. Or wait for all chapters to release.\",\n",

       " \"A very well made game with a wonderful cutesy art style. The player has a lot of control over the outcome of things, which doesn't always happen with deck builders, and there seems to be limitless ways to succeed. I haven't yet seen any bugs, and there haven't been any issues performance-wise, even though my computer isn't the greatest. Overall, I would highly recommend.\",\n",
       " \"I want to recommend this game if you enjoy deckbuilders and roguelites, but in its current state I can't promise you will have a great time. The mechanics themselves; the cards, abilities, effects, and companions, all have something really neat, but it's buried under a horribly unbalanced experience. I'm going to start by highlighting what feels incredibly weak on the player's end. \\nThe hero: Having a choice between three different heroes with random stats and abilities is fine on paper, but Wildfrost's execution of this leaves a lot to be desired. Your hero is frustratingly weak, has long attack cooldowns, and usually an attack stat of MAYBE 3-4. If your hero's death is your losing condition, they should feel more impactful. I know devs might not be the same, but this is the same glaring issue in another game chucklefish published; Wargroove. Another attempt to capture a niche but passionate audience but make lose conditions around losing your commander who has cool abilities and stats, so you are actually given incentive into NOT using them and mainly just keeping them safe. My hero feels weaker than first encounter mobs and can die in two good hits. One of the points of the genre is to start out weak and work your way up, but there is such a thing as too weak to even make it to the first step on the ladder. \\nCompanions: Cute feature and an added layer of deckbuilding to help guide you to a strong composition. Companions not only taking a card slot but ALSO a turn to put them on the field, is an exercise is design masochism. The enemies will usually have a field of 2-3 enemies, and 3-4 in some later fights. Forcing the player to start out 1v4 is unreasonable given the current card pool and balance state. I think being able to put charms on companions is nice, but I think I would have preferred a level up system where they progress naturally, since I am 4/5 times focusing on putting charms on my much more efficient companions instead of my hero. \\nCards: A basic system that works almost as expected. Again, the turn rotation and action allotment really hurts the experience. I am basically forced to place companions on the board before playing any cards that actually effect my enemies, and even then 4/5 times I am playing cards to keep me from losing instead of bringing me closer to victory. The cards almost feel like an afterthought when you look at Wildfrost's combat through the scope of an autobattler. If heroes could play more than 1 attack card a turn, the deck would feel a lot better to play with. \\n\\nLet's talk about enemies and encounters now\\nEnemies: Battles are randomized in a sense where you will face certain preset compositions picked from a pool. While this can present a challenge in the form that you are facing against a group of enemies that synergize with one another, it is also ball busting at times since they are much more optimized than you, the player can hope to be. Compounded with the fact that their board fields with units without a need to use a turn of action, you are often felt like you are fighting uphill the entire encounter. It doesn't feel rewarding to beat some of these encounters since not only do you not get anything besides currency, they don't feel like true wins since likely had just scrounged up protection for your hero and had cool downs tick at the right times. Enemy cooldown times are also extremely in their favor. If their abilities and attack stats were not so strong, this wouldn't be as big an issue, but whenever even ONE enemy is ready to do their move next I feel like I am forced to either slow them down, kill them somehow, or just accept that I'm making something eat the attack. Enemy compositions will likely appear that are an exact counter to your current build. Again, it wouldn't be so bad if the balance was in a better place. \\nMap encounters: Cute idea, but not enough steps and impact on the run. I feel like with how powerful the enemies are, I need at least another rest spot or two to appropriately gear me for the next one. \\n\\nOverall, while this game has some decent art and nice groundwork for its mechanics, I can't suggest anyone pay the 20 bucks it costs just to run into the balancing problems a lot of people are facing. If decks, heroes, and companions were more in our control, yeah the difficulty could be managed as you can find a consistent way to overcome the encounters, but when you're thrown a bunch of weak combos that will not get you further than 2-3 battles, it just feels bad. I sincerely hope the developers take some of the feedback to heart and try to tackle the game's balance a little. It would be a shame for a project like this to just fade into the basement tote of generic and unsatisfying deckbuilders.\",\n",

With Fabledom, you feel the love they put into their project. There's a story here that will be fleshed out along with the game's development - delivered by game mechanics and a fantastic, sort of nostalgic narrator. The art style is very well crafted, allowing an indie team to seem like they're competing with PIXAR. The game has hints of Banished, Manor Lords, and in some sense, ANNO 1800. The game is calm and easy-going. I saw one comment that was pretty on point - Fabledom feels like how the new Settlers game should have felt.\\n\\nAnd my top compliment - this game allows for travelling the map, and does a great mix of cute, cartoony city-building, with later-on added elements of combat. You can eventually build a castle and the surrounding walls, with both footmen and archers. \\n\\nOverall, support the game, support their art. Give it a try!\\n\\nTo note though - two negatives. One, as with most city-builders, the game is too easy. Again with other city builders, I doubt there's an End screen. The focus is of course actually building, designing, and decorating a city. But it needs far greater challenges and true game-ending events, if the player isn't focused or strategic. This might be mitigated slightly when combat is introduced soon.\\n\\nTwo - so far, nothing is really new here. You can tell there's love from the devs from this project.

       " '[h1]More Stuff, Still Short and Cute[/h1]\\n\\n\\n[i]Plantera 2: The Golden Acorn[/i] is a worthy sequel that adds new stuff, but still is as short and cute as its predecessor.  It\\'s an idle game, but it moves [i][b]very[/b][/i] fast.\\n\\nThe basic premise of the game is that you are growing a garden and raising livestock.  Right away you notice a nice-sized oak tree smack in the middle.  This oak is the only thing that you will not be able to move or delete in your side-scrolling garden.\\n\\nYou are asked to click on some butterflies to catch them for coins with which you can buy your first crop, leeks.  Eventually, you will be able to buy berry bushes and other fruit shrubs, fruit trees, and animals, all with drops to collection.  You also can have two production buildings: jam-making machines and windmills.  The buildings don\\'t seem to depend on production chains, though.\\n\\nOnce ripe, ground crops need to be clicked to pull them out of the ground and clicked again to sell.  Fruit on bushes and trees can be clicked when ripe to make them fall, and again to sell.\\n\\nFortunately, you are given at the start a Mellow, a cute blue round helper with a bland placid expression and a bag over its shoulder.  You can just let the little guy go pick up fruit, or you can click on stuff to help him.\\n\\nHang out with the game, and you will notice various mean critters that show up to mess with your garden.  Magpies steal crops.  Bunnies eat ground crops.  Boars and foxes harass certain animals and make them less productive.  You can click on them a few times to shoo them away.\\n\\nOne tab, the Special tab with the blue star, includes some things to help you with the critters.  Scarecrows and fences help keep the critter population down and help you with offline earnings.  Guard dogs scare off the critters.\\n\\nThe coins you earn double as XP to level up your garden.  New levels give you more helpers, garden expansions to purchase, and unlock new crops and items.\\n\\nThose levels come FAST!  Spend time with game adding or swapping out crops and expanding the garden, and in just two hours, you\\'ll get 15-20 levels.  A few more hours, and you\\'ve unlocked everything.\\n\\nAnother progress bar tracks the acorns you\\'ve earned.  These upgrade the oak tree and add things like birdhouses and beehives, and acorns.  Regular brown acorns can be sold for coin, while golden acorns give you the upgrade acorns when sold.\\n\\nAfter you\\'ve unlocked everything and gotten all the achievements, there\\'s still a couple things left to do.  You can try to see how far the garden can be expanded, for instance.\\n\\nAs you expand the garden further, you might also completely remodel it.\\n\\nThe game gets cluttered and busy pretty quickly.  This is due to the layers used.  Ground crops take one layer, bushes and shrubs another, and trees a third.  Another couple layers are for the special stuff, and yet another for the animals.  Each crop/building layer has limited slots.  The game does make it fairly easy to move or delete stuff.  A layer toggle helps to isolate items to delete or move.  Prices revert to how much you have currently installed, so demolishing everything reverts to starting prices.\\n\\nWith a few more expansions, there\\'s plenty of room to have each crop in isolation if you wish.\\n\\nYou also still keep leveling up after you\\'ve unlocked everything.  Crops and animals eventually earn star upgrades with new levels.  It\\'s unclear exactly what this upgrades, though.\\n\\nYou\\'ll also earn more acorns to upgrade the oak.  Acorns can also activate some God Mode powers, mostly to increase Mellow helper speed and crop production speed.\\n\\nThere is, of course, a restart function to start a clean new game, so you can set some challenge for yourself or just revisit the game.\\n\\nThe dev is open to suggestions to what to add to the game, too, so the game might be worth hanging on to for a while.\\n\\n\\nGraphics are bright and colorful and cheery, with the animals done in a fat, squat, almost cute style.  Music has a relaxing, bouncy vibe.\\n\\nIf you liked the first game, you\\'ll probably like this game, unless the speed at which you  unlock everything puts you off.\\n\\nIf you want an idle game you can actually \"finish,\" instead of numbers rising to infinity, you might like this game.\\n\\nIf you like gardening games, but don\\'t like the hassle of tilling and watering and producing stuff yourself, you might like this game.\\n\\nAt any rate, it\\'s very cheap in terms of time and money to try.',\n",

       " 'Incredible game but will take some time to fully grasp and has some places to improve. But it is Early Access so I’m looking forward to see how this game progresses!\\n\\nSome things to note:\\n\\nThe tutorial is serviceable, it teaches you the movement controls and combat controls well enough, but it’ll take you some time to get used to unless you’ve played other games with similar space mechanics like Space Engineers or Hardspace: Shipbreaker. Something I feel it lacks is letting you know about how interactive the maps are. Until I bumped into something with a button prompt, I had no idea I could open/close airlocks, pressurize sections, or ride cables. The tutorial should’ve at least had an example of this because it is really cool.\\n\\nThe class customization and the classes themselves lend to a lot of variety but there are some classes that tend to be more popular than others. Some special ordinances are clearly better than others and I can see some balancing rework being needed for some.\\n\\nThe actual combat is just downright awesome and it really is a tactical space shooter. 3D tactics feels both empowering and threatening as flanking maneuvers are so much more dynamic. Combat is intense and the map design blends close quarters combat with large open combat very well.\\n\\nSpeaking of map design. They’re some of the best I’ve seen. They are molded perfectly to their respective game modes. The only problem I could see is sometimes spawn locations can drop you in right on top of the enemy if they’re at your spawn. I didn’t suffer any spawn camping but I can definitely see it happening.\\n\\nI saw other reviews talking about bugs or bad connection, and they very well may have experienced that, but I didn’t experience any kind of problems like that. My game kept up good connection, consistent frame rate, no graphical errors, or anything.\\n\\nOverall I highly recommend it and look forward to seeing this game grow.

Murderous Muses is a first-person supernatural murder mystery game where you must discover who killed Mordechai Grey by investigating portraits that you hang throughout the gallery. The portraits come to life and give snippets of information which you use to discover the actual killer among the 6 suspects. This isn't a premade story on rails like many FMV games. It's a first-person adventure where you have to figure out what goes where and how, or risk missing out on important information. And every playthrough is randomized with a random murderer, evidence and environments! No two playthroughs look or play the same, SO much changes between playthroughs. You can easily play it several times and get significantly different experiences. \\n\\nThe game takes place over a couple days, each having a distinct day and night time. During the day, you receive new paintings and place them across the gallery, discovering the history of the area and important lore about locations.  At night, the gallery comes to life and you can investigate the paintings for information.   \\n\\nI really like how it doesn't hold your hand. You get a little tutorial and then you're let loose in the gallery. You need to do a bit of sleuthing to figure out how the mechanics all work. And if you blow through the days you can easily miss major information. You might not win your playthrough if you mess up enough, which I love. FMV games are almost always too easy, but Murderous Muses actually asks you to use your brain and powers of deduction. And since each playthrough is unique, you take what you've learned about the game to make your next run better while experiencing a fresh killer and set of evidence. \\n\\nLots of little easter eggs and secrets and the cool collectible room ensure I'll play this quite a few times through. There is a ton of lore to be found and many ways to approach the Muses. My first playthrough was about 4 hours, but I'm piecing through everything I can get my fingers on, YMMV. Even when you've discovered the killer, there's still plenty to uncover...there's a lot more going on than just the murder. It should take 4ish playthroughs to get all the achievements.\\n\\nI find Murderous Muses an amazing title, through and through. The acting, writing and soundtrack are overall incredible, it's replayable and SO engaging. I can't get over how much changes between playthroughs, and I'm absolutely enthralled with Mirlhaven. I can't recommend this enough. And if you enjoy this and other FMV games, make sure to check out D'Avekki's other titles. Every game is a masterpiece, they all play differently and they're all in the same universe! \\n\\nFind other reviews on [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/34183438/] MY CURATOR PAGE [/url]\",\n",
       " 'The game is fun and beneath the balancing issues is a interesting deck builder. But I have to agree with most negative reviews here. I LOVED the demo but what I think this game desperately need is a more divers path of enemies. For the most part you can make some pretty busted builds as usual for a rogue-like, but enemy encounters can just outright counter your deck strategy very usually since the game does not offer much diversity with deck creativity. If you could at least have two options in the path as to what enemy you are to face, I could enjoy myself without the frustration of praying as to WHO I will face. \\nSo prepare to be leaning HARD into the RNG luck of not ONLY what you get but what enemies you will face. You either synergize or die.',\n",

       " 'the devs really thought the only way to make their game more replayable was to ramp up the difficulty so you never reach the end lmao',\n",
       " \"This game has a lot going for it, and a lot that could be improved. Wildfrost nails the art, mechanics, acension system, UX and  ease of understanding. Everything follows a consistent logic which although it can take many tries to learn the specifics it has never left me feeling like they made a mistake. \\n\\nI would say that the game falls flat when it comes to consistency between runs. RNG is expected for the roguelike genre but in this case it affects every aspect of the game including the most important of your 2 starting units, the leader, which has to remain on the board the entire fight and if it dies its game over. All fights come as one of 2 versions, with a different set of enemies for each. The issue with this is that they can be WILDLY different in how tough they are. The events between fights are also mostly random - this is alright as the events are balanced enough and the shop events even things out because it's never required to buy a card at a shop, and the coins can be saved up at bad shops until you find one with the items you want.\\n\\nBy far the most aggravating RNG comes at the very beginning of the run with the choice of 1 of 3 randomly generated heroes. Some of the heroes are leagues stronger than others. It makes a huge difference in getting a run off the ground. Unfortunately, resetting after having a bad hero selection counts as a loss so if you care about winstreaks or win rates this adds frustration. I prefer not to start scum but winning feels way more achievable when I start with a good hero. \\nThis actually gets WORSE with the ascension perks as you only have one hero available from each faction. The starting faction is the most powerful, the 2nd one is good, and the 3rd faction is the worst. So although I will prefer using one of the factions I do not have much of a choice when the one hero from it sucks. Factions determine your starting deck and a large amount of the available cards during the run, which makes this very important.\\n\\nThe biggest RNG in fights occurs at the first boss fight. It spawns with either the King Moko or the 2 tall Mecha boss. King moko is essentiatlly a 7-turn death timer, in which you have to kill the boss before he attacks or else he wipes out your entire board. On top of that he has 60 health which is very high at that point in the game, so the only way to beat him is through having units attack him enough times that the attack bonus he gives builds up and is enough to chew through his health. The mecha boss on the other hand only had 18 health in the first phase, and 15 health in the second phase, and does 2 damage. The attack is super easy to tank in the second phase and 18 health is only twice as much as the regular enemies. I don't mind the fight being difficult, but the variation in balancing is laughable.\\n\\nNow for the reasons why I like the game. I'll start with listing specific mechanics outside of the basics you're taught in the tutorial and through text:\\n\\ncombat order goes top down, from the inside of the board outward starting on the enemies side and then letting the players side go through actions. All effects tick after attacks have happened.\\n\\nNoomlings make cards completely free to play, as such if you have multiple cards with noomlings in your hand you can play all of them without using your turn\\n\\nCompanions can be put into reserve (you still have them but they're not in your deck for battle) at any time, with a limit of 3 companions going into battle\\n\\nAll effects are useful on every unit type, including bosses. This is handy because it means effect synergies can't get hard countered, and remain viable in each fight. The only exception is that some boss and non-boss units have snow resist, which means that they can only have 1 snow stacked at one time. Snow is an effect which delays that units attack timer by the amount of snow, this stops the player from being able to prevent a bosses attack entirely. This is different to slay the spire, which has units which are immune to different types of effects. \\n\\nMechanics like 'sacrificing' where friendly cards have to be killed to gain a bonus are not treated any differently from any other way of a card dying - in one instance I had a card which applies 4 overburn get sacrificed by another unit, and it ended up applying the overburn to my own unit, killing it. Heroes are also treated like any companions by other cards because my own hero got killed when another card triggered its sacrifice on the row it was in.\\n\\nWhy do I like the game, even with those issues I've described? I still find a lot of fun in the strategy that comes with every decision made - whether to go with what's best in the next fight, or try to find a broken synergy 2 fights from now. To build a good deck it's always a good idea to have more than one strong unit and synergy because many of the fights test decks in specific areas. There is one fight where the enemies all have a lot of block shielding which blocks individual instances of damage. If you used a strong single damage dealer to get through previous fights it adds a lot of challenge because the attacks of that damage dealer will only remove one block, the same as if it did 1. To defeat the enemies you need either a strong defensive setup which lets you chip away at the opponent's blocks or many fast attacking units to destroy their threatening units quickly.\\n\\nThe most fun I've had with this game was naming my cards and messing around with OP charm combos, when I beat the game with my leader called 'YOUR MOTHER'. Now she resides at the final boss fight every time, with all of the broken combos which I created with those units alongside her. Every time I've gotten back to that point since I have lost to YOUR MOTHER I'm determined to build a more OP deck so I can see what happens when I beat the fight for a second time.\",\n",

The runs are just short so every fight needs to feel lethal.  That being said I do think this game FEELS random.  There is just so much going on in the game that it's super difficult to keep up with and I found myself not understanding how I lost.  Feels like sometimes the stars will align and either you'll just randomly kill the boss or the enemies will just randomly kill you.\\n\\nI don't even have 6 hours and I already stumbled my way into my first victory.

       " 'Naked Gnome OP <3\\n\\nNotable innovations to the card-battler genre from an artistic and mechanical standpoint. Board positioning is essential, as is paying attention to the minute details of enemy effects and attack patterns.\\n\\nThis game is extremely punishing, and for me that is very motivating to keep playing. This is not a game where you can afford to zone out, and it holds tension even in the early battles of each run.\\n\\nHowever, there are some changes that would probably make the game more fun. I think a system of re-rolling hero selections would be nice, because it\\'s not fun to feel the need to play a hero that is almost identical to one you played in your previous run. There\\'s some needlessly difficult interactions such as Monch insta-killing your avatar. It made me laugh, but it\\'s really not necessary to have as many small \"gotchas\" like this to keep the game challenging.\\n\\nI\\'m also not sure that forcing card selection from chests is necessary. Similar games such as Slay the Spire let the player opt to take nothing at all, which is often preferable than making an off-synergy pick. The large hand-size and bell re-draw system does already mitigate the drawbacks of having a dud in your deck, but I think the game is challenging enough that it could support players running leaner, meaner strategies earlier.\\n\\nOr, as much as I like the injury mechanic, maybe just remove it or make it reduce the creature\\'s stats incrementally rather than by half? \\n\\nWho knows without play-testing, but I\\'d consider some graceful ways to slightly re-balance.',\n",

And funny. \\n\\nThings I Don't Like: \\n- The pixel style of graphics: The indie shooter's unimpressive go-to for art style. Dusk. Nightmare Reaper. Cultic. Ultrakill. Gloomwood. And now MeatGrinder. It's just my preference. I don't like it and I grew up playing Star Wars Dark Forces 1+2! Although, this one is actual 3D all the way through. \\n- Within 28 minutes I had a lot of repeated voice lines from the protagonist. I even turned down the frequency in which he speaks, but it didn't stop him from saying 'I LOVE THIS SONG' every time the music changes. \\n\\nOverall, an absolutely killer title for the price. \\nAnd I totally recommend listening to the Mad Max Fury Road chase music if you get bored of the metal. \\nhttps://youtu.be/IXb-9v9FLDA\",\n",
